367.00006; With the company having a huge net cash position, a combination of dividends, net share settlements, and share repurchases has returned almost $400 billion since.
367.00008; (Source: Apple capital return plan document, seen here)  In the past six quarters, the company has brought its net cash position down by more than a third, from $163 billion to $102 billion. That's primarily because management stepped in with some huge quarterly share repurchases.
367.00013; If Apple reduces its net cash position by $28 billion every six months until the end of calendar 2020, then the reduction will leave it with just $18 billion in net cash.
367.00017; Regardless of when that does actually occur, the company still produces tremendous free cash flow each fiscal year, averaging about $58 billion per fiscal year over the last five (not counting the period we are currently in) as seen below.
367.00021; Well, the dividend is currently running at about $14 billion a year, and let's assume another $10 billion per goes to debt repayments and $1 billion goes to acquisitions. That would leave $35 billion a year to go to share repurchases, meaning Apple could still buy back more than $8 billion a quarter and still be at a cash neutral position.
367.00023; As the company reduces its share count further by the quarter, the buyback becomes even more important for the same number of shares repurchased. For example, when the share count after the split was about 6.5 billion, a 100 million share count reduction would improve EPS by 1.54%.
367.00024; Now, we are roughly at 4.5 billion shares, meaning every 100 million lowering now boosts EPS by 2.22%.

547.00032; (Source: vanadiumprice.com)  2. AMG Technologies had a temporary bad quarter as well, with EBITDA decreasing 40% QoQ to $11.4 mln. This was caused due to lower prices in the Titanium Alloys and Coatings business and timing effects in the Engineering business.
547.00033; As a consequence of seasonality (orders are very variable), they only signed $33 mln in orders in Q2.
547.00043; (Source: AMG Investor relations)  AMG Technologies valuation  CEO Heinz said  we should expect flat EBITDA in AMG Technologies basically year-on-year in 2019. Thus, in my assumption I take $68 mln in EBITDA for 2019.
547.00045; I expect them to resume the growth trajectory with 20% annual EBITDA growth because Heinz stated in the cc that we can expect more growth ahead of us:  And it also refers to the titanium aluminide, which are especially strong and where we are about to increase our contractual position -- sales position substantially.
547.0005; Total EBITDA is guided at $120 mln in 2019. As such, Critical Materials' EBITDA should be at least $52 mln.
547.00051; According to Heinz, the EBITDA run rate is $150 mln under normal circumstances (no extraordinary price fluctuations for vanadium). Consequently, 2020 EBITDA is expected to be at least $150 mln.
547.00054; AMG has low operational costs of $270/mt, while current spot prices are $680/mt. Thus, it would create $12.3 mln annual ebitda.
547.00055; Secondly, AMG announced that it will at least double its recycling capacity in 2021, which would probably start adding to profitability in 2022. I guess that Cambridge 1, the current recycling factory, creates $50 mln annual EBITDA (consisting of fees and vanadium sales). Thus, this new facility (Cambridge 2) should add at least another $50 mln in EBITDA.
0547.00060.1; I use a 4x EV/EBITDA multiple for this division which is very low because it is currently seen as a cyclical business, operating in mining and materials. In Q2 for example, the prices of AMG's materials portfolio were the lowest in the history of the company. Consequently, EBITDA sank by a stunning 66% YoY in this division.

In Q2 for example, the prices of AMG's materials portfolio were the lowest in the history of the company. Consequently, EBITDA sank by a stunning 66% YoY in this division.
547.00065; As you can see in the table, value per share could grow to $71.96 in 2024, a 233% gain from today's share price. Adding both divisions together, EBITDA could grow from $120 mln in 2019 to $353 mln in 2024 based on my calculations.
547.00072; As calculated above, the division should be valued $21.07 per share based on $82 mln EBITDA in 2020 and a conservative EV/EBITDA multiple of 9.
547.00073; If the Technologies division could achieve this valuation via a separate listing, it will be very unlikely that AMG stock would drop below this $21.07 point.

So if the Market Price RAD is $400,000 and you pay $200,000, you will pay the remaining $200,000 at 5.54 per cent interest as a daily fee, which is $30.36 a day. If you pay the full RAD there is no interest (DAP) pay no RAD and you will pay a DAP which is the interest on the full amount: $22,160.

555.00006; Factoring in around a 2% dividend yield, the annual total return is more than 18%.
555.00019; Luckily, earnings were back up last year and it seems it will continue up this year. Consequently, I am not too worried about the payout ratio as it should land comfortably below 50% on this year's earnings.
555.00026; An EPS of $20.85 would mean that the company grows earnings a full 18.5% from the 2018 level of $17.59.
555.00031; Given the conservative payout ratio there is clearly enough money to invest in profitable projects so the natural way to reward shareholders would be to offer decent dividend growth on the back of strong earnings growth. I therefore see no compelling reason for an unusually low hike this year. My prediction is therefore that the company will land somewhere in the middle, i.e. offer a dividend hike in-line with recent years of 10%.

597.00002; By Karin Matussek and Christoph Rauwald | Sep 24, 2019  (Bloomberg)  -  Germany's embattled car industry suffered a one-two blow after prosecutors charged Volkswagen AG's two top executives with market manipulation in the four-year-old diesel scandal and Daimler AG was fined in a separate probe for rigging vehicles. The charge against VW's leaders was brought by prosecutors in Braunschweig, near the company's Wolfsburg headquarters, alleging that Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess, Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch and former CEO Martin Winterkorn were too slow to inform investors about their diesel findings. Within hours, a separate decision by Stuttgart prosecutors fined Daimler 870 million euros ($957 million) in a probe into their diesel cars.
597.00007; With their top managers now in the firing line, Volkswagen was dealt a dramatic setback in the scandal that has been haunting the carmaker since September 2015, when it admitted using software in 11 million diesel vehicles to cheat on emissions tests. At the time, Diess had just joined the company. The toll has so far reached 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in fines and other expenses for the firm and the proceedings could drag on during a period when it's facing a shift to electric cars and slower sales in some key markets.
597.00014; VW shares fell 3% in Frankfurt, while Daimler slumped 1.7%. The Volkswagen market-manipulation probe was prompted by Germany's financial regulator Bafin, which in mid-2016 asked prosecutors to investigate Winterkorn and Diess.

0;During the third quarter, sales improved substantially compared to the second quarter. This was driven by several factors, including an improvement in our merchandise assortments, a 25later back-to-school season, stronger performance in our larger markets, and our return to more normal store hours.
1;Our fourth quarter sales remained suppressed due to the negative impact from the upsurge in the virus that resulted in reduced customer traffic and more stringent occupancy and store operating hours restrictions.
2;In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we refinanced $775 million in aggregate principal amount of higher interest senior notes with the issuance of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of lower interest rate senior notes. This action resulted in a refinancing charge of approximately $240 million in the third quarter, but will significantly reduce our annual interest expense and total cash outlays over the life of the debt.
3;Sales for fiscal 2020 decreased $3.5 billion, or 21.9%, compared to the prior year. This was primarily due to the negative impact from store closures during the March 2020 to June 2020 period, the negative impact on customer demand from the COVID-19 pandemic, mandated occupancy restrictions, and reduced store operating hours during the remainder of fiscal 2020.
4;Cost of goods sold in fiscal 2020 decreased $1.7 billion compared to the prior year mainly due to the lower sales from the temporary closure of all store locations (starting on March 20, 2020 through a portion of the second quarter of fiscal 2020), and ensuing negative impact on customer demand from the COVID-19 pandemic after our store reopenings, as well as lower costs from the temporary furlough of most hourly associates in our distribution centers and some associates in our buying offices.
5;For fiscal 2020, selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) increased $146.6 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to approximately $240 million in long-term debt refinancing costs, COVID-related expenses (including for supplies, cleaning, and payroll related to additional safety protocols), and payments to associates while our stores were closed (net of employee retention credits under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”)), partially offset by payroll-related cost reduction measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (including the temporary furlough of most hourly associates in our stores during closure periods, and some associates in our corporate offices), reductions in non-business critical operating expenses, and lower store operating expenses on lower sales.
6;As we enter 2021, we expect our operating costs to continue to reflect ongoing COVID-related expenses and also higher wages. For fiscal 2019, SG&A increased $140.2 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 88 net new stores during the year.
7;SG&A as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2019 decreased by approximately 10 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to leverage on higher sales.28Interest expense (income), net.
8;In fiscal 2020, net interest expense increased by $101.5 million compared to 2019 primarily due to higher interest expense on long-term debt due to the issuance of Senior Notes in April 2020 and October 2020 (net of repurchase of Senior Notes), lower interest income due to lower interest rates, and higher interest expense on short-term debt due to the draw down on our $800 million revolving credit facility in March 2020 (which was subsequently repaid in October 2020), partially offset by higher capitalized interest primarily related to the construction of our Brookshire, Texas distribution center.
9;In fiscal 2019, we resolved uncertain tax positions with a state tax authority. As a result, we recognized a tax benefit of approximately $10.0 million in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
10;In fiscal 2018, we resolved uncertain tax positions related to fiscal 2015 with the Internal Revenue Service. As a result, we recognized a tax benefit of approximately $26.0 million in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law.
11;Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2020 were lower than in fiscal 2019, primarily due to higher cost of goods sold, higher SG&A expenses, and higher interest expense.
12;Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2019 were lower compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher cost of goods sold, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses and higher interest income.Earnings per share.
13;Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020 was $0.24, compared to $4.60 in the prior year. The lower diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to lower sales due to the closing of all our store locations starting on March 20, 2020 through a portion the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and the negative impact on customer demand from the COVID-19 pandemic, higher markdowns to clear aged and seasonal inventory, long-term debt refinancing costs, payments to associates while our stores were closed (net of employee retention credits under the CARES Act), and higher expenditures for COVID-19 related measures.
14;Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2019 was $4.60, which included a per share benefit of approximately $0.02 primarily related to the favorable resolution of a tax matter, compared to $4.26 in the prior year, which included a per share benefit of approximately $0.07 from the favorable resolution of a tax matter.
15;In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we refinanced $775 million in aggregate principal amount of higher interest senior notes with the issuance of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of lower interest rate senior notes. This action resulted in a refinancing charge of approximately $240 million in the third quarter, but will significantly reduce our annual interest expense and total cash outlays over the life of the debt.
16;Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, and was primarily driven by net earnings excluding non-cash expenses for depreciation and amortization and for deferred taxes.
17;The increase in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by higher accounts payable leverage.
18;The increase in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by higher earnings and the timing of merchandise receipts and related payments versus the prior year.
19;The increase in accounts payable leverage in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by lower packaway and in-store inventory and extended payment terms.
20;The increase in accounts payable leverage in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by timing of merchandise receipts and related payments versus the prior year.
21;The decrease in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to a reduction in our capital expenditures.
22;The increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in our capital expenditures.
23;The increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to investments in our distribution centers, and information technology infrastructure investments for our stores, buying, corporate offices, and transportation.
24;The increase in cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2020, compared to fiscal 2019, was primarily due to the completion of our public debt offerings, net of repurchase and refinancing costs, and the suspension of our share repurchases and dividends in the second quarter of 2020.
25;As of January 30, 2021, we were in compliance with these amended covenants. In October 2020, we repaid in full the $800 million we borrowed under the unsecured revolving credit facility. As a result, we currently have no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding under this facility, and the $800 million credit facility remains in place and available.
26;During 2018, we recognized charges totaling $417 million related to projects in the Energy & Chemicals, Infrastructure & Power and Other segments.
27;These project charges were partially offset by a gain of $125 million from the sale of a joint venture interest in the United Kingdom.
28;During 2019, consolidated revenue declined primarily due to volume declines on Energy & Chemicals projects as well as the completion of a power restoration project in Puerto Rico in 2018 and three large power projects in 2019.
29;During 2020, total segment profit increased due to the project charges in the Energy & Chemicals, Infrastructure & Power and Other segments recognized in 2019 (discussed above).
30;During 2019, total segment profit significantly declined due to the 2019 project charges in the Energy & Chemicals, Infrastructure & Power and Other segments.
31;The 2020 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by a $125 million benefit due to the utilization of a 2019 net operating loss carryback as allowed under the CARES ACT enacted on March 27, 2020.
32;This benefit was offset by a $149 million increase in valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets primarily in the U.S. and the Netherlands.
33;The 2019 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by $731 million in charges related to establishing valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia.
34;The 2018 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted due to a $79 million increase in valuation allowances to reduce certain deferred tax assets in the U.S., the Netherlands and Belgium.
35;Revenue in 2019 decreased compared to 2018 due to a significant decline in the volume of customer-furnished materials and project execution activities, combined with the impact of a lower volume of broad based new awards.
36;Segment profit significantly increased during 2020 despite the adverse impacts of the recognition of reserves totaling $60 million for expected credit losses associated with certain joint venture clients, as well as margin diminution on a percentage-of-completion basis resulting from project positions taken with respect to COVID-19 related schedule delays and associated cost growth. The increase in segment profit during 2020 is primarily the result of charges taken during 2019, discussed below.
37;Excluding these items, segment profit declined in 2020 due to the reduced execution activity of the upstream, downstream and chemicals projects discussed above, partially offset by the increase in activity for the LNG project and a decrease in overhead.
38;Segment profit in 2019 significantly decreased compared to 2018 as a result of charges taken during 2019 including $260 million for cost growth on an offshore project, $87 million for cost growth on two downstream projects and scope reductions on a large upstream project, $26 million for the write-off of pre-contract costs, $26 million on embedded foreign currency derivatives and $31 million from the resolution of close-out matters.
39;Segment profit margin in 2020 was also adversely impacted by a shift from higher margin work in 2019 to lower margin work in 2020 in certain geographies.
40;Revenue increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to increased execution activities for several large mining projects as well as ramping up construction activity on the two advanced technologies projects.
41;Segment profit declined in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a gain of $31 million recognized in 2019 resulting from a favorable resolution of a longstanding customer dispute on a mining project.
42;Segment profit in 2020 was also adversely impacted by the decline in activity for the life sciences project and mining projects nearing completion as well as the mining project in South America that was impacted by COVID-19.
43;Segment profit in 2019 increased compared to 2018 due to the increased volume of execution activities for the large mining projects and the two advanced technologies projects that drove the increase in revenue as well as the favorable resolution of the customer dispute.
44;The decline in segment profit margin in 2020 and the increase in segment profit margin in 2019 was primarily the result of the favorable resolution of the customer dispute in 2019.
45;Revenue in 2019 decreased compared to 2018 primarily due to the substantial completion of the three large power projects during 2019.
46;Segment profit in 2020 significantly improved compared to 2019 primarily due to forecast revisions on several power and infrastructure projects recognized in 2019 (discussed below).
47;Segment profit in 2019 significantly decreased compared to 2018 due to charges of $135 million for the settlement of client disputes and cost growth on certain close-out matters for the three power projects discussed above and $133 million resulting from late engineering changes, schedule-driven cost growth and negotiations with clients and subcontractors on pending change orders for several infrastructure projects.
48;Segment profit in 2018 included $188 million in charges on one of the aforementioned power projects as a result of cost growth and a $125 million gain associated with the sale of a joint venture interest in the United Kingdom.
49;The changes in segment profit margin in 2020 and 2019 were primarily attributable to the same factors impacting segment profit in those years.
50;The decrease in 2020 revenue was further driven by the recognition of service fee revenue in 2019 upon the favorable settlement of project claims on two cancelled nuclear power projects in the U.S.
51;Revenue in 2019 decreased compared to 2018 substantially driven by the completion of a power restoration project in Puerto Rico in 2018 as well as a decrease in project execution activities for a logistics assistance program in Afghanistan, partially offset by an increase in execution activities at the Savannah River DOE site and the favorable settlement of the two nuclear power plant projects in 2019.
52;The decrease in segment profit in 2020 was substantially driven by the favorable settlement of the two nuclear power plant projects in 2019 as well as the completion of the nuclear decommissioning project in 2019 and the decline in FEMA work in 2020.
53;The increase in segment profit in 2019 was due to the favorable settlement of the two nuclear power plant projects.
54;The changes in segment profit margin in 2020 and 2019 were primarily attributable to the same factors that affected revenue and segment profit.
55;Revenue in 2019 decreased compared to 2018 primarily due to lower volumes in the Stork business in Europe, the cancellation of a large operations and maintenance project in North America in 2018 and scope reductions on a maintenance project in Australia. The decline in 2019 revenue was further driven by scope reductions on a large power services project in the U.S. and lower volumes at the AMECO equipment business in Mexico.
56;Segment profit in 2019 decreased compared to 2018 primarily driven by the above mentioned reduced volumes in the operations and maintenance business, including higher margin specialty services, and the closure of the AMECO equipment business in Mexico. The decline in segment profit in 2019 was further driven by charges related to negotiations with clients and joint venture partners.
57;The declines in segment profit margin in 2020 and 2019 were primarily due to the same factors affecting segment profit.
58;The Radford and Warren projects continue to project losses as of December 31, 2020.Revenue in 2020 increased compared to 2019 due to increased execution activities for both the Radford and Warren projects.
59;Segment loss in 2018 of $56 million was driven by forecast revisions on the Radford project.
60;The increase in NuScale costs during 2020 was due to an increase in research and development activities as NuScale received final design certification by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission in August of 2020.
61;The decrease in other expense in 2020 was driven by the realization of our restructuring efforts and lower travel costs due to COVID-19.The increase in net interest expense during 2020 was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest income driven by lower interest rates in 2020.
62;The decrease in net interest expense during 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in interest income from time deposits in 2019 as well as a payment made in 2018 for a make-whole premium associated with the redemption of the 2021 Notes.
63;During the third quarter of 2019, we recognized impairment charges of $257 million related to certain investments and $34 million related to customer relationship intangible assets.
64;Revenues increased 17% for fiscal 2021, driven by growth in both the NIKE Brand and Converse.
65;Unit sales of footwear increased 11%, while higher average selling price (ASP), on a wholesale equivalent basis, per pair contributed approximately 7 percentage points of footwear revenue growth.

91;Demand creation expense decreased primarily due to lower advertising and marketing, as well as digital marketing expenses.
92;Currency-neutral footwear revenues increased 8% for fiscal 2021 due to higher revenues in several key categories, primarily the Jordan Brand and Sportswear.
93;Unit sales of footwear decreased 5%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 13 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven by higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs, in part reflecting inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory, which includes Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, as well as the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business.
94;Currency-neutral apparel revenues increased 10% for fiscal 2021 due to higher revenues in most key categories, led by Sportswear.
95;Reported EBIT increased 29% for fiscal 2021 driven by higher revenues, lower selling and administrative expense and gross margin expansion.

106;Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower operating overhead and demand creation expense.
107;Operating overhead expense decreased primarily due to lower bad debt, travel and related costs and other administrative costs.
108;Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated $6,612 million of operating cash inflow for fiscal 2021 compared to $3,730 million for fiscal 2020. The increase primarily reflects the recovery of our business operations from the impact of COVID-19.
109;The net change in working capital was impacted by a $2,361 million decrease in Inventories, driven by strong consumer demand as we return to healthy inventory levels across markets closed in the prior year due to COVID-19.
110;An increase in Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities also contributed to the net change in working capital, primarily due to reduced spending in fiscal 2020 as a result of COVID-19.
111;In addition, the net change in working capital was impacted by a $2,845 million increase in Accounts receivable, net, primarily driven by higher revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.
112;Cash provided (used) by investing activities was an outflow of $3,800 million for fiscal 2021, compared to an outflow of $1,028 million for fiscal 2020, primarily driven by higher purchases of short-term investments.
113;During fiscal 2021, the net change in investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash outflow of $3,276 million compared to a cash inflow of $27 million in fiscal 2020.
114;Cash provided (used) by financing activities was an outflow of $1,459 million for fiscal 2021 compared to an inflow of $2,491 million for fiscal 2020. This change was primarily due to the net proceeds from a $5,942 million corporate bond issuance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, partially offset by lower share repurchases during fiscal 2021.
115;.Liquidity was also provided by our $3 billion commercial paper program, which we decreased from $4 billion in connection with the new credit facility agreement, entered into on March 15, 2021, as described above.
116;To date, we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets however, future volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. As of May 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $13.5 billion, primarily consisting of commercial paper, corporate notes, deposits held at major banks, money market funds, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations, U.S. Treasury obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities.
117;The VaR increased year-over-year as a result of an increase in foreign currency volatilities as of May 31, 2021.
118;During the third quarter, sales improved substantially compared to the second quarter. This was driven by several factors, including an improvement in our merchandise assortments, a 25later back-to-school season, stronger performance in our larger markets, and our return to more normal store hours.
119;Our fourth quarter sales remained suppressed due to the negative impact from the upsurge in the virus that resulted in reduced customer traffic and more stringent occupancy and store operating hours restrictions.
120;In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we refinanced $775 million in aggregate principal amount of higher interest senior notes with the issuance of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of lower interest rate senior notes. This action resulted in a refinancing charge of approximately $240 million in the third quarter, but will significantly reduce our annual interest expense and total cash outlays over the life of the debt.
121;Sales for fiscal 2020 decreased $3.5 billion, or 21.9%, compared to the prior year. This was primarily due to the negative impact from store closures during the March 2020 to June 2020 period, the negative impact on customer demand from the COVID-19 pandemic, mandated occupancy restrictions, and reduced store operating hours during the remainder of fiscal 2020.
122;Cost of goods sold in fiscal 2020 decreased $1.7 billion compared to the prior year mainly due to the lower sales from the temporary closure of all store locations (starting on March 20, 2020 through a portion of the second quarter of fiscal 2020), and ensuing negative impact on customer demand from the COVID-19 pandemic after our store reopenings, as well as lower costs from the temporary furlough of most hourly associates in our distribution centers and some associates in our buying offices.
123;For fiscal 2019, SG&A increased $140.2 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 88 net new stores during the year.
124;SG&A as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2019 decreased by approximately 10 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to leverage on higher sales.28Interest expense (income), net.
125;In fiscal 2020, net interest expense increased by $101.5 million compared to 2019 primarily due to higher interest expense on long-term debt due to the issuance of Senior Notes in April 2020 and October 2020 (net of repurchase of Senior Notes), lower interest income due to lower interest rates, and higher interest expense on short-term debt due to the draw down on our $800 million revolving credit facility in March 2020 (which was subsequently repaid in October 2020), partially offset by higher capitalized interest primarily related to the construction of our Brookshire, Texas distribution center.
126;In fiscal 2019, we resolved uncertain tax positions with a state tax authority. As a result, we recognized a tax benefit of approximately $10.0 million in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
127;In fiscal 2018, we resolved uncertain tax positions related to fiscal 2015 with the Internal Revenue Service. As a result, we recognized a tax benefit of approximately $26.0 million in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law.
128;Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2020 were lower than in fiscal 2019, primarily due to higher cost of goods sold, higher SG&A expenses, and higher interest expense.
129;Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2019 were lower compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to higher cost of goods sold, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses and higher interest income.
130;Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020 was $0.24, compared to $4.60 in the prior year. The lower diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to lower sales due to the closing of all our store locations starting on March 20, 2020 through a portion the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and the negative impact on customer demand from the COVID-19 pandemic, higher markdowns to clear aged and seasonal inventory, long-term debt refinancing costs, payments to associates while our stores were closed (net of employee retention credits under the CARES Act), and higher expenditures for COVID-19 related measures.
131;Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2019 was $4.60, which included a per share benefit of approximately $0.02 primarily related to the favorable resolution of a tax matter, compared to $4.26 in the prior year, which included a per share benefit of approximately $0.07 from the favorable resolution of a tax matter.
132;In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we refinanced $775 million in aggregate principal amount of higher interest senior notes with the issuance of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of lower interest rate senior notes. This action resulted in a refinancing charge of approximately $240 million in the third quarter, but will significantly reduce our annual interest expense and total cash outlays over the life of the debt.
133;Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, and was primarily driven by net earnings excluding non-cash expenses for depreciation and amortization and for deferred taxes.
134;The increase in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by higher accounts payable leverage.
135;The increase in cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by higher earnings and the timing of merchandise receipts and related payments versus the prior year.
136;The increase in accounts payable leverage in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by lower packaway and in-store inventory and extended payment terms.
137;The increase in accounts payable leverage in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by timing of merchandise receipts and related payments versus the prior year.
138;The decrease in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to a reduction in our capital expenditures.
139;The increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in our capital expenditures.The decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to our actions to preserve our financial liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions.
140;The increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to investments in our distribution centers, and information technology infrastructure investments for our stores, buying, corporate offices, and transportation.
141;The increase in cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2020, compared to fiscal 2019, was primarily due to the completion of our public debt offerings, net of repurchase and refinancing costs, and the suspension of our share repurchases and dividends in the second quarter of 2020.
142;In October 2020, we repaid in full the $800 million we borrowed under the unsecured revolving credit facility. As a result, we currently have no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding under this facility, and the $800 million credit facility remains in place and available.
143;The modifications to Section 163(j) increase the allowable business interest deduction from 30% of adjusted taxable income to 50% of adjusted taxable income. This modification significantly increases the allowable interest expense deduction of the Company and resulted in significantly less taxable income for the year-ended 2019, resulting in less utilization of net operating losses and foreign tax credits in that year.
144;As a result of this analysis, we concluded that the fair value was less than the carrying amount for one of our indefinite-lived trade names and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $88 million within the Connect reporting unit. The impairment was primarily a result of change in market comparable data inputs utilized in establishing the discount rate, which resulted in a higher discount rate in the valuation, as well as slightly downward revisions of management’s forecasts of future revenues.
145;These insurance companies are now required to pay and administer the retirement benefits owed to these retirees and beneficiaries. These transactions have no impact on the amount, timing, or form of the monthly retirement benefit payments to the covered retirees and beneficiaries. These transactions resulted in a non-cash charge to other income/expense of $170 million in our consolidated statements of operations and did not impact cash flows in 2019.
146;The Company’s other long-lived asset impairment assessments resulted in the recognition of a non-cash impairment charge of $96 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
147;Costs within our Connect segment decreased 3.6%, or a decrease of 2.4% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to temporary actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our productivity initiatives and lower variable costs associated with lower revenues.
148;Costs within our Media segment increased 1.2%, or an increase of 1.3% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to the impact of our investments and higher spending on product portfolio management initiatives, partially offset by temporary actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and productivity initiatives.

151;Costs within our Corporate segment increased 157.8% on a reported and constant currency basis, primarily due to separation-related costs relating to the separation of our Global Connect business from our Global Media business.
152;Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense was $864 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $756 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization expense associated with more assets in use, partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization expense associated with tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations.
153;Interest Expense Interest expense was $371 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $397 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to slightly lower USD LIBOR interest rates on our senior secured term loans without hedged positions.
154;50 Income/(Loss) Before Income Taxes and Equity in Net Income of Affiliates Income was $74 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a loss of $663 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due primarily to the consolidated results mentioned above.
155;Our effective tax rate benefit of 91% for the year ended December 31, 2020 was higher than the UK statutory rate as a result of the impact of tax rate differences in other jurisdictions where the Company files tax returns, increases in valuation allowances, taxable transactions related to the separation, and withholding and foreign taxes as well as state and local income taxes offset by the favorable impact of changes in estimates for uncertain tax positions and audit settlements, research and development credits, and the effect of global licensing activities.
156;Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was higher than the UK statutory rate as a result of the impact of goodwill impairment, tax rate differences in other jurisdictions where the Company files tax returns, post-retirement settlements, and withholding and foreign taxes as well as state and local income taxes offset by the favorable impact of changes in estimates for uncertain tax positions and audit settlements, decreases in valuation allowances, the effect of global licensing activities, and certain financing activities.
