0001.00002; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements.; 0
0001.00003; Results of OperationsIn early 2020, we decided to retain our government business, which had been included in Disc Ops since the third quarter of 2019.; 0
0001.00004; As a result, the government business is no longer reported as a discontinued operation for any period presented.; 0
0001.00005; Our plan to sell the AMECO equipment business remains unchanged and it remains reported as a discontinued operation.; 0
0001.00006; We expect to complete the sale of the AMECO equipment business within the first half of 2021.; 0
0001.00007; The assets and liabilities of the AMECO business are classified as held for sale for all periods presented. In light of our decision to retain our government business in 2020, we had the following six reportable segments:◦Energy & Chemicals◦Mining & Industrial ◦Infrastructure & Power◦Government◦Diversified Services◦OtherBeginning in the first quarter of 2021, we will operate through three business segments: Energy Solutions, Urban Solutions and Mission Solutions.; 0
0001.00008; Energy Solutions will focus on energy transition, chemicals and traditional oil and gas opportunities.; 0
0001.00009; Urban Solutions will focus on mining, metals, advanced technologies, manufacturing, life sciences, infrastructure and our professional staffing services.; 0
0001.00010; Mission Solutions will focus on delivering solutions to federal agencies across the U.S. government and to select international opportunities.; 0
0001.00011; Additionally, we are initiating plans to sell Stork.; 0
0001.00012; During 2019, we approved and initiated a broad restructuring plan designed to optimize costs, improve operational efficiency and support long-term sustainable growth.; 0
0001.00013; These restructuring activities included the rationalization of resources, investments, real estate and overhead across various geographies.; 0
0001.00014; The negotiations and agreements resulting from these meetings, as well as project developments during the second quarter, resulted in the recognition of significant charges across three segments, which are reflected in the results for 2019.; 0
0001.00015; These events have created significant uncertainty and economic volatility and disruption, which have impacted and may continue to impact our business.; 0
0001.00016; We have experienced, and may continue to experience, reductions in demand for certain of our services and the delay or abandonment of ongoing or anticipated projects due to our clients’, suppliers’ and other third parties’ diminished financial condition or financial distress, as well as governmental budget constraints.; 0
0001.00017; Although we initially assessed our project estimates for COVID-19 during the first quarter of 2020, continued isolation of estimated COVID-19 effects became increasingly difficult to measure as 2020 progressed.; 0
0001.00018; Our estimates reflect our best assessment of project results inclusive of COVID-19 effects, which have been dynamic as our projects have seen changes in prevailing regulations as COVID cases crested and fell.; 0
0001.00019; These impacts may continue or worsen under prolonged stay-at-home, social distancing, travel restrictions and other similar orders or restrictions.; 0
0001.00020; Significant uncertainty still exists concerning the magnitude of the impact and duration of these events.; 0
0001.00021; Because of the foregoing matters, we performed interim impairment testing of our goodwill, intangible assets and investments.; 0
0001.00022; We also evaluated the impact of these events on our reserves for credit risk and the fair value of our assets held for sale.During 2020, we recognized the following significant charges:• $298 million for impairments of goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other assets• $60 million for current expected credit losses associated with Energy & Chemicals clients• $146 million for impairments of assets held for sale (included in Disc Ops), of which $12 million related to goodwill as well as• Significant forecast revisions for project positions due to COVID-19 related schedule delays and associated cost growth.During 2019, we recognized charges (related to cumulative catch up adjustments and loss projects) totaling $839 million in the Energy & Chemicals, Infrastructure & Power and Other segments.; 0
0001.00023; We also recognized $533 million related to impairments, restructuring and other exit costs.; 0
0001.00024; Additionally, we settled the remaining obligations associated with our defined benefit pension plan in the United Kingdom and recognized a loss on pension settlement of $138 million during 2019.; 0
0001.00025; During 2018, we recognized charges totaling $417 million related to projects in the Energy & Chemicals, Infrastructure & Power and Other segments.; 1
0001.00026; These project charges were partially offset by a gain of $125 million from the sale of a joint venture interest in the United Kingdom.; 1
0001.00027; Earnings in 2018 also benefitted from the adoption of ASC 606 which increased earnings before taxes by $132 million, primarily in the Energy & Chemicals segment.; 0
0001.00028; During 2020, consolidated revenue declined primarily due to volume declines on Energy & Chemicals and Mining & Industrial projects, many of which were completed or nearing completion. The revenue decline in 2020 was further compounded by COVID-19 and the decline in oil prices.; 1
0001.00029; For example, a large mining project was suspended for six months due to COVID-19 and the volume of work in the Diversified Services segment significantly declined as turnaround work was delayed and maintenance scopes reduced.; 0
0001.00030; During 2019, consolidated revenue declined primarily due to volume declines on Energy & Chemicals projects as well as the completion of a power restoration project in Puerto Rico in 2018 and three large power projects in 2019.During 2020, total segment profit increased due to the project charges in the Energy & Chemicals, Infrastructure & Power and Other segments recognized in 2019 (discussed above).; 1
0001.00031; During 2019, total segment profit significantly declined due to the 2019 project charges in the Energy & Chemicals, Infrastructure & Power and Other segments.The effective tax rate from continuing operations was (9.0%), (45.3%) and 44.9% for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.; 1
0001.00032; The 2020 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by a $125 million benefit due to the utilization of a 2019 net operating loss carryback as allowed under the CARES ACT enacted on March 27, 2020.; 1
0001.00033; This benefit was offset by a $149 million increase in valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets primarily in the U.S. and the Netherlands.; 1
0001.00034; The 2019 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by $731 million in charges related to establishing valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia.; 1
0001.00035; The 2018 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted due to a $79 million increase in valuation allowances to reduce certain deferred tax assets in the U.S., the Netherlands and Belgium.; 1
0001.00036; Our results reported by foreign subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are affected by foreign currency volatility.; 0
0001.00037; When the U.S. dollar appreciates against the non-U.S. dollar functional currencies of these subsidiaries, our reported revenue, cost and earnings, after translation into U.S. dollars, are lower than what they would have been had the U.S. dollar depreciated against the same foreign currencies or if there had been no change in the exchange rates.Our margins, in some cases, may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by a change in the amount of materials and customer-furnished materials, which are accounted for as pass-through costs.; 0
0001.00038; The lack of broad based new awards could continue to put pressure on our future earnings streams, particularly in the Energy & Chemicals segment.; 0
0001.00039; Backlog included $1.8 billion for projects in a loss position as of December 31, 2020.; 0
0001.00040; The decline in backlog during 2020 and 2019 primarily resulted from new award activity being outpaced by work performed.; 0
0001.00041; During 2019, certain suspended contracts associated with our joint venture in Mexico were removed from backlog.; 0
0001.00042; Although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm, cancellations, deferrals or scope adjustments may occur.; 0
0001.00043; Backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, revisions to project scope and cost, foreign currency exchange fluctuations and project deferrals, as appropriate. Backlog differs from RUPO discussed elsewhere.; 0
0001.00044; Backlog includes the amount of revenue we expect to recognize under ongoing operations and maintenance contracts for the remainder of the current year renewal period plus up to three additional years if renewal is considered to be probable, while RUPO includes only the amount of revenue we expect to recognize under ongoing operations and maintenance contracts with definite terms and substantive termination provisions.; 0
0001.00045; Impairment, Restructuring and Other Exit CostsDuring 2019, we initiated a restructuring plan designed to optimize costs and improve operational efficiency.; 0
0001.00046; These efforts primarily relate to the rationalization of resources, investments, real estate and overhead across various geographies, as well as the liquidation of certain components of the AMECO business that are being excluded from sale.; 0
0001.00047; Our planned restructuring activities were substantially completed by the end of 2020.; 0
0001.00048; Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, we expect Stork will be reported as a discontinued operation and the assets and liabilities of Stork will be classified as held for sale.; 0
0001.00049; Once classified as available for sale, Stork's assets will be subjected to a quarterly recoverability analysis.Segment OperationsWe provide professional services in the fields of engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication and modularization, operations, maintenance and asset integrity, as well as project management services, on a global basis and serve a diverse set of industries worldwide.; 0
0001.00050; We consider charges to include effects that negatively impact a project's gross margin, including negative adjustments to revenue and recognition of project losses.Energy & ChemicalsRevenue in 2020 decreased compared to 2019 due to significant declines in the volume of execution activities for numerous upstream, downstream and chemicals projects nearing completion, partially offset by increased execution activity for an LNG project in Canada.; 0
0001.00051; Revenue in 2019 decreased compared to 2018 due to a significant decline in the volume of customer-furnished materials and project execution activities, combined with the impact of a lower volume of broad based new awards.; 1
0001.00052; The revenue decline in 2019 was also partially offset by increased execution activity for the LNG project.; 0
0001.00053; Segment profit significantly increased during 2020 despite the adverse impacts of the recognition of reserves totaling $60 million for expected credit losses associated with certain joint venture clients, as well as margin diminution on a percentage-of-completion basis resulting from project positions taken with respect to COVID-19 related schedule delays and associated cost growth. The increase in segment profit during 2020 is primarily the result of charges taken during 2019, discussed below.; 1
0001.00054; Excluding these items, segment profit declined in 2020 due to the reduced execution activity of the upstream, downstream and chemicals projects discussed above, partially offset by the increase in activity for the LNG project and a decrease in overhead.Segment profit in 2019 significantly decreased compared to 2018 as a result of charges taken during 2019 including $260 million for cost growth on an offshore project, $87 million for cost growth on two downstream projects and scope reductions on a large upstream project, $26 million for the write-off of pre-contract costs, $26 million on embedded foreign currency derivatives and $31 million from the resolution of close-out matters.; 1
0001.00055; Segment profit in 2018 was adversely impacted by charges of $133 million for cost growth on a completed, downstream project and $40 million for cost growth on the aforementioned offshore project.The changes in segment profit margin in 2020 and 2019 were primarily attributable to the same factors that affected revenue and segment profit.; 1
0001.00056; Segment profit margin in 2020 was also adversely impacted by a shift from higher margin work in 2019 to lower margin work in 2020 in certain geographies.No significant awards were booked in 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19 and declining oil prices on our customers' capital spend.; 1
0001.00057; New awards in 2019 included a downstream project in the United Kingdom as well as chemicals projects in China, India and on the U.S. gulf coast.; 0
0001.00058; New awards in 2018 included an LNG export facility in Canada as well as an engineering and procurement contract for a refinery in Texas.The decline in backlog during 2020 resulted from the decline in new award activity and the de-recognition of a suspended downstream project.; 0
0001.00059; The decrease in backlog during 2019 resulted primarily from new award activity being outpaced by work performed as well as the removal of certain contracts associated with our joint venture in Mexico that were suspended during 2019.; 0
0001.00060; These revenue declines were partially offset by increased execution activities on two advanced technologies projects as well as a mining project and a metals project, both in North America.; 0
0001.00061; Revenue increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to increased execution activities for several large mining projects as well as ramping up construction activity on the two advanced technologies projects.; 1
0001.00062; Segment profit declined in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a gain of $31 million recognized in 2019 resulting from a favorable resolution of a longstanding customer dispute on a mining project.; 1
0001.00063; Segment profit in 2020 was also adversely impacted by the decline in activity for the life sciences project and mining projects nearing completion as well as the mining project in South America that was impacted by COVID-19.; 1
0001.00064; The decrease in segment profit in 2020 was partially offset by a reduction in overhead expenses.; 0
0001.00065; Segment profit in 2019 increased compared to 2018 due to the increased volume of execution activities for the large mining projects and the two advanced technologies projects that drove the increase in revenue as well as the favorable resolution of the customer dispute.; 1
0001.00066; The decline in segment profit margin in 2020 and the increase in segment profit margin in 2019 was primarily the result of the favorable resolution of the customer dispute in 2019.; 1
0001.00067; New awards in 2020 included a significant North American steel project as well as several front-end studies that we believe positions the segment well for follow-on EPC awards.; 0
0001.00068; New awards in 2019 included an advanced manufacturing project in the Netherlands.; 0
0001.00069; New awards in 2018 included a copper project in Peru, an iron ore replacement mine in Australia and a mine expansion project in Peru.; 0
0001.00070; The decrease in backlog during 2020 and 2019 primarily resulted from work performed outpacing new award activity.We expect our mining business line to benefit from the growing global demand for copper and our advanced technologies and life sciences business line to benefit from the increasing demand for data storage facilities and biological facilities.; 0
0001.00071; Infrastructure & PowerRevenue in 2020 increased compared to 2019 primarily driven by an increase in execution activities for several infrastructure projects, including a year-over-year increase on a rail project which was canceled in the third quarter of 2020.; 0
0001.00072; The increase in revenue during 2020 was partially offset by a decrease in execution activities for several infrastructure projects nearing completion.; 0
0001.00073; Revenue in 2019 decreased compared to 2018 primarily due to the substantial completion of the three large power projects during 2019.; 1
0001.00074; This decline was partially offset by increased project execution activities on several infrastructure projects. Revenue also reflects the adverse impact of various forecast revisions discussed below.; 0
0001.00075; Segment profit in 2020 significantly improved compared to 2019 primarily due to forecast revisions on several power and infrastructure projects recognized in 2019 (discussed below).; 1
0001.00076; A positive settlement on a canceled rail project in 2020 was offset by charges for cost growth in the infrastructure legacy portfolio.; 0
0001.00077; Segment profit in 2019 significantly decreased compared to 2018 due to charges of $135 million for the settlement of client disputes and cost growth on certain close-out matters for the three power projects discussed above and $133 million resulting from late engineering changes, schedule-driven cost growth and negotiations with clients and subcontractors on pending change orders for several infrastructure projects.; 1
0001.00078; Segment profit in 2018 included $188 million in charges on one of the aforementioned power projects as a result of cost growth and a $125 million gain associated with the sale of a joint venture interest in the United Kingdom.; 1
0001.00079; The changes in segment profit margin in 2020 and 2019 were primarily attributable to the same factors impacting segment profit in those years.; 1
0001.00080; Lower margin contributions from certain infrastructure projects for which charges were recognized during 2020 and 2019 may continue to adversely impact near term segment profit margin.; 0
0001.00081; We expect approximately 35% of the segment's revenue in 2021 will be generated from zero margin projects as of December 31, 2020.New awards in 2020 included a highway project in Texas.; 0
0001.00082; New awards in 2019 included a road project in Texas and a rail project in Chicago.; 0
0001.00083; New awards in 2018 included an international bridge project and the LAX Automated People Mover project.; 0
0001.00084; The decrease in backlog during 2020 was primarily due to a decline in new award activity in part driven by more selectivity in pursuing projects as well as delayed procurements.; 0
0001.00085; The decrease in backlog during 2019 was primarily due to work performed and project cancellations outpacing new award activity. Backlog included $1.5 billion for projects in a loss position as of December 31, 2020.We believe our infrastructure business is well positioned for select opportunities in the U.S. due to urbanization and an aging infrastructure system.; 0
0001.00086; These opportunities may be enhanced with the introduction of a federal infrastructure spending bill.38Table of ContentsGovernmentRevenue in 2020 decreased compared to 2019 primarily due to the completion of a nuclear decommissioning project in 2019 as well a decline in work performed for FEMA.; 0
0001.00087; The decrease in 2020 revenue was further driven by the recognition of service fee revenue in 2019 upon the favorable settlement of project claims on two cancelled nuclear power projects in the U.S.; 1
0001.00088; The decline in revenue in 2020 was partially offset by increased project execution activities at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as well as our DOE sites.; 0
0001.00089; Revenue in 2019 decreased compared to 2018 substantially driven by the completion of a power restoration project in Puerto Rico in 2018 as well as a decrease in project execution activities for a logistics assistance program in Afghanistan, partially offset by an increase in execution activities at the Savannah River DOE site and the favorable settlement of the two nuclear power plant projects in 2019.The decrease in segment profit in 2020 was substantially driven by the favorable settlement of the two nuclear power plant projects in 2019 as well as the completion of the nuclear decommissioning project in 2019 and the decline in FEMA work in 2020.; 1
0001.00090; Segment profit in 2020 was also adversely impacted by COVID-19, particularly as it relates to estimated fee recoveries on certain projects.; 0
0001.00091; The increase in segment profit in 2019 was due to the favorable settlement of the two nuclear power plant projects.; 1
0001.00092; The changes in segment profit margin in 2020 and 2019 were primarily attributable to the same factors that affected revenue and segment profit.; 1
0001.00093; New awards in 2020, 2019 and 2018 included one-year extensions of the logistics assistance contract in Afghanistan and the Savannah River environmental management contract.; 0
0001.00094; New awards in 2018 also included a five-year extension of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve contract and a thirty-month extension at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant site.The decline in backlog during 2020 and 2019 resulted from new award activity being outpaced by work performed.; 0
0001.00095; Backlog included $1.0 billion and $1.9 billion of unfunded government contracts as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.Diversified ServicesAs discussed elsewhere, most of the operating results of our AMECO equipment business are included in Disc Ops.; 0
0001.00096; The retained portion of the AMECO operations have been or are in the process of being liquidated but do not meet the qualifications of Disc Ops.; 0
0001.00097; These retained operations remain in the Diversified Services segment.Revenue in 2020 decreased compared to 2019 primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and declining oil prices resulting in lower volumes in the Stork business and the staffing business as turnaround work is delayed and maintenance scopes reduced. Revenue declines in 2020 were further driven by reduced volume from the winding down of our AMECO operations in Mexico.; 1
0001.00098; Revenue in 2019 decreased compared to 2018 primarily due to lower volumes in the Stork business in Europe, the cancellation of a large operations and maintenance project in North America in 2018 and scope reductions on a maintenance project in Australia. The decline in 2019 revenue was further driven by scope reductions on a large power services project in the U.S. and lower volumes at the AMECO equipment business in Mexico.; 1
0001.00099; The revenue declines in 2019 were partially offset by higher contributions from the staffing business in North America and Europe.Segment profit in 2020 remained flat compared to 2019.; 0
0001.00100; The lower volumes in the Stork business and the staffing business were offset by a reduction in expenses related to close out activities at our AMECO operations in Mexico as well as a reduction in overhead costs.; 0
0001.00101; Segment profit in 2019 decreased compared to 2018 primarily driven by the above mentioned reduced volumes in the operations and maintenance business, including higher margin specialty services, and the closure of the AMECO equipment business in Mexico. The decline in segment profit in 2019 was further driven by charges related to negotiations with clients and joint venture partners.; 1
0001.00102; The declines in segment profit margin in 2020 and 2019 were primarily due to the same factors affecting segment profit.The decrease in backlog during 2020 was primarily due to the postponement of new maintenance work due to COVID-19 and the decline in oil prices.; 1
0001.00103; The increase in backlog during 2019 was primarily due to a large award for the power services business.; 0
0001.00104; Our equipment and staffing businesses do not report backlog or new awards. OtherOther includes the operations of NuScale, as well as two lump-sum projects including a plant for which we serve as a subcontractor to a commercial client (the Radford project) and a weapons storage and maintenance facility (the Warren project).; 0
0001.00105; The Radford and Warren projects continue to project losses as of December 31, 2020.Revenue in 2020 increased compared to 2019 due to increased execution activities for both the Radford and Warren projects.; 1
0001.00106; Forecast revisions in 2019 resulted in charges of $59 million on the Warren project and $83 million on the Radford project for various engineering and cost growth associated with the facilities.; 0
0001.00107; Segment loss in 2018 of $56 million was driven by forecast revisions on the Radford project.; 1
0001.00108; Our forecast for both projects is based upon our assessment of the probable cost to finish the projects as well as our assessment of the recovery of unapproved change orders.; 0
0001.00109; The Radford project is substantially complete with systems turnover to the client expected in the first quarter of 2021.; 0
0001.00110; NuScale expenses, net of qualified reimbursable expenses, included in the determination of segment loss, were $84 million, $66 million and $74 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.; 0
0001.00111; The increase in NuScale costs during 2020 was due to an increase in research and development activities as NuScale received final design certification by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission in August of 2020.; 1
0001.00112; Capital contributions by NuScale's NCI holders of $9 million, $49 million and $2 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, reduced the need for additional funding from Fluor.Corporate and Other MattersYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31(in millions)202020192018Corporate G&ACompensation$121.7 $87.1 $115.3 Foreign currency (gains) losses46.8 26.5 (33.4)Legal and accounting fees associated with the 2020 internal review42.0 — — Other30.2 52.3 39.3 Corporate G&A$240.7 $165.9 $121.2 The increase in compensation expense in 2020 was primarily due to higher stock price driven compensation, as our stock price increased from the date of grant to the end of the year. The decrease in compensation expense in 2019 was primarily due to lower stock price and performance driven compensation.; 0
0001.00113; During 2020 and 2019, most major foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar resulting in foreign currency exchange losses.; 0
0001.00114; In 2018, most major foreign currencies weakened against the U.S. dollar resulting in foreign currency exchange gains.; 0
0001.00115; The decrease in other expense in 2020 was driven by the realization of our restructuring efforts and lower travel costs due to COVID-19.The increase in net interest expense during 2020 was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest income driven by lower interest rates in 2020.; 1
0001.00116; The decrease in net interest expense during 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in interest income from time deposits in 2019 as well as a payment made in 2018 for a make-whole premium associated with the redemption of the 2021 Notes.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.; 1
0001.00117; Our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our financial statements.; 0
0001.00118; The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.; 0
0001.00119; Estimates are based on information available through the date of the issuance of the financial statements and, accordingly, actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates.; 0
0001.00120; Significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements apply to the following critical accounting policies:Revenue Recognition for Long-Term Contracts.; 0
0001.00121; We recognize our engineering and construction contract revenue over time as we provide services to satisfy our performance obligations. We generally use the cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion measure of progress as it best depicts how control transfers to our clients.; 0
0001.00122; The cost-to-cost approach measures progress towards completion based on the ratio of contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost.; 0
0001.00123; Use of the cost-to-cost measure of progress requires us to prepare estimates of total expected revenue and cost to complete our projects.; 0
0001.00124; Our contracts with our customers may contain award fees, incentive fees, liquidated damages or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the contract price to arrive at estimated revenue. These variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets and can be based upon customer discretion.; 0
0001.00125; We estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled.; 0
0001.00126; We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable we will realize that amount.; 0
0001.00127; Our estimates of variable consideration and our determination of its inclusion in project revenue for accounting purposes are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance and other information that may be available to us.; 0
0001.00128; At a project level, we have specific practices and procedures to review our estimate of total revenue and cost.; 0
0001.00129; Each project team reviews the progress and execution of our performance obligations, which impact the project’s accounting outcome.; 0
0001.00130; As part of this process, the project team reviews information such as any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule and identified risks and opportunities.; 0
0001.00131; The accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period depends on the accuracy of our project estimates, which can change from period to period for factors such as:•Complexity in original design•Extent of changes from original design•Different site conditions than assumed in our bid•The productivity, availability and skill level of labor•Weather conditions when executing a project•The technical maturity of the technologies involved•Length of time to complete the project•Availability and cost of equipment and materials•Subcontractor and joint venture partner performance•Expected costs of warranties and•Our ability to recover for additional contract costs.We recognize changes in contract estimates on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the changes are identified.; 0
0001.00132; Such changes in contract estimates can result in the recognition of revenue in a current period for performance obligations which were satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods.; 0
0001.00133; Changes in contract estimates may also result in the reversal of previously recognized revenue if the current estimate adversely differs from the previous estimate.; 0
0001.00134; If we estimate that a project will have costs in excess of revenue, we recognize the total loss in the period it is identified.Variable Consideration. The nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including claims, unpriced change orders, award and incentive fees, liquidated damages and penalties.; 0
0001.00135; We consider variable consideration in the development of our project forecasts so that our forecasted revenue reflects the amount of consideration we expect to be probable of recovering without a future significant reversal.; 0
0001.00136; We estimate the amount of revenue attributable to variable consideration using the expected value method (i.e., the sum of probability-weighted amounts) or the most likely amount method, whichever offers better prediction. Significant judgments are required in developing estimates for variable consideration.; 0
0001.00137; Fair Value Measurements.; 0
0001.00138; We are often required to use fair value measurement techniques with inputs that require the use of estimates and involve significant judgment.; 0
0001.00139; These circumstances include:•Goodwill impairment testing of reporting units when quantitative analysis is deemed necessary•Impairment testing of intangible assets when impairment indicators are present•Impairment testing of investments as part of other than temporary impairment assessments when impairment indicators are present•Fair value assessments of businesses held for sale that are reported at fair value less cost to sell•Purchase price allocations for acquired businessesWhen performing quantitative fair value or impairment evaluations, we estimate the fair value of our assets by considering the results of either or both income-based and market-based valuation approaches.; 0
0001.00140; Under the income approach, we prepare a discounted cash flow valuation model using recent forecasts and compare the estimated fair value of each asset to its carrying value.; 0
0001.00141; Cash flow forecasts are discounted using the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital at the date of evaluation.; 0
0001.00142; The weighted-average cost of capital is comprised of the cost of equity and the cost of debt with a weighting for each that reflects our current capital structure.; 0
0001.00143; Preparation of long-term forecasts involve significant judgments involving consideration of our backlog, expected future awards, customer attrition, working capital assumptions, and general market trends and conditions.; 0
0001.00144; Significant changes in these forecasts or any valuation assumptions, such as the discount rate selected, could affect the estimated fair value of our assets and could result in impairment expenses.; 0
0001.00145; All other factors being equal, a one hundred basis point change in the discount rates used in these valuations would change the fair value of these assets by $47 million, $2 million and $3 million, respectively.; 0
0001.00146; During the third quarter of 2019, we performed quantitative testing of our goodwill, intangibles and other investments.; 0
0001.00147; The majority of our goodwill resides in our Diversified Services reporting unit. Based on the testing performed, the fair value of the Diversified Services reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill, by 20%.; 0
0001.00148; All other factors being equal, a one hundred basis point increase in the discount rate used in the valuation would have resulted in its fair value exceeding its carrying value by 7%.; 0
0001.00149; During the third quarter of 2019, we recognized impairment charges of $257 million related to certain investments and $34 million related to customer relationship intangible assets.; 1
0001.00150; All other factors being equal, a one hundred basis point change in the discount rates used in these valuations would have affected these impairments by $20 million and $4 million, respectively.; 0
0001.00151; Restructuring Accruals.; 0
0001.00152; We recognize and accrue restructuring related termination benefits when the recognition criteria under GAAP have been met, depending on the nature of the termination benefit.; 0
0001.00153; Recognition of termination benefits requires the use of estimates in determining the expected termination benefits payable, when they are probable of being realized and can be reasonably estimated. Our estimates consider the number of employees that we expect will be eligible to receive the benefit and the amount of benefit potentially payable to each employee based on either the terms of the plan or statutory entitlement.Recent Accounting PronouncementsItem is described more fully in the Notes to Financial Statements.Litigation and Matters in Dispute ResolutionItem is described more fully in the Notes to Financial Statements.LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONOur liquidity is provided by available cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, capacity under our credit facility and, when necessary, access to the capital markets.; 0
0001.00154; We have both committed and uncommitted lines of credit available for revolving loans and letters of credit. We believe that for at least the next 12 months, cash generated from operations, along with our unused credit capacity and cash position, is sufficient to support operating requirements.; 0
0001.00155; However, we regularly review our sources and uses of liquidity and may pursue opportunities to increase our liquidity position.; 0
0001.00156; In February 2021, we entered into an amended and restated $1.65 billion credit facility which matures in February 2023 and replaces the now terminated $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion Revolving Loan and Letter of Credit Facilities.; 0
0001.00157; The amended credit facility contains customary financial and restrictive covenants, including a debt-to-capitalization ratio that cannot exceed 0.65 to 1.00, a limitation on the aggregate amount of debt of the greater of $750 million or €750 million for our subsidiaries, and a minimum liquidity threshold, as defined in the amended credit facility, of $1.5 billion which may be reduced to $1.25 billion upon the repayment of debt.; 0
0001.00158; If the amended credit facility had been in place as of December 31, 2020, our financial covenants would have limited our further borrowings to approximately $934 million.; 0
0001.00159; If there are future losses, the amount of available credit capacity under our committed facility may be further reduced.As of December 31, 2020, letters of credit totaling $418 million were outstanding under our predecessor lines of credit.; 0
0001.00160; There were no borrowings outstanding under these facilities as of December 31, 2020.; 0
0001.00161; These credit facilities also contained customary financial and restrictive covenants, including a debt-to-capitalization ratio that could not exceed 0.6 to 1.0.; 0
0001.00162; Cash and cash equivalents combined with marketable securities were $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2020 and $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2019.; 0
0001.00163; Cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous accounts throughout the world to fund our global project execution activities.; 0
0001.00164; Non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents amounted to $984 million and $944 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.; 0
0001.00165; These amounts (which totaled $655 million and $393 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively) were not necessarily readily available for general purposes.; 0
0001.00166; We also consider the extent to which client advances (which totaled $125 million and $69 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively) are likely to be sustained or consumed over the near term for project execution activities and the cash flow requirements of our various foreign operations. In some cases, it may not be financially efficient to move cash and cash equivalents between countries due to statutory dividend limitations and/or adverse tax consequences.; 0
0001.00167; We did not consider any cash to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, other than unremitted earnings required to meet our working capital and long-term investment needs in non-U.S. foreign jurisdictions where we operate. Working capital levels vary from period to period and are primarily affected by our volume of work and the billing schedules on our projects.; 0
0001.00168; These levels are also impacted by the stage of completion and commercial terms of engineering and construction projects, as well as our execution of our projects compared to their budget.; 0
0001.00169; Working capital requirements also vary by project and the payments terms agreed to with our clients, vendors and subcontractors.; 0
0001.00170; Most contracts require payments as the projects progress.; 0
0001.00171; Additionally, certain projects receive advance payments from clients. A typical trend for our projects is to have higher cash balances during the initial phases of execution due to deposits paid to us which then diminish toward the end of the construction phase.; 0
0001.00172; As a result, our cash position is reduced as customer advances are utilized, unless they are replaced by advances on other projects. We maintain cash reserves and borrowing facilities to provide additional working capital in the event that a project’s net operating cash outflows exceed its available cash balances.; 0
0001.00173; Specific factors related to the change in working capital include:•Decreases in accounts receivable which resulted from normal billing and collections for several projects in the Infrastructure & Power, Government and Diversified Services segments.•Decreases in contract assets which resulted from normal project execution activities for several projects in the Energy & Chemicals, Mining & Industrial, and Diversified Services segments.During 2019, working capital significantly decreased.; 0
0001.00174; Specific factors related to the change in working capital include:•Decreases in accounts receivable which resulted primarily from normal billing and collections for several projects in the Mining & Industrial segment as well as the LOGCAP IV program in Afghanistan.•Decreases in contract assets which resulted primarily from normal project execution activities for several projects in the Energy & Chemicals, Infrastructure & Power and Government segments.Excluding the non-cash impact of adopting ASC 606, working capital increased during 2018.; 0
0001.00175; Specific factors related to the change in working capital include:•Increases in contract assets which resulted primarily from normal project execution activities on a large mining project and several infrastructure projects, partially offset by decreases in contract assets on several Energy & Chemicals projects.•A decrease in contract liabilities in the Energy & Chemicals segment, which resulted primarily from normal project execution activities on several large projects.•An increase in accounts payable in the Mining & Industrial segment, which resulted from normal invoicing activities on a large mining project.•A decrease in other current assets, driven primarily by the receipt of income tax refunds in 2018.The decrease in operating cash flow in 2020 and the increase in operating cash flow in 2019 resulted primarily from changes in working capital balances.During the fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into a settlement agreement with a client in connection with a dispute over client-imposed delays and cost overruns on a cancelled rail project in Maryland. We received an initial settlement payment of $116 million in December 2020 and we are contractually owed an additional $150 million to be paid no later than December 2021.; 1
0001.00176; During 2020, we paid approximately $40 million in legal and accounting fees associated with the internal review that was completed in December 2020.We contributed $130 million, $115 million and $150 million into our DC plans during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $25 million, $15 million and $45 million into our DB plans during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.; 0
0001.00177; We expect to contribute up to $12 million to our DB plans in 2021, which is expected to be in excess of the minimum funding required.; 0
0001.00178; All periods included the operations of NuScale, which are primarily for research and development activities associated with the licensing and commercialization of small modular nuclear reactor technology.; 0
0001.00179; NuScale expenses included in the determination of segment profit were $84 million, $66 million and $74 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.; 0
0001.00180; NuScale expenses for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were reported net of qualified reimbursable expenses of $71 million, $56 million and $62 million, respectively.; 0
0001.00181; Capital contributions by NuScale's NCI holders of $9 million, $49 million and $2 million during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, reduced the need for additional funding from Fluor.Investing ActivitiesWe hold cash in bank deposits and marketable securities which are governed by our investment policy.; 0
0001.00182; This policy focuses on, in order of priority, the preservation of capital, maintenance of liquidity and maximization of yield.; 0
0001.00183; These investments may include money market funds, bank deposits placed with highly-rated financial institutions, repurchase agreements that are fully collateralized by U.S. Government-related securities, high-grade commercial paper and high quality short-term and medium-term fixed income securities.; 0
0001.00184; Proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment are primarily related to the disposal of construction equipment associated with the equipment business in Disc Ops.During 2020, we sold substantially all of the assets of our AMECO equipment business in Jamaica as well as 100% of our interest in an equipment rental business in Europe.; 0
0001.00185; The operations of the AMECO business in Jamaica were included in Disc Ops through the date of sale.; 0
0001.00186; Also in 2020, we sold our interests in two infrastructure joint ventures in the Netherlands that are currently in the operations and maintenance phase of the contract and one infrastructure joint venture in the U.S.; 0
0001.00187; In 2018, we sold our interest in a joint venture in the United Kingdom.; 0
0001.00188; Investments in unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures in 2020 and 2019 included capital contributions to two infrastructure joint ventures in the United States.; 0
0001.00189; Investments in 2018 included capital contributions to an infrastructure joint venture in the United States as well as investments in COOEC Fluor.; 0
0001.00190; We completed our final funding commitment to COOEC Fluor of $26 million during 2021. Financing ActivitiesWe have a common stock repurchase program, authorized by the Board of Directors, to purchase shares in the open market or privately negotiated transactions at our discretion. In 2018, we repurchased 1,097,126 shares of common stock under our current and previously authorized stock repurchase programs.; 0
0001.00191; As of December 31, 2020, 10,513,093 shares could still be purchased under the existing stock repurchase program.Quarterly cash dividends were typically paid during the month following the quarter in which they were declared.Therefore, dividends declared in the fourth quarter of 2019 were paid in the first quarter of 2020.; 0
0001.00192; Quarterly cash dividends of$0.21 per share were declared in 2018 and in the first, second and third quarters of 2019.; 0
0001.00193; Quarterly cash dividendsof $0.10 per share were declared in the fourth quarter of 2019.; 0
0001.00194; We suspended our dividend during April 2020.; 0
0001.00195; Thepayment and level of future cash dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors.In August 2018, we issued $600 million of 4.250% Senior Notes (the “2028 Notes”) due September 15, 2028 and received proceeds of $595 million, net of underwriting discounts.; 0
0001.00196; Interest on the 2028 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2019.; 0
0001.00197; In September 2018, we used a portion of the proceeds from the 2028 Notes to fully redeem our $500 million 3.375%Senior Notes (the “2021 Notes”) due September 15, 2021.; 0
0001.00198; The redemption price of $503 million was equal to 100 percent ofthe principal amount of the 2011 Notes plus a “make-whole” premium of $3 million.; 0
0001.00199; Other borrowings represent short-term bank loans and other financing arrangements associated with Stork.; 0
0001.00200; During the second and third quarters of 2018, we issued commercial paper to meet our short-term liquidity needs.; 0
0001.00201; All of the outstanding commercial paper was repaid in October 2018.Distributions paid to holders of NCI represent cash outflows to partners of consolidated partnerships or joint ventures created primarily for the execution of single contracts or projects.; 0
0001.00202; Distributions in 2020 and 2019 primarily related to a mining joint venture project in Chile.; 0
0001.00203; Distributions in 2018 primarily related to transportation joint venture projects in the United States. Capital contributions by NCI in 2020 related to three infrastructure joint ventures in the United States.; 0
0001.00204; Capital contributions by NCI in 2019 primarily related to initial investments from new partners in NuScale.Effect of Exchange Rate Changes on Cash During 2019, most major foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar resulting in unrealized translation gains of $101 million of which $10 million related to cash held by foreign subsidiaries.; 0
0001.00205; During 2018, most major foreign currencies weakened against the U.S. dollar resulting in unrealized translation losses of $117 million of which $62 million related to cash held by foreign subsidiaries.; 0
0001.00206; The cash held in foreign currencies will primarily be used for project-related expenditures in those currencies, and therefore our exposure to exchange gains and losses is generally mitigated.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsLetters of CreditAs of December 31, 2020, letters of credit totaling $418 million were outstanding under committed lines of credit and letters of credit totaling $862 million were outstanding under uncommitted lines of credit.; 0
0001.00207; Letters of credit are provided in the ordinary course of business primarily to indemnify our clients if we fail to perform our obligations under our contracts.; 0
0001.00208; These agreements are entered into primarily to support project execution commitments.; 0
0001.00209; The performance guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from mechanical completion of the project to a period extending beyond contract completion.; 0
0001.00210; The maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under outstanding performance guarantees, which represents the remaining cost of work to be performed, was estimated to be $14 billion as of December 31, 2020. Amounts that may be required to be paid in excess of estimated cost to complete contracts in progress are not estimable.; 0
0001.00211; For cost reimbursable contracts, amounts that may become payable pursuant to guarantee provisions are normally recoverable from the client for work performed.; 0
0001.00212; For lump-sum contracts, the performance guarantee amount is the cost to complete the contracted work, less amounts remaining to be billed to the client under the contract.; 0
0001.00213; Remaining billable amounts could be greater or less than the cost to complete.; 0
0001.00214; In those cases where costs exceed the remaining amounts payable under the contract, we may have recourse to third parties, such as owners, co-venturers, subcontractors or vendors for claims.; 0
0001.00215; The performance guarantee obligation was not material as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.Financial guarantees, made in the ordinary course of business in certain limited circumstances, are entered into with financial institutions and other credit grantors and generally obligate us to make payment in the event of a default by the borrower.; 0
0001.00216; These arrangements generally require the borrower to pledge collateral to support the fulfillment of the borrower’s obligation.InflationAlthough inflation and cost trends affect our results, we mitigate these trends by seeking to fix our cost at or soon after the time of award on lump-sum or fixed-price contracts or to recover cost increases in cost reimbursable contracts.Variable Interest EntitiesWe frequently form joint ventures or partnerships with others primarily for the execution of single contracts or projects.; 0
0001.00217; We assess our joint ventures and partnerships at inception to determine if any meet the qualifications of a VIE as defined in GAAP.; 0
0001.00218; If a joint venture or partnership is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary, the joint venture or partnership is consolidated and our partners' interests are recognized as NCI.; 0
0001.00219; Additional discussion of our VIEs may be found in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Item 7A.; 0
0001.00220; Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskCash and marketable securities are deposited with major banks throughout the world.; 0
0001.00221; Such deposits are placed with high quality institutions and the amounts invested in any single institution are limited to the extent possible in order to minimize concentration of counterparty credit risk.; 0
0001.00222; Marketable securities may consist of time deposits, registered money market funds, U.S. agency securities, U.S. Treasury securities, commercial paper, non-U.S. government securities and corporate debt securities. We have not incurred any credit risk losses related to deposits in cash or investments in marketable securities.Certain of our contracts are subject to foreign currency risk.; 0
0001.00223; We limit exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in most of our engineering and construction contracts through provisions that require client payments in currencies corresponding to the currency in which cost is incurred.; 0
0001.00224; As a result, we generally do not need to hedge foreign currency cash flows for contract work performed.; 0
0001.00225; However, in cases where revenue and expenses are not denominated in the same currency, we may hedge our exposure, if material and if an efficient market exists, as discussed below.We utilize derivative instruments to mitigate certain financial exposures, including currency and oil price risk associated with engineering and construction contracts, currency risk associated with monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and risk associated with interest rate volatility.; 0
0001.00226; As of December 31, 2020, we had total gross notional amounts of $977 million of foreign currency contracts (primarily related to the Canadian Dollar, Chinese Yuan, British Pound, Euro, Indian Rupee and Philippine Peso) and $28 million of commodity contracts.; 0
0001.00227; The foreign currency and commodity contracts are of varying duration, none of which extend beyond December 2024.; 0
0001.00228; Our historical gains and losses associated with foreign currency contracts have typically been immaterial, and have largely mitigated the exposures being hedged.; 0
0001.00229; We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.Our results reported by foreign subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are also affected by foreign currency volatility.; 0
