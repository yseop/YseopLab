0001.00008; Given the continued unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding government restrictions and customer behavior, there are a wide-range of feasible financial results for 2021. Throughout 2020, the Company's COVID-19 Testing has helped to offset the pressure experienced in the Base Business.; 0
0001.00009; To date, the Company has performed more than 18 million PCR and 3.0 million antibody COVID-19 tests and as of February 25, 2021, has the capacity to perform 275,000 PCR and 300,000 antibody tests per day, subject to the availability of equipment and testing supplies and key personnel.; 0

The increase in revenues was due to organic growth of 30.9% and acquisitions of 1.3%.; 1
0001.00020; The 30.9% increase in organic revenue was due to a 39.8% contribution from COVID-19 Testing, partially offset by an 8.9% decline of the organic Base Business which includes a 1.0% negative impact from PAMA.Total volume, measured by requisitions, increased by 7.8% as organic volume increased by 6.5% and acquisition volume contributed growth of 1.3%.; 1

0001.00090; The Company’s critical accounting policies arise in conjunction with the following:•Revenue recognition •Business combinations•Pension expense•Accruals for self-insurance reserves•Income taxes and•Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets.Revenue RecognitionDxWithin the Dx segment, a revenue transaction is initiated when Dx receives a requisition order to perform a diagnostic test.; 0
0001.00091; The information provided on the requisition form is used to determine the party that will be billed for the testing performed and the expected reimbursement. Dx recognizes revenue and satisfies its performance obligation for services rendered when the testing process is complete and the associated results are reported.; 0
0001.00092; Revenues are distributed among four payer portfolios - clients, patients, Medicare and Medicaid and third-party. Dx considers negotiated discounts and anticipated adjustments, including historical collection experience for the payer portfolio, when sales are recorded.; 0
0001.00093; The following are descriptions of the Dx payer portfolios:ClientsClient payers represent the portion of Dx’s revenue related to physicians, hospitals, health systems, accountable care organizations (ACOs), employers and other entities where payment is received exclusively from the entity ordering the testing service.; 0
0001.00094; Generally, client revenues are recorded on a fee-for-service basis at Dx’s client list price, less any negotiated discount. A portion of client billing is for laboratory management services, collection kits and other non-testing services or products.; 0
0001.00095; In these cases, revenue is recognized when services are rendered or delivered.; 0
0001.00096; PatientsThis portfolio includes revenue from uninsured patients and member cost-share for insured patients (e.g., coinsurance, deductibles and non-covered services). Uninsured patients are billed based upon Dx’s patient fee schedules, net of any discounts negotiated with physicians on behalf of their patients.; 0
0001.00097; Dx bills insured patients as directed by their health plan and after consideration of the fees and terms associated with an established health plan contract. Medicare and MedicaidThis portfolio relates to fee-for-service revenue from traditional Medicare and Medicaid programs.; 0
0001.00098; Net revenue from these programs is based on the fee schedule established by the related government authority.; 0
0001.00099; In addition to contractual discounts, other adjustments including anticipated payer denials are considered when determining net revenue.; 0
0001.00100; Any remaining adjustments to revenue are recorded at the time of final collection and settlement. These adjustments are not material to Dx’s results of operations in any period presented.Third-PartyThird-party includes revenue related to MCOs.; 0
0001.00101; The majority of Dx's third-party revenue is reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis.; 0
0001.00102; These payers are billed at Dx's established list price and revenue is recorded net of contractual discounts. The majority of Dx’s MCO revenues are recorded based upon contractually negotiated fee schedules with revenues for non-contracted MCOs recorded based on historical reimbursement experience.; 0
0001.00103; Third-party reimbursement is also received through capitation agreements with MCOs and independent physician associations (IPAs). Under capitated agreements, revenue is recognized based on a negotiated per-member, per-month payment for an agreed upon menu of tests, or based upon the proportionate share earned by Dx from a capitation pool.; 0
0001.00104; When the agreed upon reimbursement is based solely on an established rate per member, revenue is not impacted by the volume of testing 56Indexperformed.; 0
0001.00105; Under a capitation pool arrangement, the aggregate value of an established rate per member is distributed based on the volume and complexity of the procedures performed by laboratories participating in the agreement.; 0
0001.00106; Dx recognizes revenue monthly, based upon the established capitation rate or anticipated distribution from a capitated pool. Dx has a formal process to estimate implicit price concessions for uncollectable accounts.; 0
0001.00107; The majority of Dx's collection risk is related to accounts receivable from both insured and uninsured patients who are unwilling or unable to pay. Anticipated write-offs are recorded as adjustments to revenue at an amount considered necessary to record the segment's revenue at its net realizable value.; 0
0001.00108; In addition to contractual discounts, other adjustments including anticipated payer denials and other external factors that could affect the collectability of its receivables are considered when determining revenue and the net receivable amount.; 0
0001.00109; Any remaining adjustments to revenue are recorded at the time of final collection and settlement.; 0
0001.00110; These adjustments are not material to Dx's results of operations in any period presented.DDThe nature of DD’s obligations includes agreements to provide preclinical services, to manage a full clinical trial, provide services for a specific phase of a trial, or provide research products to the customer.; 0
0001.00111; Generally, the amount of the transaction price estimated at the beginning of the contract is equal to the amount expected to be billed to the customer. Other payments may also factor into the calculation of transaction price, such as volume-based rebates that are retroactively applied to prior transactions in the period.; 0
0001.00112; Historically a majority of DD's revenues have been earned under contracts that range in duration from a few months to a few years, but can extend in duration up to five years or longer. Occasionally, DD also has entered into minimum volume arrangements with certain customers.; 0
0001.00113; Under these types of arrangements, if the annual minimum dollar value of a service commitment is not reached, the customer is required to pay DD for the shortfall.; 0
0001.00114; Annual minimum commitment shortfalls are not recognized until the end of the period when the amount has been determined and agreed to by the customer.DD recognizes revenue either as services are performed or as products are delivered, depending on the nature of the work contracted.; 0
0001.00115; If performance is completed at a specific point in time, the Company evaluates the nature of the agreement to determine when the good or service is transferred into the customer’s control.; 0
0001.00116; Service contracts generally take the form of fee-for-service or fixed-price arrangements subject to pricing adjustments based on changes in scope. In cases where performance spans multiple accounting periods, revenue is recognized as services are performed, measured on a proportional-performance basis, using either input or output methods that are specific to the service provided.; 0
0001.00117; In an output method, revenue is determined by dividing the actual units of output achieved by the total units of output required under the contract and multiplying that percentage by the total contract value. The total contract value, or total contractual payments, represents the aggregate contracted price for each of the agreed upon services to be provided.; 0
0001.00118; When using an input method, revenue is recognized by dividing the actual units of input incurred by the total units of input budgeted in the contract, and multiplying that percentage by the total contract value. In each situation, the Company believes that the methods used most accurately depict the progress of the Company towards completing its obligations.; 0
0001.00119; Billing schedules and payment terms are generally negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. In some cases, DD bills the customer for the total contract value in progress-based installments as certain non-contingent billing milestones are reached over the contract duration.; 0
0001.00120; These milestones include, but are not limited to, contract signing, initial dosing, investigator site initiation, patient enrollment and/or database lock.; 0
0001.00121; The term “billing milestone” relates only to a billing trigger in a contract whereby amounts become billable and payable in accordance with a negotiated predetermined billing schedule throughout the term of a project. These billing milestones are generally not performance-based (i.e., there is no potential additional consideration tied to specific deliverables or performance).; 0
0001.00122; In other cases, billing and payment terms are tied to the passage of time (e.g., monthly billings). In either case, the total contract value and aggregate amounts billed to the customer would be the same at the end of the project.; 0
0001.00123; Proportional performance contracts typically contain a single service (e.g., management of a clinical study) and therefore no allocation of the contract price is required. Fee-for-service contracts are typically priced based on transaction volume.; 0
0001.00124; Since the volume of activities in a fee-for-service contract is unspecified, the contract price is entirely variable and is allocated to the time period in which it is earned.; 0
0001.00125; For contracts that include multiple distinct goods and services, DD allocates the contract price to the goods and services based on a customer price list, if available. If a price list is not available, DD will estimate the transaction price using either market prices or an “expected cost plus margin” approach.While DD attempts to negotiate terms that provide for billing and payment of services prior or within close proximity to the provision of services, this is not always possible.; 0
0001.00126; While a project is ongoing, cash payments are not necessarily representative of aggregate revenue earned at any particular point in time, as revenues are recognized when services are provided, while amounts billed and paid are in accordance with the negotiated billing and payment terms.57IndexIn some cases, payments received are in excess of revenue recognized.; 0
0001.00127; For example, a contract invoicing schedule may provide for an upfront payment of 10% of the full contract value upon contract signing, but at the time of signing performance of services has not yet begun.; 0
0001.00128; Payments received in advance of services being provided are deferred as contract liabilities on the balance sheet. As the contracted services are subsequently performed and the associated revenue is recognized, the contract liability balance is reduced by the amount of revenue recognized during the period.In other cases, services may be provided and revenue recognized before the customer is invoiced.; 0
0001.00129; In these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed, and the difference, representing a contract asset, is recorded for the amount that is currently not billable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms. Once the customer is invoiced, the contract asset is reduced for the amount billed, and a corresponding account receivable is recorded.; 0
0001.00130; All contract assets are billable to customers within one year from the respective balance sheet date.Most contracts are terminable with or without cause by the customer, either immediately or upon notice. These contracts often require payment to DD of expenses to wind down the study or project, fees earned to date and, in some cases, a termination fee or a payment to DD of some portion of the fees or profits that could have been earned by DD under the contract if it had not been terminated early.; 0
0001.00131; Termination fees are included in revenues when services are performed and realization is assured.The following are descriptions of the revenue recognition models of the drug development services provided by DD:Preclinical services include fee-for-service activities such as bioanalytical testing services, and proportional performance activities such as toxicology studies.; 0
0001.00132; Revenue for sale of research models is recognized at a point in time, typically upon shipment, when control transferred to the customer. Revenue for bioanalytical testing services is recognized at a point in time upon communication of results to the customer.; 0
0001.00133; Revenue for proportional performance activities, including toxicology studies, is recognized using an input-based measure of progress in which revenue is recognized as expenses are incurred for the research models, labor hours, and other costs attributable to the study.; 0
0001.00134; Through its central laboratory, DD produces and supplies specimen collection kits that are utilized in clinical studies, and provides transportation, project management, data management, and laboratory testing services on an as-needed basis throughout the duration of its customers’ clinical studies. Revenue for central laboratory services is recognized using an output-based measure of progress based on volume of activities in each period.; 0
0001.00135; DD also provides long-term specimen storage services, for which revenue is recognized using an input-based measure of progress based on costs incurred.DD provides clinical development and commercialization services, including clinical pharmacology services, full management of Phase II through IV clinical studies, and market access solutions. Revenue for clinical pharmacology services, which includes first-in-human trials, is recognized using an output-based measure of progress based on bed nights.; 0
0001.00136; The majority of clinical development and commercialization service long-term contracts are service contracts for clinical research that represent a single performance obligation (e.g., management of a clinical study).; 0
0001.00137; Revenue for these service contracts is recognized over time based on the progress of the performance obligation which is measured by the proportion of the actual costs incurred to the total costs expected to complete the contract (including labor and pass-through costs such as investigator grants and reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses). This cost-based method of revenue recognition requires management to estimate the costs to complete these services on an ongoing basis.; 0
0001.00138; Clinical services utilizing the input-based measure of progress account for approximately 50% of DD revenue. Revenue for market access solutions is recognized using various methods.; 0
0001.00139; Revenue for fee-for-service arrangements, such as reimbursement consulting hotlines and patient assistance programs, is recognized using an output method based on transaction volume which corresponds to the amount charged to the customer.; 0
0001.00140; For consulting services billed based on time and materials, revenue is recognized using the right to invoice practical expedient.DD endeavors to assess and monitor the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the ordinary course of business. DD maintains a provision for doubtful accounts relating to amounts due that may not be collected.; 0
0001.00141; This bad debt provision is monitored on a monthly basis and adjusted as circumstances warrant. Since the recorded bad debt provision is based upon management's judgment, actual bad debt write-offs may be greater or less than the amount recorded.; 0
0001.00142; Historically, bad debt write-offs have not been material. Business CombinationsThe Company accounts for business combination transactions under the acquisition method of accounting and reported the results of operations of the acquired entities from its respective date of acquisition.; 0
0001.00143; Assets acquired were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Estimated fair values were based on various valuation methodologies, including an income approach using primarily discounted cash flow techniques for the customer relationships intangible assets.; 0
0001.00144; The aforementioned income methods utilize management's estimates of future operating results and cash flows discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects market participant assumptions.; 0
0001.00145; The excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed over the fair value of the assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.; 0
0001.00146; The goodwill reflects management's expectations 58Indexof the ability to gain access to and penetrate the acquired entities' historical patient base and the benefits of being able to leverage operational efficiencies with favorable growth opportunities based on positive demographic trends in the market.; 0
0001.00147; None of the goodwill recorded as a result of the current year transactions is deductible for federal income tax purposes. As described in Note 3 Business Acquisitions and Dispositions to the consolidated financial statements, the Company acquired various businesses and related assets for approximately $267.6 in cash (net of cash acquired).; 0
0001.00148; The purchase consideration for all acquisitions has been allocated to the estimated fair market value of the net assets acquired, including approximately $121.3 in identifiable intangible assets and a residual amount of non-tax-deductible goodwill of approximately $166.2. The amortization periods for intangible assets acquired from these businesses range from 12 to 15 years for customer relationships.; 0
0001.00149; These acquisitions were made primarily to extend the Company's geographic reach in important market areas, enhance the Company's scientific differentiation and to expand the breadth and scope of the Company's CRO services. The excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed over the fair value of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.; 0
0001.00150; The goodwill reflects the Company's expectations to utilize the acquired businesses’ workforce and established relationships and the benefits of being able to leverage operational efficiencies with favorable growth opportunities in these markets.; 0
0001.00151; Pension ExpenseThe Company sponsors both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans which provide benefits based on various criteria such as years of service and salary.; 0
0001.00152; The Company maintained two plans in the United States, three plans in the United Kingdom and one in Germany. The two plans in the United States (U.S. Plans) were closed to new entrants and the accrual of service credits at the end of 2009.; 0
0001.00153; The U.K. pension plans were closed to new entrants and the accrual of service credits for one plan as of December 31, 2002 and the accrual of service credits for the other two plans as of December 31, 2019. The German plan is closed to new entrants but participants continue to accrue service credits.; 0
0001.00154; The U.K. and German plans are aggregated for disclosure as the Non-U.S. Plans.The Company's net pension cost is developed from actuarial valuations.; 0
0001.00155; Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates and expected return on plan assets, which are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each year. The Company is required to consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates, in making these assumptions.; 0
0001.00156; Changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions.; 0
0001.00157; The key assumptions used in accounting for the defined-benefit retirement plans are summarized below:Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs are as follows:U. S. PlansNon-U.S. PlansYear ended December 31, 2020Discount rate3.3 %1.7 %Salary increasesN/A3.1 %Expected long term rate of return 6.0 %3.5 Cash balance interest credit rate4.0 %N/AWeighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit obligations are as follows:U. S. PlansNon-U.S. PlansYear Ended December 31, 2020Discount rate2.3 %1.2 %Salary increasesN/A2.0 %Discount RateThe Company evaluates several approaches toward setting the discount rate assumption that is used to value the benefit obligations of its retirement plans. At year-end, priority was given to use of the Towers Watson Bond:Link model, which simulates the purchase of investment-grade corporate bonds at current market yields with principal amounts and maturity dates closely matching the Company's projected cash disbursements from its plans.; 0
0001.00158; This completed model represents the yields to maturity at which the Company could theoretically settle its plan obligations at year end. The weighted-average yield on the modeled bond portfolio is then used to form the discount rate assumption used for each retirement plan.; 0
0001.00159; A one percentage point decrease or increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a respective increase or decrease in 2020 retirement plan expense of $1.9 for the U.S Plans.; 0
0001.00160; A one percentage point decrease or increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a respective increase or decrease in 2020 retirement plan expense of $2.1 for the Non-U.S. Plans.59IndexReturn on Plan AssetsIn establishing its expected return on plan assets assumption, the Company reviews its asset allocation and develops return assumptions based on different asset classes, adjusting for plan operating expenses. Actual asset over/under performance compared to expected returns will respectively decrease/increase unrecognized loss.; 0
0001.00161; The change in the unrecognized loss will change amortization cost in upcoming periods. A one percentage point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have resulted in a corresponding change in 2020 pension expense of $2.5 for the U.S. Plans.; 0
0001.00162; A one percentage point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have resulted in a corresponding change in 2020 pension expense of $4.8 for the Non-U.S. Plans.Net pension cost for 2020 was $11.0 as compared with $13.8 in 2019. The decrease in pension expense was due to market performance partially offset by lower discount rates.; 1
0001.00163; Pension expense for the U.S. Plans is expected to decrease to $6.5 in 2021 primarily due to the impact of strong asset returns in 2020, and the $30.0 contribution made in December 2020, offset by lower discount rates in certain plans.; 0
0001.00164; Pension expense for the Non-U.S. Plans is expected to decrease by approximately $0.2 in 2021, primarily due to lower service cost partially offset by a lower discount rate in 2021.Further information on the Company’s defined-benefit retirement plans is provided in Note 17 Pension and Postretirement Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Accruals for Self-Insurance ReservesAccruals for self-insurance reserves (including workers’ compensation, auto and employee medical) are determined based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical payment trends and claims history, actuarial assumptions and current and estimated future economic conditions. These estimated liabilities are not discounted.; 0
0001.00165; The Company is self-insured (up to certain limits) for professional liability claims arising in the normal course of business, generally related to the testing and reporting of laboratory test results.; 0
0001.00166; The Company maintains excess insurance which limits the Company’s maximum exposure on individual claims.; 0
0001.00167; The Company estimates a liability that represents the ultimate exposure for aggregate losses below those limits. The liability is based on assumptions and factors for known and incurred but not reported claims, including the frequency and payment trends of historical claims.If actual trends differ from these estimates, the financial results could be impacted.; 0
0001.00168; Historical trends have not differed significantly from these estimates.Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax loss carryforwards.; 0
0001.00169; Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.; 0
0001.00170; The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.; 0
0001.00171; The Company does not recognize a tax benefit, unless the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. If the recognition threshold is met, the Company recognizes a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that the Company believes is greater than 50% likely to be realized.; 0
0001.00172; The Company records interest and penalties in income tax expense.Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived AssetsThe Company assesses goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. In accordance with updates to the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) authoritative guidance regarding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing, an entity is allowed to first assess qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing.; 0
0001.00173; If an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the estimated fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value, then no further testing is required. Otherwise, impairment testing must be performed in accordance with the original accounting standards.; 0
0001.00174; The updated FASB guidance also allows an entity to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in its goodwill assessment and proceed directly to performing the quantitative assessment. Similarly, a company can proceed directly to a quantitative assessment in the case of impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets as well.; 0
0001.00175; The quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit as compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit.; 0
0001.00176; Reporting units are businesses with discrete financial information that is available and reviewed by management.; 0
0001.00177; The Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using both income-based and market-based 60Indexvaluation methods.; 0
0001.00178; The income-based approach is based on the reporting unit's forecasted future cash flows that are discounted to the present value using the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital. For the market-based approach, the Company utilizes a number of factors such as publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of the Company as well as operating results, business plans, market multiples, and present value techniques.; 0
0001.00179; Based upon the range of estimated values developed from the income and market-based methods, the Company determines the estimated fair value for the reporting unit.; 0
0001.00180; If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, the goodwill is not impaired, and no further review is required.; 0
0001.00181; An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.The income-based fair value methodology requires management's assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates and conditions in the capital markets, many of which are outside of management's control.; 0
0001.00182; At the reporting unit level, fair value estimation requires management's assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific reporting unit, along with assessment of the reporting unit's strategies and forecasts of future cash flows. Forecasts of individual reporting unit cash flows involve management's estimates and assumptions regarding:•Annual cash flows, on a debt-free basis, arising from future revenues and profitability, changes in working capital, capital spending and income taxes for at least a five-year forecast period.•A terminal growth rate for years beyond the forecast period.; 0
0001.00183; The terminal growth rate is selected based on consideration of growth rates used in the forecast period, historical performance of the reporting unit and economic conditions.•A discount rate that reflects the risks inherent in realizing the forecasted cash flows.; 0
0001.00184; A discount rate considers the risk-free rate of return on long-term treasury securities, the risk premium associated with investing in equity securities of comparable companies, the beta obtained from the comparable companies and the cost of debt for investment grade issuers. In addition, the discount rate may consider any company-specific risk in achieving the prospective financial information.; 0
0001.00185; Under the market-based fair value methodology, judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions. Management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of the reporting units.; 0
0001.00186; The Company assesses goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.; 0
0001.00187; Based upon the revised forecasted revenues and operating income following the declaration of the COVID-19 global pandemic, management concluded there was a triggering event and updated its annual 2019 goodwill impairment testing as of March 31, 2020, for certain of its DD and Dx reporting units.; 0
0001.00188; Based on the quantitative impairment assessment performed in the same manner as the Company's annual quantitative assessment, the Company concluded that the fair value was less than carrying value for two of its reporting units, including one where the 2019 fair value exceeded carrying value by approximately 10.0%, and recorded a goodwill impairment of $418.7 for the DD segment and $3.7 for the Dx segment. Management performed its annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2020.; 0
0001.00189; The Company elected to perform the qualitative assessment for goodwill and intangible assets for the domestic Dx reporting units and certain DD reporting units, a quantitative assessment for two of the DD reporting units, and a quantitative assessment for the Canadian reporting unit and its indefinite-lived assets consisting of acquired Canadian licenses.In the qualitative assessment, the Company considered relevant events and circumstances for each reporting unit, including (i) current year results, (ii) financial performance versus management’s annual and five-year strategic plans, (iii) changes in the reporting unit carrying value since prior year, (iv) industry and market conditions in which the reporting unit operates, (v) macroeconomic conditions, including discount rate changes, and (vi) changes in products or services offered by the reporting unit.; 0
0001.00190; If applicable, performance in recent years was compared to forecasts included in prior valuations.; 0
0001.00191; Based on the results of the qualitative assessment, the Company concluded that it was not more likely than not that the carrying values of the goodwill and intangible assets were greater than their fair values, and that further quantitative testing was not necessary.In 2020, the Company utilized a combination of the market and income approaches to determine the fair value of the DD reporting units and the income approach to determine the fair value of the Canadian reporting unit and its indefinite-lived assets consisting of acquired Canadian licenses. Based upon the results of the quantitative assessments, the Company concluded that the fair values of the goodwill and intangible assets, including the indefinite-lived Canadian licenses, was greater than the carrying value.It is possible that the Company's conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or intangible assets in any reporting unit could change in future periods.; 0
0001.00192; There can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in the Company's goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing performed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2020 will 61Indexprove to be accurate predictions of the future, if, for example, (i) the businesses do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in 2020 or future years vary from current assumptions (including changes in discount rates), (iii) business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions, including loss of major customers, (iv) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or (v) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower multiples of revenues and EBITDA. Management's impairment analysis for certain reporting units utilized significant judgments and assumptions related to the market comparable method analysis, such as selected market multiples, and related to cash flow projections, such as revenue and terminal growth rate, projected operating income, and the discount rate.; 0
0001.00193; A significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the revenue and terminal growth rate, decreased operation margin or substantial reductions in end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of certain reporting units. A future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.Item 7A.; 0
0001.00194; QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK (in millions)Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and other relevant market rate or price changes. In the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to various market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange and interest rates, and the Company regularly evaluates the exposure to such changes.; 0
0001.00195; The Company addresses its exposure to market risks, principally the market risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that includes, from time to time, the use of derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts, cross currency swaps and interest rate swap agreements.
