0001.00002; Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsSeparation of PPG's commodity chemicals business and acquisition of the North American architectural coatings business of Akzo Nobel N.V.In 2013, PPG completed two additional steps in its strategic transformation into a more focused coatings and specialty materials company.PPG completed the first step on January 28, 2013 with the separation of its commodity chemicals business and the merger of the subsidiary holding the PPG commodity chemicals business with a subsidiary of the Georgia Gulf Corporation (Georgia Gulf).; 0
0001.00003; Refer to Note 22, Separation and Merger Transaction under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for financial information relating to this transaction.; 0
0001.00004; The second step was completed on April 1, 2013 with the completion of the acquisition of the North American architectural coatings business of Akzo Nobel N.V..; 0
0001.00005; The acquisition included the purchase of a number of leading brands and 526 paint stores, net of redundant store closures, in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean.; 0
0001.00006; Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for financial information relating to this transaction.Performance in 2013 compared with 2012Performance OverviewNet sales increased $1,596 million, or 12% from the prior year, to $15,108 million primarily due to sales of acquired businesses, which increased net sales by approximately 10%.; 1
0001.00007; The AkzoNobel North American architectural coatings business acquired in April 2013 contributed approximately $1,165 million in net sales while the acquisitions of Deft, an aerospace coatings business acquired in May 2013, and the Spraylat coatings business acquired in December 2012, contributed approximately $166 million combined.; 0
0001.00008; Overall sales volumes, excluding acquisitions, were level with the prior year as sales volume growth in the Industrial Coatings, Optical and Specialty Materials and Glass segments as well as the aerospace business was offset by volume declines in the remaining segments and other businesses.; 0
0001.00009; Sales volumes were inconsistent by region.; 0
0001.00010; The U.S. and Canada and the Latin America regions' sales volumes were up nearly 3% year over 182013 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-KTable of Contentsyear.; 0
0001.00011; Growth occurred in many end-use markets in Asia Pacific, although total sales volumes for the region were nearly level year over year due to declines stemming from lower marine new-build end-use market demand.; 1
0001.00012; Sales volumes in Europe were down 4% year over year due to weak demand that occurred in the first half of the year.; 1
0001.00013; The 2013 volume decline in Europe continued the trend experienced since the recession began in 2009.; 0
0001.00014; Aggregate PPG coatings volumes in that region have declined over 20% versus year 2008 pre-recession levels.; 0
0001.00015; Whereas combined PPG coatings volumes in the remaining regions are higher in comparison to year 2008 pre-recession levels, as growth in emerging regions of nearly 20% has been partially offset by a 5% decline in the U.S. and Canada.; 0
0001.00016; Higher selling prices added just over 1% to net sales which included the carryover impact from 2012 price increases to offset current year inflation in certain cost components, including increases in transportation, energy and labor costs.; 0
0001.00017; The impact of foreign currency translation on net sales was flat for the year, although results were mixed by currency.; 0
0001.00018; Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased $731 million, or 9% from the prior year, to $8,636 million primarily due to the inclusion of cost of sales from acquired businesses partially offset by lower manufacturing costs.; 1
0001.00019; Cost of sales as a percentage of sales in 2013 was 57.2% compared to 58.5% in 2012. This decrease is largely due to shifts in sales margin mix related to the businesses acquired.; 1
0001.00020; Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $499 million, or 16% from the prior year, to $3,699 million principally related to the inclusion of acquired businesses and overhead cost inflation partly offset by the impact of our continued focus on cost management, including savings from restructuring actions initiated in 2012.; 1
0001.00021; As a percent of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased slightly to 24.5% in 2013 from 23.7% in 2012 primarily due to the addition of acquired businesses which have higher distribution related costs.; 1
0001.00022; Depreciation expense increased $44 million, or 14% from the prior year, to $356 million primarily due to the depreciation of the acquired businesses.; 1
0001.00023; The restructuring charge of $98 million relates to a restructuring plan approved in the third quarter of 2013 focused on achieving cost synergies, through improved productivity and efficiency, related to the acquired North American architectural coatings business, but also includes smaller targeted actions for PPG's legacy architectural business, as well as other businesses where market conditions remain very challenging, most notably protective and marine coatings and certain European businesses such as architectural coatings and fiber glass.; 1
0001.00024; Other charges decreased $34 million, or 15% from the prior year, to $190 million primarily due to lower legacy environmental remediation charges in 2013.; 1
0001.00025; In 2013, the largest charge included in other charges relates to a pretax charge of $89 million for the environmental remediation at a former chromium manufacturing plant and associated sites in New Jersey and a pretax charge of $12 million related to environmental remediation at a legacy chemical manufacturing site.; 0
0001.00026; The 2012 other charges included a pretax charge of $159 million, related primarily to the environmental remediation at the former chromium manufacturing plant and associated sites in New Jersey.; 1
0001.00027; Other income decreased $8 million, or 6% from the prior year, to $131 million primarily due to lower equity earnings, primarily from our Asian fiber glass joint ventures as a result of a decline in demand in the personal computer market and lower licensing earnings in the Glass segment.; 1
0001.00028; The effective tax rate on income before income taxes was 22% and 21% in 2013 and 2012, respectively.; 0
0001.00029; See the Regulation G reconciliation below for details of PPG's adjusted effective tax rate from continuing operations.; 0
0001.00030; Diluted earnings-per-share for 2013 were $22.27 per-share, comprised of net income from continuing operations of $7.13 per-share and discontinued operations, net of tax of $15.14 per-share.; 0
0001.00031; The increase in diluted earnings-per-share resulted from higher net income and a reduction in the number of shares outstanding as a result of the 10.8 million PPG shares tendered to the Company in the exchange offer in connection with the separation and merger of the Company's former commodity chemicals business as well as the approximately 5.7 million shares repurchased during 2013.; 1
0001.00032; For more information about the separation and merger of the Company's former commodity chemicals business, see Note 22, “Separation and Merger Transaction,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Regulation G Reconciliation - Results from OperationsPPG Industries believes investors’ understanding of the Company’s operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of income before income taxes, PPG's effective tax rate, tax expense, net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share adjusted for nonrecurring charges.; 0
0001.00033; PPG’s management considers this information useful in providing insight into the company’s ongoing operating performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on an ongoing basis.; 0
0001.00034; Income before income taxes, the effective tax rate, tax expense, net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share adjusted for these items are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered a substitute for income before income taxes, the effective tax rate, tax expense, net income from continuing operations or earnings per diluted share or other financial measures as computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP.; 0
0001.00035; Legacy pension settlement costs18 5 27.8%; 0
0001.00036; Legacy pension settlement costs13 0.09; 0
0001.00037; Sales volumes remained varied by region and business.; 0
0001.00038; Volume growth continued in the aerospace coatings business where industry demand remains strong. Automotive refinish volumes were level with the prior year as growth in the Asia Pacific and Latin American regions offset volume declines in Europe, while the North American refinish volumes were consistent with 2012.; 0
0001.00039; Offsetting the segment sales volume gains was a decline in volume in the protective and marine coatings business due to further, notable weakness in the Asian marine new-build market reflecting lower global demand.; 1
0001.00040; U.S. and Canada architectural coatings sales volume declined by low-single-digit percentages with mid-to-high single digit percentage same store growth in company-owned stores, lower sales in national retail accounts 202013 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-KTable of Contentsand lower sales in the independent dealer channel.; 0
0001.00041; The lower sales volume in the national account channel was due to a previously disclosed change in products sold to a large retail customer.; 1
0001.00042; Segment income was $858 million for 2013, an increase of $114 million, or 15%, compared to the prior year primarily due to the income from acquired businesses, lower overhead and manufacturing costs stemming from prior restructuring actions and ongoing cost management, offset partially by the negative impact on segment income from the lower sales volumes.; 1
0001.00043; Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2014, we expect aerospace growth to continue, despite more difficult comparisons following several consecutive years of solid growth.; 0
0001.00044; We also anticipate global refinish continued growth, as initial European demand recovery supplements growth in emerging regions.; 0
0001.00045; We expect marine new-build demand to remain weak, but less negative year-over-year than in 2013 as marine new-build demand levels off.; 0
0001.00046; North American architectural coatings industry market conditions are expected to remain solid, and we expect growth to occur in all three distribution channels.; 0
0001.00047; At the beginning of 2014, PPG implemented mid-single-digit percentage price increases in company-owned stores.; 0
0001.00048; We anticipate normal architectural coatings seasonality to result in higher first quarter sales versus the recently completed fourth quarter.; 0
0001.00049; We expect first quarter 2014 segment results to benefit from the acquired-business sales and income from continuing operations, including a higher level of cost synergies.Industrial Coatings net sales increased $466 million, or 11% from the prior year, to $4,845 million primarily due to volume growth (6%) and net sales from acquired businesses (4%).; 0
0001.00050; In 2013, PPG's global automotive OEM coatings sales volumes grew 10%, outpacing global industry auto production growth of about 3% year-over-year. The industrial coatings business experienced varied sales volume results by region compared with the prior year, as strong improvements across emerging regions and modestly higher volumes in North America were offset by weak demand in Europe.; 0
0001.00051; Packaging coatings sales volumes grew modestly in Asia Pacific and Latin America, were down low-single-digits year-over-year in Europe and essentially flat in North America.; 0
0001.00052; Segment income increased $134 million, or 23% from the prior year, to $724 million primarily due to the impact from the higher sales coupled with ongoing cost management initiatives and the benefits from the Company's restructuring actions initiated in 2012.; 1
0001.00053; Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2014, we expect global growth in general industrial activity to continue, including solid North American growth, continuing growth in emerging regions and improved European demand.; 0
0001.00054; Similarly, we expect growth in global automotive OEM production to be consistent with recent quarters, with forecasted growth in all major regions.; 0
0001.00055; We expect our automotive OEM business to deliver above-market growth.; 0
0001.00056; Architectural Coatings – EMEA net sales decreased $85 million, or 4% from the prior year, to $2,062 million primarily due to lower sales volumes (7%) as economic conditions worsened in most European countries.; 1
0001.00057; However, market demand improved somewhat in the second half of the year but remained negative overall and mixed across the region.; 0
0001.00058; Poor weather conditions in the first half of 2013 were also a contributor to the decline in sales volumes.; 1
0001.00059; The decline in sales volumes was partially offset by the impacts of favorable pricing and foreign currency translation (2%).; 0
0001.00060; Despite the year-over-year volume decline, segment income was $184 million in 2013, an increase of $39 million, or 27% from the prior year, primarily due to lower costs, including discretionary cost management coupled with the structural cost improvements stemming from the restructuring actions initiated in 2012, partially offset by the impact of lower net sales on income from continuing operations.; 1
0001.00061; Looking ahead, year-over-year segment income for 2013 was greatly aided by cost savings stemming from restructuring actions that are substantially completed.; 0
0001.00062; Accordingly, 2014 results will be more dependent on the pace of regional volume demand.; 0
0001.00063; We anticipate normal seasonal architectural coatings sales growth in the first quarter of 2014.; 0
0001.00064; We expect demand in the region to continue to stabilize in comparison to negative year-over-year market results in 2013, and results will likely remain mixed by end-use market.; 0
0001.00065; Based on current exchange rates, currency translation will aid first quarter net sales but remain inconsequential to segment income.Optical and Specialty Materials net sales increased $60 million, or 5% from the prior year, to $1,262 million primarily due to an increase in sales volumes (3%) and higher pricing (2%).; 1
0001.00066; The increase in sales was driven by strong demand at the end of 2013 as volumes were aided by initial customer inventory stocking ahead of the January 2014 North American introduction of Transitions Generation VII.; 1
0001.00067; This brought year-to-date sales above prior year levels as sales in this segment had been lower versus a strong first half of 2012 that was aided by the optical industry recovery from the fourth quarter 2011 Thailand flooding and related inventory restocking.; 0
0001.00068; The silicas business achieved higher year over year volumes in both the U.S. and Europe as a result of solid demand growth.; 1
0001.00069; Segment income was $368 million, an increase of $20 million, or 6% from the prior year, primarily due to an increase in sales and lower full-year selling and marketing costs.; 1
0001.00070; Looking ahead, optical demand is typically higher seasonally during the first quarter versus the fourth quarter.; 0
0001.00071; The Transitions new product was launched last year in Europe, and the launch is now underway in North America.; 0
0001.00072; The first quarter of 2014 will likely include modestly higher selling costs, including support for the product launch.; 0
0001.00073; We expect silica demand growth to continue.; 0
0001.00074; Glass segment net sales increased $35 million, or 3% from the prior year, to $1,067 million primarily due to higher fiber glass sales volumes.; 1
0001.00075; Sales volumes in fiber glass increased modestly, reflecting higher global demand in various end-use markets.; 1
0001.00076; Segment income was $56 million, a decrease of $7 million, or 11% from the prior year, primarily due to input cost inflation, including higher natural gas costs, lower licensing income and lower fiber glass equity earnings stemming from weaker personal computer production activity in Asia.; 1
0001.00077; These negative factors more than offset reductions in manufacturing costs.Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2014, market demand for the fiber glass and flat glass businesses is expected to improve versus weak prior year results.; 0
0001.00078; Increased flat glass 2013 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 21Table of Contentspricing has been announced and varies based on product, geography and end-use market.; 0
0001.00079; A significant, scheduled flat glass tank maintenance project is underway, with an anticipated first quarter negative impact on segment income of about $10 million and a modest impact to the second quarter of 2014.; 0
0001.00080; Also, we expect natural gas unit costs and transportation costs to be higher year-over-year, based on current market pricing.Review and Outlook During 2013, overall economic conditions remained mixed among the main global economies, with major coatings end-use markets also experiencing similar variations.; 0
0001.00081; These economic trends were an important factor in PPG’s aggregate sales volume being flat compared to the previous year. PPG increased volumes in North America in 2013, with volume growth adding to strong prior year gains and broad-based improvements across most end-use markets.; 0
0001.00082; North America remains PPG’s largest region representing 46% of sales.; 0
0001.00083; Regional industrial activity continued to improve aided by low energy costs stemming from shale energy production, and due to continued demand and production increases in several industries, including automotive OEM and aerospace.; 0
0001.00084; Regional recovery continued in construction spending, aided by higher U.S. housing starts and initial improvement in the residential remodeling market, while non-residential construction demand remained suppressed.; 0
0001.00085; Although smaller in size, demand in the Canadian construction market was also subdued.; 0
0001.00086; Growth in the region and various end-use markets was also somewhat tempered by reduced U.S. federal and state government spending.; 0
0001.00087; Throughout the year, U.S. unemployment rates improved and consumer spending expanded, supporting expectations for additional regional growth prospects for PPG entering 2014.; 0
0001.00088; The pace of European economic activity remained challenging during 2013, with the region continuing to face high unemployment and weak growth in industrial production and gross domestic product. Regional demand was extremely weak early in the year, with PPG year-over-year volumes declining by about 10% in comparison with a weak first quarter of 2012.; 0
0001.00089; During the remainder of 2013, the pace of decline in PPG's aggregate year-over-year coatings volumes lessened with each successive quarter, ending with fourth quarter volume flat with the prior year.; 0
0001.00090; Although the level of demand improvement was not consistent across the various countries in the region, overall regional economic activity continued to stabilize throughout the year.; 0
0001.00091; Europe remains a very large region for PPG, representing about one-third of PPG’s sales.; 0
0001.00092; Overall Company volumes in the region are down about 20% in comparison to 2008 pre-recession levels, reflecting the multi-year weakness experienced throughout most of the region.; 0
0001.00093; While most of the regional economies remain fragile, we see prospects for initial demand recovery in certain markets as we head into 2014.; 0
0001.00094; In the aggregate, emerging region economies continued to expand during 2013 however, growth rates were more modest versus prior years.; 0
0001.00095; Growth also varied considerably by individual country, and by industry within countries.; 0
0001.00096; The emerging markets regions of Asia and Latin America represent 22% of PPG’s sales, with Asia the largest emerging region representing sales of $2.6 billion.; 0
0001.00097; China is now PPG’s second largest individual country from a sales perspective, and demand in China and overall Asia expanded for PPG products in most industrial markets, including higher automotive production.; 0
0001.00098; Offsetting these improvements was decreased global demand in a few end-use markets, including personal computers and marine new-build, as the majority of the global production in these markets occurs in Asia.; 0
0001.00099; Demand in the Latin American economies remained erratic due to a variety of factors, including high inflation rates. PPG's Latin American volumes were slightly favorable for the year, with differences by end-use market.; 0
0001.00100; Heading into 2014, PPG anticipates overall Company volume growth in emerging regions, supported by continued economic growth in China and the absence of large volume declines in certain end-use markets like marine new-build.; 0
0001.00101; Looking ahead to 2014, we expect modest global growth to continue.; 0
0001.00102; We anticipate growth will remain the broadest in the U.S. economy, spanning across several coatings end-use markets as favorable market conditions continue in automotive OEM, architectural coatings and aerospace.; 0
0001.00103; We expect emerging regions growth to remain mixed, but we expect PPG to post solid aggregate growth based on the various end-markets the Company supplies.; 0
0001.00104; In Europe, economies appear to be improving but remain fragile.; 0
0001.00105; We anticipate modest growth in that region in 2014, and we expect solid segment income accretion benefits from the higher sales, due to the actions taken the past two years to significantly reduce PPG’s cost structure in that region.; 0
0001.00106; In 2012, PPG initiated a restructuring program to improve its productivity and efficiency, primarily focused on Europe, with targeted annual savings of $140 million.; 0
0001.00107; Throughout 2012 and 2013, PPG continued to execute actions relating to this program and substantially completed all the actions by the end of 2013 achieving the targeted annual savings level of about $140 million on a run-rate basis.; 0
0001.00108; Incremental annual savings of about $80 million annually were realized in 2013, in addition to the savings achieved during 2012.; 0
0001.00109; PPG intends to remain proactive in managing our costs.; 0
0001.00110; PPG’s Board of Directors approved a separate restructuring program resulting in a pretax charge of $98 million in the third quarter of 2013.; 0
0001.00111; The restructuring program targets an additional $100 million in annual cost savings.; 0
0001.00112; The primary focus of this program is to capture cost synergies, through improved productivity and efficiency, related to PPG’s North American architectural coatings acquisition along with separate, targeted actions relating to several other PPG businesses where business conditions remain challenging, including protective and marine coatings, fiber glass and architectural coatings EMEA.; 0
0001.00113; Actions related to this program began in late 2013 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2014, with cost savings of between $75 million and $90 million in 2014.; 0
0001.00114; Raw materials are a significant input cost in the manufacture of coatings, and PPG typically experiences fluctuating prices for energy and raw materials driven by factors, including supply/demand imbalances, global industrial activity levels and changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories. For 2014, the Company currently expects overall coatings raw material prices 222013 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-KTable of Contentsto increase modestly, with results varied by region and commodity type.; 0
0001.00115; In an effort to offset the adverse impact of cost inflation on income from continuing operations, the Company implemented higher coatings selling prices in 2011 and 2012.; 0
0001.00116; In 2013, additional targeted pricing was implemented in several businesses.; 0
0001.00117; Selling prices in Glass improved modestly during 2013, reflecting efforts to offset higher input, energy and logistics costs.; 0
0001.00118; Selective pricing actions are planned in 2014, with actions expected to differ by business and region.; 0
0001.00119; Pension and postretirement benefit costs, excluding curtailments and special termination benefits, were $177 million in 2013, down $56 million from $233 million in 2012. This decline was due, in part, to a reorganization of certain Company pension plans, which occurred as a part of separation activities of the former commodity chemicals business.; 1
0001.00120; In 2014, we expect pension and other postretirement benefit costs to decline roughly $15 million due to strong pension asset performance and a higher discount rate as measured at year-end 2013.; 0
0001.00121; During 2013, PPG's cash contributions to defined benefit pension plans totaled $174 million, including voluntary contributions to the U.S. pension plans of $50 million.; 0
0001.00122; Cash contributions in 2012 and 2011 were $80 million and $113 million, respectively.; 0
0001.00123; We anticipate 2014 contributions will be in the range of $10 million to $25 million.; 0
0001.00124; We expect our ongoing tax rate in 2014 to be in the range of 24.5% to 25.5%.; 0
0001.00125; Because of the differences in the tax rates in the countries in which we operate, a shift in the geographic mix of earnings will impact our overall ongoing tax rate. Over the past four years, the Company used $2.5 billion of cash to repurchase about 25 million shares of stock, and the Company ended the year with approximately 2.2 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorization from the Board of Directors.; 0
0001.00126; In January 2014, the Company announced that it expects PPG's strong balance sheet and cash position to be supplemented by continued strong free cash flow in 2014, along with the receipt of about $1.5 billion in after-tax proceeds from the pending sale of its ownership interest in the Transitions Optical joint venture.; 0
0001.00127; PPG also announced its intention to deploy between $3.0 billion and $4.0 billion of incremental cash over an 18 to 24 month period beginning in January 2014. The focus of this cash deployment is related to incremental earnings accretion initiatives, including return of cash to shareholders.Accounting Standards Adopted in 2013Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” under Item 8 describes the Company’s recently adopted accounting pronouncements.Accounting Standards to be Adopted in Future YearsNote 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” under Item 8 describes accounting pronouncements that have been promulgated prior to December 31, 2013 but are not effective until a future date.; 0
0001.00128; Performance in 2012 compared with 2011 Performance OverviewNet sales in 2012 increased $359 million, or 3% from the prior year, to $13,512 million primarily due to higher selling prices (3%), higher sales volumes (1%) and sales from acquired businesses (2%) partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impact (3%).; 1
0001.00129; Sales volumes varied significantly by region, with volume growth in North America of nearly 6% and modest growth in emerging regions.; 0
0001.00130; European volumes declined 4% versus the prior year period with every coatings business except aerospace experiencing sluggish end-use market conditions.; 1
0001.00131; Improved selling prices were achieved in each of the three coatings segments and Optical and Specialty Materials.; 0
0001.00132; In our coatings segments, higher selling prices were in response to persistent raw material and other cost inflation.; 1
0001.00133; The unfavorable currency impact was primarily driven by the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Euro and Latin American currencies.Increased demand was driven by stronger industrial production activity, which aided many of our businesses.; 1
0001.00134; The global industrial recovery varied by region and end-use market in 2012.; 0
0001.00135; North American growth was led by strength in the automotive OEM, aerospace and architectural coatings businesses.; 0
0001.00136; Automotive OEM coatings volumes were up year over year outpacing growth in industry demand.; 0
0001.00137; Aerospace coatings end-use market growth has remained strong.; 0
0001.00138; U.S. architectural coatings growth has been supported by improvement in construction spending, as U.S. residential construction improved throughout the year following several anemic years.; 0
0001.00139; Mild weather early in 2012 also aided U.S. architectural coatings volumes.; 0
0001.00140; Sluggish end-use market conditions in Europe were largely offset by incremental sales from acquired businesses in the region.; 0
0001.00141; Growth rates in Asia in 2012 were reduced by the low level of marine original-equipment new ship builds however, aiding growth in Asia was strength in China auto production and the packaging business as well as the absence of the Thailand floods, which particularly impacted optical products in late 2011.; 0
0001.00142; Higher selling prices in every coatings reportable segment and the Optical and Specialty Materials segment in 2012 were somewhat offset by pricing declines in the Glass reportable segment.; 0
0001.00143; In our coatings segments, prices were increased in response to persistent raw material cost inflation.; 1
0001.00144; The Glass segment's pricing was down, reflecting weaker global fiber glass demand.; 1
0001.00145; Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased by $40 million, or 0.5% from the prior year, to $7,905 million primarily due to the cost of sales of acquired businesses, the cost of sales associated with the sales volume growth and the negative impact of inflation.; 1
0001.00146; These increases were largely offset by the impact of currency translation and lower manufacturing costs.; 0
0001.00147; Cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2012 was 58.5% down from 59.8% in 2011.; 0
0001.00148; Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $78 million, or 2.5% from the prior year, to $3,200 million primarily due to increases from acquired businesses, overhead inflation partially offset by the reduction in costs due to the favorable impact of currency translation and the benefit of our restructuring actions.; 1
0001.00149; These expenses remained flat as a percent of sales at 23.7% in both 2012 and 2011, reflecting the benefits 2013 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 23Table of Contentsof our continuing effort to aggressively manage our costs even as our sales volume increases.The 2012 business restructuring charge of $208 million represents the costs associated with a restructuring plan focused on further reducing PPG’s global cost structure.; 0
0001.00150; The actions included in the restructuring plan delivered pretax cost savings in the second half of 2012 of approximately $50 million.; 0
0001.00151; Other charges increased by $161 million from the prior year to $224 million largely due to the $159 million environmental remediation charge recorded in the first quarter of 2012 related primarily to costs at a former chromium manufacturing plant and associated sites in Jersey City, New Jersey.; 1
0001.00152; Other income decreased by $13 million, or 9% from the prior year, to $139 million primarily due to $27 million of lower equity earnings, primarily from our Asian fiber glass joint ventures, reflecting demand decline in the consumer electronics market.; 1
0001.00153; The effective tax rate on income before income taxes was approximately 21% in 2012 and 2011.; 0
0001.00154; See the Regulation G reconciliation below for details of PPG's adjusted effective tax rate from continuing operations.; 0
0001.00155; Diluted earnings-per-share for 2012 were $6.06, comprised of net income from continuing operations of $4.69 per diluted share, and net income from discontinued operations of $1.37 per diluted share.; 0
0001.00156; The 2011 diluted earnings-per-share of $6.87 was comprised of net income from continuing operations of $5.40 per diluted share and net income from discontinued operations of $1.47 per diluted share.; 0
0001.00157; The increase in diluted earnings-per-share from continuing operations resulted primarily from higher adjusted income before income taxes and a reduction in the shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases in the second half of 2011 and first quarter of 2012.; 1
0001.00158; Regulation G Reconciliation - Results from OperationsPPG Industries believes investors’ understanding of the Company’s operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of income before income taxes, PPG's effective tax rate, tax expense, net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share adjusted for nonrecurring charges.; 0
0001.00159; PPG’s management considers this information useful in providing insight into the company’s ongoing operating performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on an ongoing basis.; 0
0001.00160; Income before income taxes, the effective tax rate, tax expense, net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share adjusted for these items are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered a substitute for income before income taxes, the effective tax rate, tax expense, net income from continuing operations or earnings per diluted share or other financial measures as computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP.; 0
0001.00161; In addition, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted effective tax rate, adjusted tax expense, adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies.; 0
0001.00162; Higher pricing was achieved by all the businesses in the segment reflecting continuing efforts to offset significant inflationary impacts over the past two years.; 1
0001.00163; Year-over-year segment sales volumes were nearly flat in 2012 with aerospace and architectural coatings business volume growth being offset by automotive refinish and protective and marine coatings business volume declines.; 0
0001.00164; Sales volume in the aerospace business continued to benefit from excellent end-use market growth despite increasingly difficult prior year comparable periods.; 0
0001.00165; U.S. architectural coatings were aided by early signs of a construction market recovery in the U.S. and mild weather early in 2012, offset by the absence of elevated sales in the prior year from the introduction of a new product in the national account channel.; 0
0001.00166; Volumes declined in the automotive refinish coatings business, particularly in Europe, and in the protective and marine coatings business as lower marine new build volume was somewhat offset by higher volume in protective coatings.; 0
0001.00167; Segment income was $744 million, an increase of $71 million, or 11%, from the prior year.; 0
0001.00168; Segment income improved as lower costs, relating to benefits from PPG's restructuring and other cost management actions, coupled with the effect from the higher net sales were partly offset by inflation, higher selling costs and the negative impact of foreign currency translation.The Industrial Coatings segment’s net sales increased $221 million, or 5% from the prior year, to $4,379 million primarily due to higher pricing (3%), higher sales volumes (4%) and net sales from acquired businesses (1%) partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation (3%).; 1
0001.00169; The segment sales volume growth of 4% was driven by automotive OEM coatings growth especially in North America, due in part to the recovery from the 2011 Japanese tsunami as well as continued strength in China, offset by European economic weakness.; 1
0001.00170; The current year volume gains by our automotive OEM coatings business outpaced industry growth.; 0
0001.00171; Industrial and packaging coatings volumes were mixed by region.; 0
0001.00172; Europe was weaker in both businesses.; 0
0001.00173; U.S. industrial coatings improved while emerging region demand varied by end-use with markets aligned with construction activity being down in Asia and Argentina being impacted by import restrictions.; 0
0001.00174; The consumer electronics market in Asia was slower, but packaging volumes in Asia improved.; 0
0001.00175; Emerging region sales were supplemented by sales from acquired businesses and the reorganization of our joint venture in India.; 0
0001.00176; Segment income of $590 million increased $152 million, or 35% from the prior year, as the impact of higher pricing, sales volume growth and manufacturing cost savings overcame the adverse impact of inflation and higher overhead costs incurred to support growth.; 1
0001.00177; Restructuring related cost savings also aided segment income in 2012.Architectural Coatings – EMEA segment net sales increased $43 million, or 2% from the prior year, to $2,147 million primarily due to the acquisition of Dyrup in January 2012 (8%) partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation (7%).; 1
0001.00178; Pricing increased net sales mid-single digit percents which was substantially offset by volume declines due to market weakness throughout the region.; 0
0001.00179; Segment income increased $22 million, or 18% from the prior year, to $145 million primarily due to lower costs stemming from aggressive ongoing cost management and supplemented by the cost benefits from PPG's restructuring actions and higher pricing.; 1
0001.00180; These income improvements were reduced by the impact of lower sales volumes and cost inflation.; 0
0001.00181; In addition, an unfavorable currency translation impact of $13 million was largely offset by the absence of a $9 million charge in the prior year related to a customer bankruptcy.Optical and Specialty Materials segment net sales were $1,202 million, essentially flat with the prior year.; 1
0001.00182; An unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation (3%) was offset by a price increase (1%) and sales volume growth (2%).; 0
0001.00183; Optical products achieved sales volume growth with the majority due to higher Transitions lens market penetration.; 1
0001.00184; Volumes were also aided by the absence of the prior year negative impacts from extensive Thailand flooding that disrupted optical customers and supply chains in the fourth quarter 2011.; 0
0001.00185; Silicas volumes were down modestly year over year.; 0
0001.00186; Segment income increased by $22 million, or 7% from the prior year, to $348 million as income improved in both businesses primarily due to higher sales volumes, overhead and manufacturing cost improvements, including restructuring cost savings, and higher pricing.; 1
0001.00187; Segment income was reduced by unfavorable foreign currency translation and inflation.Glass segment 2012 net sales decreased $29 million, or 3% from the prior year, to $1,032 million primarily due to lower price (3%) and unfavorable currency translation (1%), partially offset by higher sales volumes (1%).; 1
0001.00188; Improved flat glass volumes as a result of increased demand in the commercial and solar markets were substantially offset by lower fiber glass 2013 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 25Table of Contentsvolume.; 0
0001.00189; Fiber glass volumes have declined due to weak demand in Europe versus a strong prior year comparable period.; 1
0001.00190; Lower pricing in both businesses and the unfavorable impact of currency translation drove the net sales decline.; 1
0001.00191; Segment income declined $34 million, or 35% from the prior year, to $63 million. Lower pricing, cost inflation, as well as lower equity earnings, primarily related to our fiber glass joint venture selling to the consumer electronics industry, contributed to the income decline.; 1
0001.00192; These factors were only partially offset with improved flat glass volumes and improved manufacturing cost performance in fiber glass.See Note 21, “Reportable Business Segment Information,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information related to the Company’s operating segments and reportable business segments.Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, including Environmental MattersPPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others, in which substantial monetary damages are sought.; 0
0001.00193; See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” and Note 14, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a description of certain of these lawsuits, including a description of the proposed asbestos settlement.As discussed in Item 3 and Note 14, although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable, management believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving PPG, including asbestos-related claims in the event the proposed asbestos settlement described in Note 14 does not become effective, will not have a material effect on PPG’s consolidated financial position or liquidity however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized.It is PPG’s policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.; 0
0001.00194; Reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted.; 0
0001.00195; In management’s opinion, the Company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the Company’s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on PPG’s financial position or liquidity however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized.; 0
0001.00196; Management anticipates that the resolution of the Company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time.; 0
0001.00197; As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, PPG had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling $310 million and $332 million, respectively, of which $105 million and $101 million, respectively, were classified as current liabilities.; 0
0001.00198; Pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in 2013, 2012 and 2011 totaled $108 million, $166 million and $9 million, respectively, and are included in “Other charges” in the accompanying consolidated statement of income.; 0
0001.00199; Cash outlays related to environmental remediation retained by PPG were $120 million, $62 million, and $48 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.; 0
0001.00200; In addition to the amounts currently reserved for environmental remediation, the Company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters now estimated to be approximately $100 million to $200 million which is lower than the estimate of $100 million to $275 million as of December 31, 2012 as a result of the additional environmental remediation charge recorded in the third quarter of 2013 explained below and the separation of the commodity chemicals business.; 0
0001.00201; Such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence.; 0
0001.00202; These reasonably possible unreserved losses relate to environmental matters at a number of sites, including about one third each related to the following: i) additional costs at New Jersey Chrome ii) legacy glass sites and iii) a number of other sites, including legacy chemical manufacturing sites.; 0
0001.00203; The loss contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them.The Company continues to analyze, assess and remediate the environmental issues associated with New Jersey Chrome. During the third quarter of 2013, PPG completed an assessment of costs incurred to date versus current progress, and the potential cost impacts of recently acquired information, including but not limited to the extent of impacted soils, percentage of hazardous versus non-hazardous soils, daily soil excavation rates, and engineering, administrative and other associated costs.; 0
0001.00204; Based on this assessment, a reserve adjustment of $89 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2013.; 0
0001.00205; A charge of $145 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2012 as a result of updated information the Company compiled about the sites that was used to develop a new estimate of the cost to remediate these sites.; 1
0001.00206; The updated information was compiled in connection with the preparation of a final draft soil remedial action work plan and cost estimate.; 0
0001.00207; The charges for estimated environmental remediation costs in 2013 and 2012 were significantly higher than PPG’s historical range.; 0
0001.00208; Excluding the charges related to the New Jersey Chrome sites, pretax charges against income for environmental remediation have ranged between $10 million and $30 million per year for the past 10 years.; 0
0001.00209; There are currently no amounts for groundwater remediation in our environmental reserves as of December 31, 2013.; 0
0001.00210; Information will continue to be generated from the ongoing groundwater remedial investigation activities related to New Jersey Chrome and will be incorporated into a final draft remedial action work plan for groundwater expected to be submitted to NJDEP in 2014.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesDuring the past three years, we have had sufficient financial resources to meet our operating requirements, to fund our capital spending, share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to our shareholders.262013 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-KTable of ContentsCash from continuing operating activities was $1,809 million, $1,576 million, and $1,176 million in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.; 0
0001.00211; Cash from operations in 2013 compared to 2012 was aided by higher income from continuing operations which was driven by income from acquired businesses.; 1
0001.00212; Cash from operations in 2012 compared to 2011 was aided by cash received from a decrease in working capital.Operating Working Capital is a subset of total working capital and represents (1) trade receivables-net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, plus (2) inventories on a first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) basis, less (3) trade creditors’ liabilities.; 0

0001.00242; We did not make a voluntary contribution to these plans in 2012.; 0
0001.00243; We do not expect to have a mandatory contribution to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2014.; 0
0001.00244; We made contributions to our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans of $124 million, $80 million and $70 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, some of which were required by local funding requirements.; 0
0001.00245; We expect 2013 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 27Table of Contentsto make mandatory contributions to our non-U.S. plans in 2014 in the range of approximately $10 million to $25 million.In September 2012, PPG entered into a five-year credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with several banks and financial institutions as further discussed in Note 8, Debt and Bank Credit Agreements and Leases.; 0
0001.00246; The Credit Agreement provides for a $1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility.; 0

0001.00251; The 2022 Notes were offered by the Company pursuant to its existing shelf registration statement.; 0
0001.00252; The proceeds of this offering of $397 million, net of discount and issuance costs, were used to repay a portion of the $600 million of 5.75% notes in March 2013 (the 2013 Notes”).; 0
0001.00253; The discount and issuance costs related to the 2022 Notes, which totaled $3 million, are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2022 Notes.; 0
0001.00254; Also during the year ended December 31, 2012 the Company assumed $120 million of debt in the Dyrup acquisition repaid $119 million of that debt, and repaid the $71 million of 6.875% notes upon their maturity.In June 2011, the Company repaid a $400 million three year unsecured term loan, which had a scheduled maturity date of June 2012.

0001.00256; These amounts relate to approximately 200 subsidiaries in more than 60 taxable jurisdictions. Substantially no deferred U.S. income taxes have been provided on these earnings as they are considered to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time or will be repatriated when it is tax effective to do so.; 0
0001.00257; The Company estimates repatriation of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 would have resulted in a U.S. tax cost of approximately $250 million and $110 million, respectively.; 0
0001.00258; We continue to believe that our cash and short term investments on hand, cash from operations and the Company’s available debt capacity will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital spending, including acquisitions, dividend payments, debt service, amounts due under the proposed asbestos settlement, share repurchases, contributions to pension plans, and PPG’s significant contractual obligations.; 0

0001.00265; However, PPG has no obligation to pay any amounts under this settlement until the Funding Effective Date, as more fully discussed in Note 14, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.At December 31, 2013, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits, was approximately $94 million. The timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities.; 0
0001.00266; PPG does not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year.; 0
0001.00267; The Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur.The unconditional purchase commitments are principally take-or-pay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials, including industrial gases, natural gas, coal and electricity, consistent with customary industry practice.; 0
0001.00268; See Note 8, “Debt and Bank Credit Agreements and Leases,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit, letters of credit, guarantees and debt covenants.In addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit, the Company has an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC pursuant to which it may issue, offer and sell from time to time on a continuous or delayed basis any combination of securities in one or more offerings.282013 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-KTable of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase commitments disclosed in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in Note 8, “Debt and Bank Credit Agreements and Leases,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Critical Accounting EstimatesManagement has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under Item 8 of this Form 10-K and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate.; 0
0001.00269; We believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies, under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, and to accounting for pensions, other postretirement benefits, business combinations, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies.ContingenciesContingencies, by their nature, relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss.; 0
0001.00270; The most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectability of accounts receivable, to environmental remediation, to pending, impending or overtly threatened litigation against the Company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years. For more information on these matters, see Note 3, “Working Capital Detail,” Note 12, “Income Taxes” and Note 14, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit PlansAccounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works.; 0
0001.00271; To accomplish this, extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, turnover, medical costs and discount rates. The Company has established a process by which management reviews and selects these assumptions annually.; 0
0001.00272; See Note 13, “Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits,” under Item 8 for information on these plans and the assumptions used.The discount rate used in accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits is determined by reference to a current yield curve and by considering the timing and amount of projected future benefit payments.; 0
0001.00273; The weighted average discount rate assumption at December 31, 2013 and for 2014 is 4.83% for our U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans.; 0
0001.00274; A change in the discount rate of 100 basis points, with all other assumptions held constant, would impact 2014 net periodic benefit expense for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately $18 million and $9 million, respectively.; 0
0001.00275; The expected return on plan assets assumption used in accounting for our pension plans is determined by evaluating the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and external forecasts of future long-term investment returns.; 0
0001.00276; For 2013, the return on plan assets assumption for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans was 7.25% and will remain the same for 2014. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would impact 2014 net periodic pension expense by approximately $27 million.Business Combinations In accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations, the Company used the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition.; 0
0001.00277; The excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized as goodwill.; 0
0001.00278; The valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results.; 0
0001.00279; In addition to using management estimates and negotiated amounts, the Company used a variety of information sources to determine the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including: third-party appraisals for the estimated value and lives of identifiable intangible assets and property, plant and equipment third-party actuaries for the estimated obligations of defined benefit pension plans and similar benefit obligations and legal counsel or other experts to assess the obligations associated with legal, environmental and other contingent liabilities.; 0
0001.00280; The business and technical judgment of management was used in determining which intangible assets have indefinite lives and in determining the useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsAs discussed in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K, the Company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually.; 0
0001.00281; Intangibles are tested for impairment using a quantitative impairment model.; 0
0001.00282; The Company tests goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a two-step quantitative test.; 0
0001.00283; The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors, including reporting unit specific operating results as well as industry, market and general economic conditions, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill.; 0
0001.00284; The Company may elect to bypass this qualitative assessment for some or all of its reporting units and perform a two-step quantitative test.; 0
0001.00285; Fair values under the quantitative test are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows.; 0
0001.00286; Based on the 2013 impairment tests, none of our goodwill or identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives was impaired.We believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K related to these contingencies, pensions, other postretirement benefits, business combinations, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and 2013 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 29Table of Contentsjudgments of the appropriate PPG management, although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates.CurrencyFrom December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013, the U.S. dollar strengthened against certain currencies in the countries in which PPG operates, while weakening against others, the most notable being the Euro. As a result, consolidated net assets at December 31, 2013 decreased by $44 million, compared to December 31, 2012.; 1
0001.00287; Comparing exchange rates during 2013 to those of 2012, in the countries in which PPG operates, the U.S. dollar was weaker in certain countries, which had a favorable impact on full year 2013 income before income taxes of $11 million from the translation of these foreign earnings into U.S. dollars.The U.S. dollar weakened from year-end December 31, 2011 to year-end December 31, 2012, against certain currencies in the countries in which PPG operates, most notably against the Euro, the British pound sterling, Polish zloty, and the South Korean won.; 0
0001.00288; A $141 million increase in PPG consolidated net assets and shareholders equity resulted from translating PPG’s foreign denominated net assets to U.S. dollars at December 31, 2012, compared to December 31, 2011.; 1
0001.00289; Comparing exchange rates during 2012 to those of 2011, in the countries in which PPG operates, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger, particularly against the Euro, which had an unfavorable impact on full year 2012 income before income taxes of approximately $40 million from the translation of these foreign earnings into U.S. dollars.From December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011, the U.S. dollar strengthened against the currencies of most of the countries in which PPG operates, most notably against the Euro, the Brazilian real, and the Polish zloty.; 0
0001.00290; A $188 million decrease in PPG consolidated net assets and shareholders' equity resulted from translating PPG’s foreign denominated net assets to U.S. dollars at December 31, 2011, compared to December 31, 2010.; 1
0001.00291; However, during much of 2011, the U.S. dollar was weaker against the currencies of many countries in which PPG operates than it was in 2010, which had a favorable impact on 2011 income before income taxes of approximately $40 million from the translation of these foreign earnings into U.S. dollars.Forward-Looking StatementsThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.; 0
0001.00292; Management’s Discussion and Analysis and other sections of this Annual Report contain forward-looking statements that reflect the Company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance.You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to current or historic facts.; 0
0001.00293; Forward-looking statements are identified by the use of the words “aim,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “project,” “outlook,” “forecast” and other expressions that indicate future events and trends.; 0
0001.00294; Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by applicable law.; 0
0001.00295; You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission.; 0
0001.00296; Also, note the following cautionary statements.Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company’s forward-looking statements.; 0
0001.00297; Such factors include global economic conditions, increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors, fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom, economic and political conditions in international markets, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, fluctuations in tax rates, the impact of future legislation, the impact of environmental regulations, unexpected business disruptions, the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation, including litigation that could result if the proposed asbestos settlement does not become effective, the realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring initiatives, the effect of the sale of the Company's 51% ownership interest in Transitions Optical, PPG's ability to integrate the North American architectural coatings business acquisition and to achieve anticipated synergies.; 0
0001.00298; However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.; 0
0001.00299; Consequently, while the list of factors presented here and under Item 1A is considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.; 0
0001.00300; Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements.This Annual Report also contains statements about PPG’s agreement to sell its 51% ownership interest in Transitions Optical and its sunlens business to Essilor International (the Transaction) and the expected effects of the Transaction on PPG and Transitions Optical.; 0
0001.00301; Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company’s forward-looking statements with respect to the Transaction, including the parties’ ability to satisfy the conditions to the closing of the Transaction the parties’ ability to complete the Transaction on anticipated terms and schedule risks relating to the ability of the parties to obtain regulatory approvals for the Transaction any unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, additional indebtedness, or losses and the risk that disruptions from the Transaction will harm PPG’s business.Consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties, other factors set forth in Item 1A of this Form 10-K and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.Item 7A.; 0
0001.00302; Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskPPG is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and natural gas prices and to changes in PPG’s stock price.; 0
0001.00303; The Company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to 302013 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-KTable of Contentsmanage or reduce these market risks.; 0
0001.00304; A detailed description of these exposures and the Company’s risk management policies are provided in Note 10, “Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.The following disclosures summarize PPG’s exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks.; 0
0001.00305; Quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible, unfavorable changes in market rates can impact PPG’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position.Foreign Currency RiskWe conduct operations in many countries around the world.; 0
0001.00306; Our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction and currency translation risk.; 0
0001.00307; Foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding during 2013 and 2012 were used to hedge PPG’s exposure to foreign currency transaction risk.; 0
0001.00308; The fair value of these contracts as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 were insignificant.; 0
0001.00309; The potential reduction in PPG’s income from continuing operations resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for European currencies and 20% for Asian and South American currencies for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 would have been $9 million and $14 million, respectively.In 2008, PPG entered into U.S. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of $1.16 billion, of which $600 million were to settle on March 15, 2013 and $560 million were to settle on March 15, 2018.; 0
0001.00310; In June 2012, $600 million of the swaps, with a settlement date of March 15, 2013, were settled with PPG receiving $1 million in cash.; 0
0001.00311; On settlement of the remaining outstanding contracts, PPG will receive $560 million U.S. dollars and pay euros to the counterparties to the contracts.; 0
0001.00312; During the term of these contracts, PPG will receive semiannual payments in March and September of each year based on U.S. dollar, long-term fixed interest rates, and PPG will make annual payments in March of each year to the counterparties based on euro, long-term fixed interest rates.; 0
0001.00313; The Company designated all of the cross currency swaps as hedges of its net investment in acquired European coatings businesses and, as a result, the mark to fair value adjustments of the swaps outstanding have been and will be recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (Income) (AOCI), and the cash flow impact of these swaps has been and will be classified as investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. As of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of $120 million and $95 million, respectively.; 0
0001.00314; A 10% increase in the value of the euro to the U.S. dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts and increased the liability by $81 million and $84 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.PPG had non-U.S. dollar denominated debt outstanding of $453 million as of December 31, 2013 and $449 million as of December 31, 2012. A weakening of the U.S. dollar by 10% against European currencies and by 20% against Asian and South American currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of approximately $53 million and $51 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.; 0
0001.00315; Interest Rate RiskThe Company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs.; 0
0001.00316; At December 31, 2011, interest rate swaps with a notional value of $445 million converted fixed rate debt to variable rate debt.; 0
0001.00317; During 2012, PPG settled these swaps, receiving $29 million from such settlements.; 0
0001.00318; A 10% increase in interest rates in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in Asia and South America would have affected PPG’s variable rate debt obligations by increasing interest expense approximately $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.; 0
0001.00319; Further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the present value of the Company’s fixed rate debt by approximately $81 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 however, such changes would not have had an effect on PPG’s annual income from continuing operations or cash flows.Equity Price RiskAn equity forward arrangement was entered into to hedge the Company’s exposure to changes in fair value of its future obligation to contribute PPG stock into an asbestos settlement trust (see Note 10 “Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities” and Note 14, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K).; 0
0001.00320; The fair value of this instrument as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 was an asset of $207 million and $130 million, respectively (see Note 9 “Fair Value Measurements”).; 0
0001.00321; A 10% decrease in PPG’s stock price would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of this instrument of $26 million and $19 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.2013 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 31Table of Contents; 0
