0001.00002; MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSFinancial Highlights - 2016 Compared to 2015 Our pre-tax income for 2016 was $6.6 billion, representing a $521 million decrease compared to the prior year as lower passenger revenue and higher salaries and related costs offset the benefits of lower fuel prices.; 1
0001.00003; Pre-tax income, adjusted for special items (a non-GAAP financial measure) was $6.1 billion, an increase of $206 million, or 3.5%.; 0
0001.00004; Special items in 2016 were related to fuel hedge MTM adjustments and settlements and Virgin Atlantic MTM adjustments, which totaled $450 million and $115 million, respectively.Revenue.; 0
0001.00005; Our operating revenue decreased $1.1 billion, or 2.6%, and passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) decreased 4.9% on 2.1% higher capacity compared to 2015. The decrease in PRASM was largely driven by competitive pressure in the current low fuel price environment and the impact of U.S. dollar strength on tickets sold in international markets, which are predominantly priced in local currency.; 1
0001.00006; Operating Expense.; 0
0001.00007; Total operating expense decreased $215 million and our consolidated operating cost per available seat mile (CASM) decreased 2.6% to 12.98 cents compared to 2015, primarily due to lower fuel prices, partially offset by higher salaries and related costs.; 1
0001.00008; During 2016, Brent crude oil averaged $44 per barrel compared to the average of nearly $52 per barrel during 2015.; 0
0001.00009; Salaries and related costs were higher as a result of the pay rate increase for pilots resulting from a new pilot contract ratified in the December 2016 quarter that was retroactive to January 1, 2016 and pay rate increases for eligible merit, ground and flight attendant employees effective in the December 2015 quarter.Non-fuel unit costs (CASM-Ex, including profit sharing a non-GAAP financial measure) increased 3.7% to 10.13 cents due to the pay rate increases discussed above and other product and service investments, which were partially offset by productivity gains from our fleet, technology and supply chain initiatives.The non-GAAP financial measures for pre-tax income, adjusted for special items, and CASM-Ex, used above and adjusted net debt, used below, are defined and reconciled in Supplemental Information below.; 1
0001.00010; Company InitiativesOur employees are an important part of Delta's success and underpin the quality, customer service and operational reliability that is core to Delta's brand.; 0
0001.00011; During the December 2016 quarter, Delta pilots ratified a new contract that included an 18% pay rate increase that was retroactive to January 1, 2016. This increase for pilots followed pay rate increases for the majority of other employees during the December 2015 quarter.; 0
0001.00012; In addition, our profit sharing payment to employees in February 2017 will be the third consecutive annual profit sharing payment of more than one billion dollars.; 0
0001.00013; We have paid eligible employees more than $5 billion in profit sharing since the program started in 2007.; 0
0001.00014; We expect to continue to pay our employees industry leading total compensation because sharing the success that our employees help produce is core to Delta's culture and important to providing the best travel experience for our customers and producing solid results for shareholders.Running a reliable, customer-focused airline has produced a solid return on invested capital (ROIC, see calculation in Supplemental Information below) of 26.1% in 2016, despite the pressure from employee investments discussed above.; 1
0001.00015; This financial performance has allowed us to improve our balance sheet by reducing debt and capital lease obligations to $7.3 billion and adjusted net debt (a non-GAAP financial measure) to $6.1 billion, increase funding of our defined benefit pension plans and increase the amount of capital returned to our shareholders.; 1
0001.00016; We are focused on delivering additional value for shareholders in the future through revenue growth, cost productivity and prudent deployment of cash flows.; 1
0001.00017; We have significantly invested in our business since 2010 to improve our operational performance, which consistently ranks first among the major U.S. carriers.; 0
0001.00018; During 2016, we operated 241 days with zero mainline canceled flights, a nearly 50% improvement over our 2015 performance.; 0
0001.00019; In addition, our reported completion factor of 99.6% and on-time arrival rate of nearly 87% places us at the top of the major global U.S. carriers. This operational excellence resulted in consistent increases in our domestic net promoter score, including our highest reported score of 44% in November.Global StrategyWe continue to expand our global network by strengthening our presence in major and developing markets around the world in an effort to increase and diversify our network into high revenue and high growth markets.; 1
0001.00020; The growth of our global presence will enable customers to seamlessly connect to more places while enjoying a consistent, high-quality travel experience.; 0
0001.00021; We are deploying this strategy through investments and relationships in the Atlantic, Latin America and the Pacific.Atlantic.; 0
0001.00022; In 2017, we plan to build on our presence in our strategically advantaged hubs in London, Paris and Amsterdam, while de-emphasizing higher Europe point-of-sale markets.; 0
0001.00023; Alongside our 49% equity investment in Virgin Atlantic, we have an antitrust immunized joint venture with the U.K.-based carrier.; 0
0001.00024; This joint venture has significantly improved our presence in London, one of the largest revenue markets from the U.S., while also enhancing our transatlantic network including our existing joint venture relationship with Air France-KLM and Alitalia.; 0
0001.00025; Our Atlantic senior decision-making functions are located in Europe for close coordination with our joint venture airlines.Latin America.; 0
0001.00026; We are focused on maximizing the value of our relationships with other carriers in Latin America while deriving value from the recent investments in our network, product and service.; 0
0001.00027; During 2015, we announced our intention to create an antitrust immunized commercial joint venture with Aeroméxico and to acquire additional shares of the capital stock of Grupo Aeroméxico through a cash tender offer, both subject to regulatory approvals. The Mexican and U.S. regulators approved antitrust immunity for the joint venture during 2016, subject to certain conditions.; 0
0001.00028; Delta and Aeroméxico have accepted the conditions and are in the process of implementing the necessary actions in order to satisfy the conditions.; 0
0001.00029; We expect both the joint venture to be implemented and the tender offer to be completed in the first half of 2017.; 0
0001.00030; As a result of the tender offer, when combined with our current holdings and derivative positions, we would own up to 49% of the outstanding capital stock of Grupo Aeroméxico.We also own 9.5% of GOL's outstanding capital stock as part of our long-term strategy to strengthen the opportunity we see in Brazil.; 1
0001.00031; In conjunction with our investment, we and GOL have extended our existing commercial agreements.Pacific.; 0
0001.00032; We continue to execute the multi-year restructuring of our Pacific operations by reorienting our network from Tokyo-Narita to Shanghai, through our partnership with China Eastern Airlines, and Seoul, through our partnership with Korean Air.; 0
0001.00033; During 2016, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced that we have been awarded two daytime slot pairs at Tokyo's Haneda Airport (from Los Angeles and Minneapolis).; 0
0001.00034; We commenced these routes and canceled other routes in the Pacific region during the December 2016 quarter. Concurrent with these changes, we are increasing our presence in China, the largest transpacific market from the U.S. We hold a 3.2% stake in China Eastern and are expanding our relationship through co-location in the same terminal at Shanghai’s Pudong airport for a seamless travel experience.; 0
0001.00035; China Eastern is one of the largest airlines in China with a route network covering more than 200 destinations in over 25 countries.; 0
0001.00036; In addition, we are working to expand our trans-Pacific partnership with Korean Air, including expanded codeshare offerings and the commencement of a daily, non-stop flight between Atlanta and Seoul during the June 2017 quarter.Cost Productivity Over the long-term, we continue to focus on maintaining the rate of non-fuel unit cost growth at less than 2% annually.; 0
0001.00037; We continue to leverage our expertise in supply chain and aircraft maintenance to improve our productivity.; 0
0001.00038; Additionally, we are investing in technology projects to improve the customer experience in a cost-efficient manner. We use approximately 50% of our operating cash flow to reinvest in the business for long-term growth opportunities.; 0
0001.00039; The remaining free cash flow is used to further strengthen the balance sheet to reduce debt levels, make incremental pension contributions and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.Investing in our FacilitiesWe are working closely with airport authorities throughout our network to enhance facilities in order to both improve our operational efficiency and to better serve our customers.; 0
0001.00040; These efforts include, but are not limited to, future airport renovation and redevelopment projects at New York-LaGuardia airport, Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and the recently-completed redevelopment of New York-JFK airport. In addition, we are modernizing our Sky Clubs, including the recent openings of flagship locations in Atlanta and Seattle, and improving the food, beverage and services offered throughout the Sky Club network.; 0
0001.00041; Finally, we continue to make significant investments in technologies that improve the customer experience including delta.com, mobile device applications, check-in kiosks, employee customer service applications and airport information displays.Strengthened Balance SheetA key tenet of our strategy is to operate the company with investment grade financial metrics.; 0
0001.00042; Since beginning our balance sheet improvement strategy in 2009, we have reduced our adjusted net debt by nearly $11 billion, which has significantly reduced our annual interest expense. As a result of these efforts, we have received upgrades to our credit ratings by all three major ratings agencies, including investment grade ratings from Moody's and Fitch.; 1
0001.00043; In addition, because we have a significant net underfunded pension liability, we have been making pension contributions above the minimum amount required.; 1
0001.00044; Our goal remains to achieve at least an 80% funded status for the pension plan by 2020.Increased Capital Returns to OwnersWhile we have been reducing our debt levels and investing in the business, we have been increasing our capital returns to shareholders, returning a total of $3.1 billion in 2016 through dividends and share repurchases.; 0
0001.00045; Since first implementing our quarterly dividend in 2013, we have increased the dividend per share by 50% annually and paid $1.2 billion in total dividends, including $509 million in 2016. Through dividends and share repurchases, we have returned nearly $7.4 billion to shareholders since 2013, while reducing outstanding shares by approximately 14% compared to the beginning of 2013.; 0

0001.00047; PRASM decreased 4.9% and passenger mile yield decreased 4.5% on 2.1% higher capacity.; 0
0001.00048; Load factor was 0.3 points lower than the prior year at 84.6%.; 0
0001.00049; Unit revenues of the domestic region decreased 5.2%, resulting from weakness in the close-in yield environment during most of the year despite strong volume.Revenues related to our international regions decreased 7.2% year-over-year primarily due to yield declines resulting from imbalances between supply and demand, principally in the Atlantic region and China, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, continued reductions in international fuel surcharges and economic challenges in certain regions.In the Atlantic, the unit revenue decline predominantly resulted from lower yields driven by industry capacity growthoutpacing passenger demand and the strength of the U.S. dollar.; 1
0001.00050; In core European markets, U.S. point-of-sale demand was strong and recovered quickly following the Brussels airport terrorist attack in March.; 0
0001.00051; However, Europe point-of sale demand has been soft largely due to the impact of weaker Euro exchange rates.; 1
0001.00052; In 2017, we will continue to build on our presence in our strategically advantaged hubs in London, Paris and Amsterdam.Unit revenue declines in the Pacific compared to 2015 primarily resulted from lower yen hedge gains, lower international fuel surcharges and yield declines resulting from industry capacity growth between the U.S. and China.; 1
0001.00053; We expect the significant capacity growth over the last three years in the U.S. to Shanghai market to slow in 2017 as both Chinese and U.S. carriers reach their respective frequency caps. During the September 2016 quarter, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced that we have been awarded two daytime slot pairs at Tokyo's Haneda Airport (from Los Angeles and Minneapolis).; 0
0001.00054; We commenced these routes and canceled other routes in the Pacific region during the December 2016 quarter as part of our ongoing optimization of the Pacific region.; 0
0001.00055; We expect these positive trends to continue in 2017 as we continue to invest in higher performing Mexican business markets.; 0
0001.00056; For a discussion of charges recorded in restructuring and other, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Salaries and Related Costs.; 0
0001.00057; The increase in salaries and related costs was principally due to pay rate increases given to eligible employees which includes an 18% pay rate increase for pilots resulting from a new pilot contract ratified in the December 2016 quarter that was retroactive to January 1, 2016.; 1
0001.00058; Additionally, in the December 2015 quarter, base pay rates increased 14.5% for eligible merit, ground and flight attendant employees in conjunction with changes in their profit sharing program.; 0
0001.00059; Including our regional carriers, fuel expense decreased $1.6 billion compared to the prior year due to an 18% decrease in the market price per gallon of fuel and lower fuel hedge losses, partially offset by a loss from our refinery segment in the current year compared to a profit in the prior year and a 0.7% increase in consumption.; 1
0001.00060; (2) Includes the impact of pricing arrangements between the airline and refinery segments with respect to the refinery's inventory price risk.; 0
0001.00061; For additional information regarding the refinery segment impact, see Refinery Segment below.; 0
0001.00062; (3) MTM adjustments and settlements include the effects of the derivative transactions discussed in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.; 0
0001.00063; For additional information and the reason for adjusting fuel expense, see Supplemental Information below.Regional Carriers Expense.; 0
0001.00064; The increase in regional carriers expense was primarily due to increases in aircraft maintenance and scheduled contract carrier rate escalations, partially offset by lower fuel cost from the decrease in the market price of fuel.Contracted Services.; 0
0001.00065; The increase in contracted services expense predominantly related to costs associated with the 2.1% increase in capacity and additional temporary staffing.Profit Sharing.; 1
0001.00066; The decrease in profit sharing was primarily due to an adjustment to the profit sharing calculation.; 0
0001.00067; Our broad-based employee profit sharing program provides that, for each year in which we have an annual pre-tax profit, as defined by the terms of the program, we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees.; 0
0001.00068; In determining the amount of profit sharing, the program defines profit as pre-tax profit adjusted for profit sharing and certain other items.; 0
0001.00069; Beginning with 2016 (to be paid out in 2017), the profit sharing program for merit, ground and flight attendant employees was adjusted to pay 10% of annual pre-tax profit (as defined by the terms of the program) and, if we exceed our prior-year results, the program will pay 20% of the year-over-year increase in pre-tax profit to eligible employees.; 1
0001.00070; For years prior to 2016, our profit sharing program paid 10% to all eligible employees for the first $2.5 billion of annual profit and 20% of annual profit above $2.5 billion.; 0
0001.00071; The profit sharing program for pilots remains unchanged from the prior year and will continue under its current terms.; 0

0001.00073; Load factor was 0.2 points higher than the prior year at 84.9%.Unit revenues of the mainline domestic region decreased 0.6%, resulting from weaker yields in certain markets, which were nearly offset by the strong performance in Atlanta, New York, Seattle and Los Angeles.Regional carriers passenger revenue decreased 6.1% on a 4.0% reduction in capacity.; 1
0001.00074; During 2015, we removed thirty 50-seat regional aircraft as part of our strategy to restructure our domestic fleet.Revenues related to our international regions decreased 6.0% year-over-year primarily due to the impact of the strong U.S. dollar and reductions in international fuel surcharges. These challenges were addressed through capacity reductions implemented in the December 2015 quarter.In the Atlantic region, unit revenue declines in Africa, the Middle East and Russia were partially offset by strength in core European markets.; 1
0001.00075; Unit revenue declines in the Pacific primarily resulted from the strength of the U.S. dollar and lower international fuel surcharges.; 1
0001.00076; We continued to optimize the Pacific region in order to improve margins by reducing our winter capacity, including the cancellation of our Seattle to Tokyo-Haneda route in the June 2015 quarter and downgauging via the continued retirement of the B-747-400 fleet during the second half of 2015.; 0
0001.00077; In addition, we made a strategic investment in, and established a long-term commercial relationship with, China Eastern.; 0
0001.00078; Latin America saw capacity growth of 5.7%, the majority of which occurred during the first half of 2015.; 0
0001.00079; In the December 2015 quarter, we continued to invest in higher performing markets such as Mexico and the Caribbean, while reducing capacity in Brazil due to its challenging economic environment.; 0
0001.00080; For a discussion of charges recorded in restructuring and other, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Salaries and Related Costs.; 0
0001.00081; The increase in salaries and related costs was primarily due to higher pilot and flight attendant block hours and pay rate increases implemented in both the first half of 2015 and December 2015.; 1
0001.00082; Base pay rates increased 14.5% for eligible merit, ground and flight attendant employees effective December 1, 2015.Aircraft Fuel and Related Taxes.; 0
0001.00083; Including our regional carriers, fuel expense decreased $5.9 billion compared to the prior year due to a 43.5% decrease in the market price per gallon of fuel, an increase in Monroe's profitability and reduced hedge losses, partially offset by a 2.4% increase in consumption. 34Table of ContentsThe table below shows the impact of hedging and the refinery on fuel expense and average price per gallon, adjusted: Average Price Per Gallon Year Ended December 31,Increase(Decrease) Year Ended December 31,Increase(Decrease)(in millions, except per gallon data)20152014 20152014Fuel purchase cost(1)$6,934$11,350$(4,416) $1.74$2.91$(1.17)Airline segment fuel hedge losses(2)9352,258(1,323) 0.230.58(0.35)Refinery segment impact(2)(290)(96)(194) (0.07)(0.02)(0.05)Total fuel expense$7,579$13,512$(5,933) $1.90$3.47$(1.57)MTM adjustments and settlements(3)1,301(2,346)3,647 0.33(0.60)0.93Total fuel expense, adjusted$8,880$11,166$(2,286) $2.23$2.87$(0.64) (1) Market price for jet fuel at airport locations, including related taxes and transportation costs.; 0

0001.00086; (3) MTM adjustments and settlements include the effects of the derivative transactions discussed in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.; 0
0001.00087; For additional information and the reason for adjusting fuel expense, see Supplemental Information below.Regional Carriers Expense.; 0
0001.00088; The reduction in regional carriers expense was primarily due to lower fuel cost from a decrease in the price per gallon of fuel, lower capacity and reduced maintenance expenses.; 1
0001.00089; During 2015, we removed thirty 50-seatregional aircraft as part of our strategy to restructure our domestic fleet.Contracted Services.; 0
0001.00090; The increase in contracted services expense predominantly related to costs associated with the 3.0% increase in capacity and additional temporary staffing.Depreciation and Amortization.; 1
0001.00091; Depreciation and amortization expense increased year-over-year primarily due to investments in new A330-300, B-737-900ER and CRJ-900 aircraft and aircraft modifications that upgraded aircraft interiors and enhanced our product offering.Landing Fees and Other Rents.; 1
0001.00092; Landing fees and other rents increased principally due to an increased number of departures and higher rental rates.Profit Sharing.; 1
0001.00093; The increase in profit sharing was driven by an increase in full year pre-tax income compared to the prior year.; 1
0001.00094; Our broad-based employee profit sharing program provides that, for each year in which we have an annual pre-tax profit, as defined by the terms of the program, we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees.; 0
0001.00095; In determining the amount of profit sharing, the program defines profit as pre-tax profit adjusted for profit sharing and certain other items.; 0
0001.00096; For years prior to 2016, our profit sharing program paid 10% to all employees for the first $2.5 billion of annual profit and 20% of annual profit above $2.5 billion.Beginning with 2016 pre-tax profit (to be paid out in 2017), the profit sharing program for merit, ground and flight attendant employees has been adjusted to pay 10% of annual pre-tax profit (as defined by the terms of the program) and, if we exceed our prior-year results, the program will pay 20% of the year-over-year increase in pre-tax profit to eligible employees.; 1
0001.00097; The profit sharing program for pilots remained unchanged and will continue in 2016 under its terms.Passenger Service.; 0
0001.00098; Passenger service expense includes the costs for onboard food and beverage, cleaning and supplies.; 0
0001.00099; This expense increased year-over-year primarily due to costs associated with enhancements to our onboard product offering and the 3.3% increase in traffic.Other.; 1
0001.00100; Other operating expense increased primarily due to costs associated with sales of non-jet fuel products to third parties by our oil refinery.; 0
0001.00101; The principal amount of debt and capital leases has declined from $11.7 billion at the beginning of 2014 to $7.4 billion at December 31, 2016.; 0
0001.00102; Miscellaneous, net was favorable primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses compared to 2015. Also contributing to the increase is our proportionate share of earnings from our equity investment in Virgin Atlantic.; 1
0001.00103; The increase from Virgin Atlantic primarily resulted from year-over-year profit and improvements in MTM adjustments on fuel hedges.; 1
0001.00104; In 2015, miscellaneous, net was favorable primarily due to a reduction in debt extinguishment losses together with year-over-year profits and improvements in MTM adjustments on fuel hedges from Virgin Atlantic compared to 2014.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate for 2016 was 34.1%.; 1
0001.00105; We expect our annual effective tax rate to be between 34% and 35% for 2017.; 0
0001.00106; The reduction in our rate from prior years was primarily related to differences in our global tax rates.; 1
0001.00107; At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $5.9 billion of U.S. federal pre-tax net operating loss carryforwards, which do not begin to expire until 2027. Accordingly, we believe we will not pay any cash federal income taxes before 2019.; 1
0001.00108; See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.; 0
0001.00109; Refinery SegmentThe refinery primarily produces gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.; 0
0001.00110; Monroe exchanges the non-jet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations.; 0
0001.00111; The jet fuel produced and procured through exchanging gasoline and diesel fuel produced by the refinery provided approximately 175,000 barrels per day for use in our airline operations during 2016. We believe that the jet fuel supply resulting from the refinery's operation has contributed to the reduction in the market price of jet fuel, and thus lowered our cost of jet fuel compared to what it otherwise would have been.The refinery recorded operating revenues of $3.8 billion in 2016, compared to $4.7 billion in 2015.; 1
0001.00112; Operating revenues in 2016 were primarily composed of $2.7 billion of non-jet fuel products exchanged with third parties to procure jet fuel and $695 million of sales of jet fuel to the airline segment.; 0
0001.00113; Refinery revenues decreased compared to the prior year due to an oversupply of crude in the market, which drove lower pricing of refined products throughout the oil industry.The refinery recorded a loss of $125 million in 2016, compared to profits of $290 million and $96 million recorded in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The refinery's loss in 2016, compared to profits in the preceding two years, was primarily due to higher RINs costs and lower distillate crack spreads.A refinery is subject to annual EPA requirements to blend renewable fuels into the gasoline and on-road diesel fuel it produces.; 1
0001.00114; Alternatively, a refinery may purchase renewable energy credits, called RINs, from third parties in the secondary market.; 0
0001.00115; Because the refinery, operated by Monroe, does not blend renewable fuels, it has purchased its entire RINs requirement in the secondary market.; 0
0001.00116; We recognized $171 million, $75 million and $111 million of expense related to the RINs requirement in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.; 0
0001.00117; RINs expense increased during 2016 primarily as a result of a significant increase in the unit cost of RINs from approximately 58 cents per RIN during 2015 to 84 cents per RIN during 2016.; 1
0001.00118; For more information regarding the refinery's results, see Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.; 0
0001.00119; As of December 31, 2016, we had $5.7 billion in unrestricted liquidity, consisting of $3.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and $2.5 billion in undrawn revolving credit facilities.; 0
0001.00120; During 2016, we generated $7.2 billion in cash from operating activities, which we used to fund capital expenditures of $3.4 billion, return $3.1 billion to shareholders and reduce the principal on our debt and capital lease obligations by $1.3 billion.Sources of LiquidityOperating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities continue to provide our primary source of liquidity.; 0
0001.00121; We generated positive cash flows from operations of $7.2 billion in 2016, $7.9 billion in 2015 and $4.9 billion in 2014. We also expect to generate positive cash flows from operations in 2017.Our operating cash flows can be impacted by the following factors:Seasonality of Advance Ticket Sales.; 0
0001.00122; We sell tickets for air travel in advance of the customer's travel date.; 0
0001.00123; When we receive a cash payment at the time of sale, we record the cash received on advance sales as deferred revenue in air traffic liability.; 0
0001.00124; The air traffic liability increases during the winter and spring as advanced ticket sales grow prior to the summer peak travel season and decreases during the summer and fall months.Fuel and Fuel Hedge Margins. Including our regional carriers, fuel expense represented 18.3% of our total operating expenses for 2016. The market price for jet fuel is highly volatile, which can impact the comparability of our cash flows from operations from period to period.As part of our fuel hedging program, we may be required to post margin to counterparties when our portfolio is in a loss position.; 0
0001.00125; Conversely, if our portfolio with counterparties is in a gain position, we may receive margin.; 0
0001.00126; Our future cash flows are impacted by the nature of our derivative contracts and the market price of the commodities underlying those derivative contracts.; 0
0001.00127; Our hedge contracts were in a net loss position at December 31, 2016 and 2015, resulting in $38 million and $119 million, respectively, of margin postings to counterparties.Timing of SkyMiles Sales.; 1
0001.00128; In December 2011, we amended our American Express agreements and agreed to sell $675 million of unrestricted SkyMiles to American Express in each December from 2011 through 2014.; 0
0001.00129; Pursuant to the December 2011 amendment, American Express purchased $675 million of unrestricted SkyMiles in each of those years with the final payment in 2014.; 0
0001.00130; The SkyMiles purchased in December 2014 were utilized by American Express in 2015.; 0
0001.00131; There were no advanced sales of SkyMiles in 2015 or 2016.Pension Contributions. We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees.; 0
0001.00132; These plans are closed to new entrants and are frozen for future benefit accruals.; 0
0001.00133; Our funding obligations for these plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as modified by the Pension Protection Act of 2006.; 0
0001.00134; In 2016, we contributed $1.3 billion, including $950 million in cash and shares of our common stock from treasury with a value of $350 million, to our qualified defined benefit pension plans during the first half of 2016. As a result of these contributions, we satisfied, on an accelerated basis, our 2016 required contributions for our defined benefit plans, including more than $750 million above the minimum funding requirements.; 1
0001.00135; We contributed $1.2 billion and $917 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.; 0
0001.00136; We estimate our funding under these plans will total at least $1.2 billion in 2017, including $700 million above the minimum funding requirements.Profit Sharing. Our broad-based employee profit sharing program provides that, for each year in which we have an annual pre-tax profit, as defined by the terms of the program, we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees. In determining the amount of profit sharing, the program defines profit as pre-tax profit adjusted for profit sharing and certain other items.; 0
0001.00137; During the year ended December 2016, we recorded $1.1 billion in profit sharing expense based on 2016 pre-tax profit, which will be paid to employees in February 2017.Beginning with 2016 (to be paid out in 2017), the profit sharing program for merit, ground and flight attendant employees was adjusted to pay 10% of annual pre-tax profit (as defined by the terms of the program) and, if we exceed our prior-year results, the program will pay 20% of the year-over-year increase in pre-tax profit to eligible employees.; 0
0001.00138; For years prior to 2016, our profit sharing program paid 10% to all eligible employees for the first $2.5 billion of annual profit and 20% of annual profit above $2.5 billion. The profit sharing program for pilots remains unchanged from the prior year and will continue under its current terms.; 0
0001.00139; Investing Activities Capital Expenditures. Our capital expenditures were $3.4 billion in 2016, $2.9 billion in 2015 and $2.2 billion in 2014.; 0
0001.00140; Our capital expenditures during 2016 were primarily related to the purchase of B-737-900ER aircraft to replace a portion of our older B-757-200 aircraft, purchases of A321-200 and A330-300 aircraft, advanced deposit payments on future aircraft order commitments and seat density projects for our domestic fleet.; 0
0001.00141; Our capital expenditures during 2015 and 2014 were primarily for the purchase of aircraft and modifications to upgrade aircraft interiors that enhance our product offering.We have committed to future aircraft purchases that will require significant capital investment and have obtained long-term financing commitments for a substantial portion of the purchase price of these aircraft.; 0
0001.00142; We expect that we will invest approximately $3.5 billion in 2017 primarily for (a) aircraft, including deliveries of B-737-900ERs, A321-200s and A350-900s, along with advance deposit payments for these and our new A330-900neo and CS100 orders as well as for (b) aircraft modifications, the majority of which relate to increasing the seat density and enhancing the cabins on our domestic fleet.; 0
0001.00143; We expect that the 2017 investments will be funded primarily through cash flows from operations.Equity Investments.; 0
0001.00144; We own 4.2% of the outstanding shares of Grupo Aeroméxico, and we have derivative contracts that may be settled for shares of Grupo Aeroméxico.; 0
0001.00145; Our total derivative contract holdings represent 12.8% of Grupo Aeroméxico's shares.; 0
0001.00146; During 2015, we announced our intention to create an antitrust immunized commercial joint venture with Aeroméxico and to acquire additional shares of the capital stock of Grupo Aeroméxico through a cash tender offer, both subject to regulatory approvals.; 0
0001.00147; The Mexican and U.S. regulators approved antitrust immunity for the joint venture during 2016, subject to certain conditions.; 0
0001.00148; Delta and Aeroméxico have accepted the conditions and are in the process of implementing the necessary actions in order to satisfy the conditions.; 0
0001.00149; We expect both the joint venture to be implemented and the tender offer to be completed in the first half of 2017.; 0
0001.00150; As a result of the tender offer, when combined with our current holdings and derivative positions, we would own up to 49% of the outstanding capital stock of Grupo Aeroméxico.; 1
0001.00151; The total amount to be paid for the tender offer shares and the shares underlying the derivatives is expected to be up to $765 million. LAX Redevelopment.; 0
0001.00152; During the September 2016 quarter, we executed a new lease agreement with Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA), which owns and operates LAX, and announced plans to modernize, upgrade and connect Terminals 2 and 3 at LAX over the next seven years.; 0
0001.00153; Based on the lease agreement, we will design and manage the construction of the initial investment of $350 million to renovate gate areas, support space and other amenities for passengers, upgrade the baggage handling systems in the terminals and facilitate the relocation of those airlines currently located in Terminals 2 and 3 to Terminals 5, 6 and Tom Bradley International Terminal (TBIT).; 0
0001.00154; Subject to required approvals, we have an option to expand the project, which could cost an additional $1.5 billion and would include (1) redevelopment of Terminal 3 and enhancement of Terminal 2, (2) rebuild of the ticketing, arrival hall and security checkpoint, (3) construction of infrastructure for the planned airport people mover (4) ramp improvements and (5) construction of a secure connector to the north side of TBIT.; 0
0001.00155; We expect a substantial majority of the project costs will be funded by a quasi-governmental entity. The principal amount of debt and capital leases has declined from $11.7 billion at the beginning of 2014 to $7.4 billion at December 31, 2016.; 0
0001.00156; Since December 31, 2009, we have reduced our principal amount of debt and capital leases by $10.9 billion.; 0
0001.00157; We have focused on reducing our total debt in recent years as part of our strategy to strengthen our balance sheet. As a result, we received upgrades to our credit ratings by all three major rating agencies, including investment grade ratings from Moody's and Fitch.; 1
0001.00158; Continued improvement in our credit ratings could result in lower costs of borrowing, among other benefits.; 1
0001.00159; The Senior Secured Credit Facilities consist of a $1.5 billion Revolving Credit Facility and a $500 million Term Loan Facility.Capital Returns to Shareholders.; 0
0001.00160; Since 2013, our Board of Directors has implemented three programs to return capital to shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases.; 0
0001.00161; Since first implementing our quarterly dividend in 2013, we have increased the dividend per share by 50% annually and paid $1.2 billion in total dividends, including $509 million in 2016.; 0
0001.00162; Through dividends and share repurchases, we have returned nearly $7.4 billion to shareholders since 2013, while reducing outstanding shares by approximately 14% compared to the beginning of 2013.; 0
0001.00163; During 2016 alone, we repurchased and retired 60 million shares at a cost of $2.6 billion.; 0
0001.00164; During 2015, we effectively deferred settlement of a portion of our hedge portfolio until 2016 by entering into fuel derivative transactions that, excluding market movements from the date of inception, settled and provided approximately $300 million in cash receipts during the second half of 2015 and required approximately $300 million in cash payments in 2016.; 0
0001.00165; We early terminated certain of these deferral transactions in 2015. As a result, we reported $429 million in cash receipts and $71 million in cash payments associated with these deferral transactions in 2015.During the March 2016 quarter, we entered into transactions to further defer settlement of a portion of our hedge portfolio until 2017.; 1
0001.00166; These deferral transactions, excluding market movements from the date of inception, provided approximately $300 million in cash receipts during the second half of 2016 and require approximately $300 million in cash payments in 2017.; 0
0001.00167; During the June 2016 quarter, we early terminated certain of our outstanding deferral transactions and made cash payments of $170 million, including normal settlements. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we reported $291 million in cash receipts and $451 million in cash payments associated with these transactions.; 1
0001.00168; For additional information regarding these deferral transactions, see Note 4 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.; 0
0001.00169; Our credit facilities have covenants, including minimum collateral coverage ratios.; 0
0001.00170; If we are not in compliance with these covenants, we may be required to repay amounts borrowed under the credit facilities or we may not be able to draw on them.; 0
0001.00171; We currently have a substantial amount of unencumbered assets available to pledge as collateral.Covenants We were in compliance with the covenants in our financing agreements at December 31, 2016.; 0
0001.00172; The table does not include amounts that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time, including legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions and amounts payable under collective bargaining arrangements, among others. In addition, the table does not include expected significant cash payments representing obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business that do not include contractual commitments.The amounts presented are based on various estimates, including estimates regarding the timing of payments, prevailing interest rates, volumes purchased, the occurrence of certain events and other factors.; 0
0001.00173; Accordingly, the actual results may vary materially from the amounts presented in the table. Contractual Obligations by Year(1)(in millions)20172018201920202021ThereafterTotalLong-term debt (see Note 6); 0
0001.00174; Represents scheduled principal payments on long-term debt. Long-Term Debt, Interest Payments.; 0
0001.00175; Represents estimated interest payments under our long-term debt based on the interest rates specified in the applicable debt agreements.; 0
0001.00176; Interest payments on variable interest rate debt were calculated using London interbank offered rates (LIBOR) at December 31, 2016.; 0
0001.00177; Operating Lease Payments. Represents our minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases (including certain aircraft flown by regional carriers).; 0

0001.00179; Represents our estimated minimum fixed obligations under capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers.; 0
0001.00180; The reported amounts are based on (1) the required minimum levels of flying by our contract carriers under the applicable agreements and (2) assumptions regarding the costs associated with such minimum levels of flying.; 0
0001.00181; Employee Benefit Obligations.; 0
0001.00182; Represents primarily (1) our estimated minimum required funding for our qualified defined benefit pension plans based on actuarially determined estimates and (2) projected future benefit payments from our unfunded postretirement and postemployment plans.; 0

0001.00184; Other Obligations.; 0
0001.00185; Represents estimated purchase obligations under which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services, including, but not limited to, insurance, marketing, maintenance, technology, sponsorships and other third-party services and products.; 0
0001.00186; Accordingly, the actual results may differ materially from these estimates.; 0
0001.00187; For a discussion of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Frequent Flyer ProgramOur SkyMiles program offers incentives to travel on Delta.; 0
0001.00188; This program allows customers to earn mileage credits by flying on Delta, Delta Connection and airlines that participate in the SkyMiles program, as well as through participating companies such as credit card companies, hotels and car rental agencies. We sell mileage credits to non-airline businesses, customers and other airlines.; 0
0001.00189; Effective January 1, 2015, the SkyMiles program was modified from a model in which customers earn redeemable mileage credits based on distance traveled to a model based on ticket price.; 0
0001.00190; This award change did not affect the way we account for the program.; 0
0001.00191; The SkyMiles program includes two types of transactions that are considered revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables.; 0
0001.00192; As discussed below, these are (1) passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits and (2) the sale of mileage credits to participating companies with which we have marketing agreements.; 0
0001.00193; Mileage credits are a separate unit of accounting as they can be redeemed by customers in future periods for air travel on Delta and participating airlines, membership in our Sky Club and other program awards.Passenger Ticket Sales Earning Mileage Credits.; 0
0001.00194; Passenger ticket sales earning mileage credits under our SkyMiles program provide customers with (1) mileage credits earned and (2) air transportation.; 0
0001.00195; We value each deliverable on a standalone basis. Our estimate of the selling price of a mileage credit is based on an analysis of our sales of mileage credits to other airlines and customers, which is re-evaluated at least annually. We use established ticket prices to determine the estimated selling price of air transportation.; 0
0001.00196; We allocate the total amount collected from passenger ticket sales between the deliverables based on their relative selling prices.We defer revenue for the mileage credits related to passenger ticket sales when the credits are earned and recognize it as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided.; 0
0001.00197; We record the air transportation portion of the passenger ticket sales in air traffic liability and recognize these amounts in passenger revenue when we provide transportation or when the ticket expires unused.; 0
0001.00198; A hypothetical 10% increase in our estimate of the standalone selling price of a mileage credit would decrease passenger revenue by approximately $50 million, as a result of an increase in the amount of revenue deferred from the mileage component of passenger ticket sales.Sale of Mileage Credits.; 0
0001.00199; Customers may earn mileage credits through participating companies such as credit card companies, hotels and car rental agencies with which we have marketing agreements to sell mileage credits.; 0
0001.00200; Our contracts to sell mileage credits under these marketing agreements have multiple deliverables, as defined below.Our most significant contract to sell mileage credits relates to our co-brand credit card relationship with American Express.; 0
0001.00201; In December 2014, we amended our marketing agreements with American Express, which increased the value we receive under the agreements and extended the term to 2022.; 0
0001.00202; The amended agreements became effective January 1, 2015.; 0
0001.00203; We account for the agreements consistent with the accounting method that allocates the consideration received to the individual products and services delivered based on their relative selling prices.; 0
0001.00204; We determined our best estimate of the selling prices by considering discounted cash flow analysis using multiple inputs and assumptions, including: (1) the expected number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed, (2) the rate at which we sell mileage credits to other airlines, (3) published rates on our website for baggage fees, discounted access to Delta Sky Club lounges and other benefits while traveling on Delta and (4) brand value.; 0
0001.00205; The increased value received under the amended agreements increases the amount of deferred revenue for the travel component and increases the value of the other deliverables, which are recognized in other revenue as they are provided.We recognize revenue as we deliver each sales element.; 0
0001.00206; We defer the travel deliverable (mileage credits) as part of frequent flyer deferred revenue and recognize passenger revenue as the mileage credits are used for travel.; 0
0001.00207; The revenue allocated to the remaining deliverables is recorded in other revenue.; 0
0001.00208; We recognize the revenue for these services as they are performed. For mileage credits that we estimate are not likely to be redeemed (breakage), we recognize the associated value proportionally during the period in which the remaining mileage credits are expected to be redeemed.; 0
0001.00209; We use statistical models to estimate breakage based on historical redemption patterns. A change in assumptions as to the period over which mileage credits are expected to be redeemed, the actual redemption activity for mileage credits or the estimated fair value of mileage credits expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years.; 0
0001.00210; At December 31, 2016, the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the SkyMiles program was $3.9 billion.; 0
0001.00211; A hypothetical 1% change in the number of outstanding miles estimated to be redeemed would result in a $31 million impact on our deferred revenue liability at December 31, 2016.Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We apply a fair value-based impairment test to the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis (as of October 1) and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis.; 0
0001.00212; We assess the value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived assets under either a qualitative or quantitative approach.; 0
0001.00213; Under a qualitative approach, we consider various market factors, including the key assumptions listed below.; 0
0001.00214; We analyze these factors to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.; 0
0001.00215; If we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset may be impaired, we use the quantitative approach to assess the asset's fair value and the amount of the impairment. Under a quantitative approach, we calculate the fair value of the asset using the key assumptions listed below.When we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a quantitative approach, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit by considering both market capitalization and projected discounted future cash flows (an income approach).; 0
0001.00216; When we perform a quantitative impairment assessment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, fair value is estimated based on (1) recent market transactions, where available, (2) the royalty method for the Delta tradename (which assumes hypothetical royalties generated from using our tradename) or (3) projected discounted future cash flows (an income approach).; 0
0001.00217; Key Assumptions.; 0
0001.00218; The key assumptions in our impairment tests include: (1) forecasted revenues, expenses and cash flows, (2) terminal period revenue growth and cash flows, (3) an estimated weighted average cost of capital, (4) assumed discount rates depending on the asset and (5) a tax rate.; 0
0001.00219; These assumptions are consistent with those hypothetical market participants would use. Since we are required to make estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, actual transaction amounts may differ materially from these estimates.; 0
0001.00220; In addition, we consider the amount by which the intangible assets' fair values exceeded their respective carrying values in the most recent fair value measurements calculated using a quantitative approach.Changes in certain events and circumstances could result in impairment or a change from indefinite-lived to definite-lived.; 0
0001.00221; Factors which could cause impairment include, but are not limited to, (1) negative trends in our market capitalization, (2) reduced profitability resulting from lower passenger mile yields or higher input costs (primarily related to fuel and employees), (3) lower passenger demand as a result of weakened U.S. and global economies, (4) interruption to our operations due to a prolonged employee strike, terrorist attack, or other reasons, (5) changes to the regulatory environment (e.g., diminished slot restrictions or additional Open Skies agreements), (6) competitive changes by other airlines and (7) strategic changes to our operations leading to diminished utilization of the intangible assets.; 0
0001.00222; We assessed each of the above assumptions in our most recent impairment analyses.; 0
0001.00223; The combination of our most recently completed annual results and our projected revenues, expenses and cash flows more than offset any negative events and circumstances.; 0
0001.00224; The stabilized operating environment for U.S. airlines has led to improved financial results.Goodwill.; 0
0001.00225; Our goodwill balance, which is related to the airline segment, was $9.8 billion at December 31, 2016.; 0
0001.00226; Based upon our qualitative assessment of all relevant factors, including applicable factors noted in Key Assumptions above, we determined that there was no indication that goodwill was impaired.; 0
0001.00227; Identifiable Intangible Assets. Our identifiable intangible assets, which are related to the airline segment, had a net carrying amount of $4.8 billion at December 31, 2016, of which $4.7 billion related to indefinite-lived intangible assets.; 0
0001.00228; Indefinite-lived assets are not amortized and consist primarily of routes, slots, the Delta tradename and assets related to SkyTeam and collaborative arrangements.; 0
0001.00229; Definite-lived assets consist primarily of marketing and maintenance service agreements.; 0
0001.00230; In 2016, we performed qualitative assessments of our indefinite-lived intangible assets other than the Pacific routes and slots asset, including applicable factors noted in Key Assumptions above, and determined that there was no indication that the assets were impaired.; 0
0001.00231; Our qualitative assessments include analyses and weighting of all relevant factors, which impact the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. This intangible asset is composed of Pacific route authorities and takeoff and landing rights (slots) at capacity-constrained airports in Asia, including Tokyo-Narita airport.; 0
0001.00232; Changes in key inputs and assumptions, including (1) new or enhanced joint ventures or alliances, (2) legislative or regulatory changes, including access to Tokyo's Haneda airport, (3) foreign currency exchange rates, (4) fuel costs and (5) Pacific region profitability, could impact the value of this asset in the future.; 0
0001.00233; We performed a quantitative assessment of our Pacific routes and slots indefinite-lived intangible asset and determined that there was no indication that the asset was impaired as the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value.Long-Lived AssetsOur flight equipment and other long-lived assets have a recorded value of $24.4 billion at December 31, 2016.; 0
0001.00234; This value is based on various factors, including the assets' estimated useful lives and salvage values.; 0
0001.00235; We review flight equipment and other long-lived assets used in operations for impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired.; 0
0001.00236; Factors which could be indicators of impairment include, but are not limited to, (1) a decision to permanently remove flight equipment or other long-lived assets from operations, (2) significant changes in the estimated useful life, (3) significant changes in projected cash flows, (4) permanent and significant declines in fleet fair values and (5) changes to the regulatory environment.; 0
0001.00237; For long-lived assets held for sale, we discontinue depreciation and record impairment losses when the carrying amount of these assets is greater than the fair value less the cost to sell.To determine whether impairments exist for aircraft used in operations, we group assets at the fleet-type level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity, passenger mile yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors.; 0
0001.00238; If an impairment occurs, the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the fleet's carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. We estimate aircraft fair values using published sources, appraisals and bids received from third parties, as available.Defined Benefit Pension PlansWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees.; 0
0001.00239; These plans are closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals.; 0
0001.00240; As of December 31, 2016, the unfunded benefit obligation for these plans recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet was $10.6 billion. During 2016, we contributed $1.3 billion to these plans and recorded $251 million of expense in salaries and related costs on our Consolidated Statement of Operations.; 0
0001.00241; In 2017, we estimate we will contribute at least $1.2 billion to these plans, including $700 million of contributions above the minimum funding requirements.; 0
0001.00242; The most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and life expectancy.; 0
0001.00243; Weighted Average Discount Rate. We determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high-quality fixed income investments and yield-to-maturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments. We used a weighted average discount rate to value the obligations of 4.20% and 4.57% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.; 0
0001.00244; Our weighted average discount rate for net periodic pension benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date, ranging from 4.99% to 4.13% between 2014 and 2016.Expected Long-Term Rate of Return. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based primarily on plan-specific investment studies using historical market return and volatility data.; 0
0001.00245; Modest excess return expectations versus some public market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically. We also expect to receive a premium for investing in less liquid private markets.; 0
0001.00246; We review our rate of return on plan assets assumptions annually. Our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation.; 0
0001.00247; The investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plan assets is to earn a long-term return that meets or exceeds our annualized return target while taking an acceptable level of risk and maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay current benefits and other cash obligations of the plan. This is achieved by investing in a globally diversified mix of public and private equity, fixed income, real assets, hedge funds and other assets and instruments.; 0
0001.00248; Our expected long-term rate of return on assets for net periodic pension benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 8.94%.; 0
0001.00249; Changes in life expectancy may significantly change our benefit obligations and future expense.; 0
0001.00250; We use the Society of Actuaries' (SOA) published mortality data, other publicly available information and our own perspective of future longevity to develop our best estimate of life expectancy.; 0
0001.00251; In 2014, the SOA published updated mortality tables for U.S. plans and an updated improvement scale, which both reflected significant improvements in longevity.; 0
0001.00252; Since then, the SOA has published annual updates to their improvement scale.; 0
0001.00253; Each year we consider updates by the SOA in setting our mortality assumptions for purposes of measuring pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations.; 0
0001.00254; Funding. Our funding obligations for qualified defined benefit plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.; 0
0001.00255; The Pension Protection Act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding rules (Alternative Funding Rules) for defined benefit plans that are frozen.; 0
0001.00256; We elected the Alternative Funding Rules under which the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be amortized over a fixed 17-year period and is calculated using an 8.85% discount rate.While the Pension Protection Act makes our funding obligations for these plans more predictable, factors outside our control continue to have an impact on the funding requirements.; 0
0001.00257; Estimates of future funding requirements are based on various assumptions and can vary materially from actual funding requirements.; 0
0001.00258; Assumptions include, among other things, the actual and projected market performance of assets, statutory requirements and demographic data for participants.; 0
0001.00259; For additional information, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Recent Accounting StandardsRevenue from Contracts with Customers In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).; 0
0001.00260; Under this ASU and subsequently issued amendments, revenue is recognized at the time a good or service is transferred to a customer for the amount of consideration received. Entities may use a full retrospective approach or report the cumulative effect as of the date of adoption. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.; 0
0001.00261; Early adoption of the standard is permitted, but not before December 15, 2016.; 0
0001.00262; We are currently evaluating how the adoption of the revenue recognition standard will impact our Consolidated Financial Statements.; 0
0001.00263; Interpretations are on-going and could have a significant impact on our implementation.; 0
0001.00264; While we currently believe the adoption will have little effect on earnings, the classification of certain transactions within revenues and between revenues and operating expenses may change.; 0
0001.00265; Also, the adoption may increase the rate used to account for frequent flyer miles, which would impact the balance of the frequent flyer liability. We plan to adopt the standard effective January 1, 2018.Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.; 0
0001.00266; 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).; 0
0001.00267; This standard will require all leases with durations greater than twelve months to be recognized on the balance sheet and is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, although early adoption is permitted.; 0
0001.00268; We have not completed our assessment, but we believe adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.; 0
0001.00269; However, we do not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on the recognition, measurement or presentation of lease expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Operations or the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.; 0
0001.00270; Information about our undiscounted future lease payments and the timing of those payments is in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.; 0
0001.00271; 45Table of ContentsFinancial Instruments In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.; 0
0001.00272; 2016-01, Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10). This standard makes several changes, including the elimination of the available-for-sale classification of equity investments, and requires equity investments with readily determinable fair values to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.; 0
0001.00273; It is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.Our investments in the parent companies of Aeroméxico and GOL are currently accounted for as available-for-sale with changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income. At the time of adoption, any amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (AOCI) related to equity investments would be reclassified to retained earnings. As of December 31, 2016, a net unrealized loss of $38 million related to these investments was recorded in AOCI on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.; 1
0001.00274; Equity Method InvestmentsIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.; 0
0001.00275; 2016-07, Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323). This standard eliminates the requirement that when an existing cost method investment qualifies for use of the equity method, an investor must restate its historical financial statements, as if the equity method had been used since the investment was acquired.; 0
0001.00276; Under the new guidance, at the point an investment qualifies for the equity method, any unrealized gain or loss in AOCI will be recognized in non-operating income/expense.; 0
0001.00277; We adopted this standard during the March 2016 quarter.; 0
0001.00278; Although none of our available-for-sale or cost investments qualified for use of the equity method during 2016, we expect the tender offer for additional capital stock of Grupo Aeroméxico to be completed in the March 2017 quarter, at which point our investment will qualify for the equity method of accounting.; 0
0001.00279; Statement of Cash FlowsIn the second half of 2016, the FASB issued ASU Nos.; 0
0001.00280; 2016-15 and 2016-18 related to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments and the presentation of restricted cash within an entity's statement of cash flows, respectively.; 0
0001.00281; These standards are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, but early adoption is permitted.; 0
0001.00282; We do not expect these standards to have a material impact on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules, non-GAAP financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results.The following table shows a reconciliation of pre-tax income (a GAAP measure) to pre-tax income, adjusted for special items (a non-GAAP financial measure).; 0
0001.00283; We adjust pre-tax income for the following items to determine pre-tax income, adjusted for special items, for the reasons described below:•MTM adjustments and settlements.; 0
0001.00284; MTM adjustments are defined as fair value changes recorded in periods other than the settlement period.; 0
0001.00285; Such fair value changes are not necessarily indicative of the actual settlement value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period.; 0
0001.00286; Settlements represent cash received or paid on hedge contracts settled during the period.; 0
0001.00287; These items adjust fuel expense to show the economic impact of hedging, including cash received or paid on hedge contracts during the period.; 0
0001.00288; Adjusting for these items allows investors to better understand and analyze our core operational performance in the periods shown.•Restructuring and other.; 0
0001.00289; Because of the variability in restructuring and other, the adjustment for this item is helpful to investors to analyze our recurring core performance in the periods shown.•Virgin Atlantic MTM adjustments. We record our proportionate share of earnings from our equity investment in Virgin Atlantic in non-operating expense.; 0
0001.00290; We adjust for Virgin Atlantic's MTM adjustments to allow investors to better understand and analyze our core financial performance in the periods shown.; 0
0001.00291; We adjust CASM for the following items to determine CASM-Ex, including profit sharing for the reasons described below:• Aircraft fuel and related taxes.; 0
0001.00292; The volatility in fuel prices impacts the comparability of year-over-year financial performance.; 0
0001.00293; The adjustment for aircraft fuel and related taxes (including our regional carriers) allows investors to better understand and analyze our non-fuel costs and year-over-year financial performance.•Restructuring and other.; 0
0001.00294; Because of the variability in restructuring and other, the adjustment for this item is helpful to investors to analyze our recurring core performance in the periods shown.•Other expenses.; 0
0001.00295; Other expenses include aircraft maintenance and staffing services we provide to third parties, our vacation wholesale operations and refinery cost of sales to third parties.; 0
0001.00296; Because these businesses are not related to the generation of a seat mile, we adjust for the costs related to these sales to provide a more meaningful comparison of the costs of our airline operations to the rest of the airline industry.; 0
0001.00297; We present ROIC as management believes this metric is helpful to investors in assessing our ability to generate returns using its invested capital.; 0
0001.00298; ROIC is operating income, adjusted, divided by adjusted average invested capital.; 0
0001.00299; We adjust operating income for MTM adjustments and settlements and restructuring and other for the same reasons discussed above for pre-tax income.; 0
0001.00300; All adjustments to calculate ROIC are intended to provide a more meaningful comparison of our results to the airline industry and other high-quality industrial companies. Average adjusted net debt is calculated using amounts as of the end of the last five quarters.The following table shows a reconciliation of adjusted net debt. We use adjusted total debt, including aircraft rent and long-term adjusted debt and capital leases, to present estimated financial obligations.; 0
0001.00301; We reduce adjusted total debt by cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and hedge margin (receivable) payable, resulting in adjusted net debt, to present the amount of assets needed to satisfy the debt. We believe this metric is helpful to investors in assessing the company’s overall debt profile. We reduce adjusted total debt by the amount of hedge margin (receivable) payable, which reflects cash (posted to) received from counterparties, as we believe this removes the impact of current market volatility on our unsettled hedges and is a better representation of the continued progress we have made on our debt initiatives.; 0

0001.00307; RPM - Revenue Passenger Mile. One revenue-paying passenger transported one mile.; 0
0001.00308; RPMs equal the number of revenue passengers during a reporting period multiplied by the number of miles flown by those passengers during that period.; 0
0001.00309; RPMs are also referred to as traffic.; 0
0001.00310; QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe have market risk exposure related to aircraft fuel prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Market risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on our Consolidated Financial Statements.; 0
0001.00311; In an effort to manage our exposure to these risks, we enter into derivative contracts and may adjust our derivative portfolio as market conditions change.; 0
0001.00312; We expect adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments to result in ongoing volatility in earnings and stockholders' equity.The following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects of a change in demand for air travel, the economy as a whole or actions we may take to seek to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk.; 0
0001.00313; For these and other reasons, the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical results.Aircraft Fuel Price RiskChanges in aircraft fuel prices materially impact our results of operations. We have recently managed our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact from changes in the price of jet fuel as jet fuel prices are subject to potential volatility.; 0
0001.00314; During the March 2016 quarter, to better participate in the low fuel price environment, we entered into derivatives designed to offset and effectively neutralize our existing airline segment hedge positions. As a result, we locked in the amount of net hedge settlements for the remainder of 2016 and 2017.; 1
0001.00315; During the June 2016 quarter, we early settled $455 million of our airline segment's 2016 positions.; 0
0001.00316; We recognized $366 million of fuel hedge losses during the year ended December 31, 2016.For the year ended December 31, 2016, aircraft fuel and related taxes, including our regional carriers, accounted for $6.0 billion, or 18.3%, of our total operating expense, based on annual consumption of approximately four billion gallons of jet fuel.; 0
0001.00317; Assuming we do not enter into new derivative contracts, we are exposed to changes in the market price of jet fuel. A one cent increase in the cost of jet fuel would result in approximately $40 million of additional annual fuel expense.Interest Rate RiskOur exposure to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates is primarily associated with our long-term debt obligations.; 0
0001.00318; Market risk associated with our fixed and variable rate long-term debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future earnings, respectively, from an increase in interest rates.; 0
0001.00319; At December 31, 2016, we had $3.4 billion of fixed-rate long-term debt and $3.7 billion of variable-rate long-term debt.; 0
0001.00320; An increase of 100 basis points in average annual interest rates would have decreased the estimated fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt by $120 million at December 31, 2016 and would have increased the annual interest expense on our variable-rate long-term debt by $37 million, exclusive of the impact of our interest rate hedge contract. We have one interest rate hedge contract with a notional value of $349 million.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk because we have revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies with our primary exposures being the Japanese yen and Canadian dollar.; 0
0001.00321; To manage exchange rate risk, we execute both our international revenue and expense transactions in the same foreign currency to the extent practicable.; 0
0001.00322; From time to time, we may also enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts.; 0
0001.00323; At December 31, 2016, we had open foreign currency forward contracts totaling a $27 million asset position.; 0
0001.00324; We estimate that a 10% depreciation or appreciation in the price of the Japanese yen and Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar would change the projected cash settlement value of our open hedge contracts by a $45 million gain or $55 million loss, respectively, for the year ending December 31, 2017.; 0

0002.00004; The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Impact of the COVID-19 PandemicThe unprecedented, widespread and persistent impact of COVID-19 and the related travel restrictions and social distancing measures implemented throughout the world have significantly reduced demand for air travel. After initially impacting our service to China beginning in January 2020, the spread of the virus and the resulting global pandemic have significantly affected our entire network.; 0
0002.00005; Beginning in March 2020, large public events were cancelled, governmental authorities began imposing restrictions on non-essential activities, businesses suspended travel and popular leisure destinations temporarily closed to visitors.; 0
0002.00006; Certain countries that are key markets for our business have imposed bans on international travelers for specified periods or indefinitely.As a result, demand for travel declined at a rapid pace in the March 2020 quarter and has remained depressed, which has had an unprecedented and materially adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.; 0
0002.00007; Although demand has improved at a slow pace since that time, it remains significantly below pre-pandemic levels.; 0
0002.00008; The exact timing and pace of the recovery remain uncertain as certain markets have reopened, some of which have since experienced a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, while others, particularly international markets, remain closed or are enforcing extended quarantines for most U.S. residents.; 0
0002.00009; The U.S. and numerous other countries are now also requiring airline passengers to provide negative COVID-19 test results prior to travel into their countries.; 0
0002.00010; Additionally, some states have instituted travel restrictions, advisories or quarantines for travelers from other states within the U.S. We expect the demand environment to remain depressed until effective vaccines become broadly available, vaccination becomes widespread globally and travel restrictions and advisories begin to ease. Our forecasted expense and liquidity management initiatives may be modified as the demand environment evolves.In response to these developments, we have implemented enhanced measures focusing on the safety of our customers and employees, while at the same time seeking to mitigate the impact on our financial position and operations and to position our business for recovery.Taking Care of our Customers and Employees.; 0
0002.00011; The safety of our customers and employees is our primary focus.; 0
0002.00012; As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, we have taken numerous steps to help promote the safety of our customers and employees on the ground and in the air in keeping with current health-expert recommendations, including:•Adopting new cleaning procedures on all flights, including regular disinfectant electrostatic spraying on aircraft and sanitizing high-touch areas like tray tables, entertainment screens, armrests and seat-back pockets.•Taking steps to help employees and customers practice social distancing and promote safety, including:◦Creating a Global Cleanliness Division to ensure a consistently safe and sanitized experience across our facilities and aircraft.◦Beginning in May 2020, requiring all customers and customer-facing employees to wear masks.◦Capping load factors throughout our aircraft and blocking middle seats through at least April 30, 2021.◦Modifying our boarding and deplaning processes, while providing limited food and beverage service that is designed to reduce physical touch points.; 0
0002.00013; ◦Encouraging social distancing throughout all aspects of our operation.◦Implementing significant workforce social distancing and protection measures, including reconfiguring call center spaces to promote social distancing, increasing cleaning and disinfecting of our facilities and encouraging employees to work remotely when possible.•Giving customers flexibility to plan and re-book travel, including extending expiration on certain tickets and travel credits through December 2022, eliminating change fees for domestic tickets and international tickets originating from North America, with the exception of Basic Economy tickets, and waiving change fees for all tickets purchased before March 30, 2021.; 0
0002.00014; Additionally, we are extending 2020 Medallion Status an additional year, rolling Medallion Qualification Miles into 2021 and extending Delta SkyMiles American Express Card benefits and Delta Sky Club memberships.Delta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K ; 0

0002.00021; We have also added rapid testing in most U.S. hubs for active flight crews.Capacity Reductions.; 0
0002.00022; Beginning in the second half of March 2020, we experienced a precipitous decrease in demand as COVID-19 spread throughout the world.; 0
0002.00023; While we have increased capacity compared to the lowest levels in April 2020, system capacity remains significantly lower than prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.; 0
0002.00024; During 2020, system capacity was reduced approximately 50% compared to 2019, with international capacity reduced by approximately 65% and domestic capacity reduced by approximately 45%.; 0
0002.00025; System capacity for the March 2020 through December 2020 period, excluding the pre-pandemic months of January and February, was reduced by approximately 60%, with international capacity reduced by approximately 75% and domestic capacity reduced by approximately 50%.; 0
0002.00026; For the March 2021 quarter, system capacity is expected to be down approximately 30%-40% compared to the March 2019 quarter.; 0
0002.00027; As a result of reduced demand and lower capacity, we retired 227 aircraft in 2020 and have temporarily parked approximately 125 aircraft as of December 31, 2020.Expense Management.; 1
0002.00028; In response to the reduction in revenue, we have implemented, and will continue to implement, cost saving initiatives, including the following in 2020:•Reducing capacity as described above to align with expected demand, which has resulted in removing from active service approximately 350 aircraft as of December 31, 2020, including certain fleets or aircraft that we have decided to early retire as described below.; 1
0002.00029; •Consolidating our footprint at our airport facilities, including temporarily closing some Delta Sky Clubs.•Avoiding furloughs for our U.S. employees and reducing employee-related costs, through the following: ◦Voluntary unpaid leaves of 30 days to 12 months offered to most employees.; 0
0002.00030; Approximately 50,000 of our employees have taken or have elected to take voluntary leaves at various times during 2020 and, for those taking leaves up to 12 months, continuing through 2021.◦Offering employees early retirement and voluntary separation programs, with approximately 18,000 employees electing to participate.; 0
0002.00031; See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.◦Reaching an agreement with ALPA that protects our pilots from furlough through April 2022.◦From April 1 through December 31, 2020, salary reductions of 100% for our CEO, 50% for our officers and a 25% reduction in work hours for all other management and most front-line employee work groups.•Delaying or eliminating nearly all other discretionary spending.Balance Sheet, Cash Flow and Liquidity.; 0
0002.00032; Our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and aggregate principal amount committed and available to be drawn under our revolving credit facilities (liquidity) as of December 31, 2020 was $16.7 billion as a result of the following actions to increase liquidity and strengthen our financial position during the year ended December 31, 2020:•Completing financing transactions for an aggregate principal amount of approximately $25.9 billion.; 1
0002.00033; •Receiving $5.6 billion as part of the CARES Act payroll support program as described in Government Support Programs below.; 0

0002.00044; The CARES Act is a support package intended to assist many aspects of the American economy, including providing the airline industry with up to $25 billion in grants and loans to be used for employee wages, salaries and benefits.; 0
0002.00045; In April 2020, we entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury to receive emergency support through the CARES Act payroll support program, which totaled $5.6 billion. The support payments were conditioned on our agreement to comply with a variety of conditions, including to refrain from conducting involuntary employee layoffs or furloughs through September 30, 2020.; 0
0002.00046; The support payments consisted of $4.0 billion in a grant and $1.6 billion in an unsecured 10-year low interest loan.; 0
0002.00047; The loan bears interest at an annual rate of 1.00% for the first five years (through April 2025) and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 2.00% in the final five years. In return, we issued to the U.S. Department of the Treasury warrants to acquire more than 6.7 million shares of Delta common stock, which represented approximately 1% of our outstanding shares.; 0
0002.00048; These warrants have an initial exercise price of $24.39 per share, subject to adjustment in certain cases, and a five-year term.The relative fair value of the warrants issued in 2020 is recorded within stockholder's equity and as a discount reducing the carrying value of the loan which is being amortized as interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations (income statement) over the term of the loan. The proceeds of the 2020 CARES Act grant were recorded in cash and cash equivalents when received and were recognized as contra-expense in government grant recognition in our income statement over the periods that the funds were intended to compensate.; 0
0002.00049; See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the unsecured loan and warrants to acquire Delta shares issued under the CARES Act payroll support program.Finally, the CARES Act also provides for deferred payment of the employer portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020, with 50% of the deferred amount due December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% due December 31, 2022. This provided us with approximately $200 million of additional liquidity during 2020.On December 27, 2020, an additional COVID-19 support bill was enacted into law, which extends the payroll support program of the CARES Act and provides an additional $15 billion in grants and loans to be used for airline employee wages, salaries and benefits.; 1
0002.00050; In January 2021, we entered into a payroll support program extension agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury. We expect to receive $2.9 billion in payroll support payments, which must be used exclusively for the payment of employee wages, salaries and benefits and are conditioned on our agreement to refrain from conducting involuntary employee layoffs or furloughs from the date of the extension agreement through March 2021.; 1
0002.00051; Other conditions include prohibitions on share repurchases and dividends through March 2022 and certain limitations on executive compensation until October 2022.; 0
0002.00052; The Department of Transportation also has the authority until March 1, 2022 to require airlines that received payroll support program funds to maintain scheduled air service deemed necessary to any point served by the airline before March 1, 2020.The expected support payments consist of approximately $2.0 billion in grants and $830 million in an unsecured 10-year low interest loan.; 0
0002.00053; We received the first installment of $1.4 billion under the agreement on January 15, 2021 and expect to receive the balance in the March 2021 quarter.; 0
0002.00054; The loan bears interest at an annual rate of 1.00% for the first five years (through January 15, 2026) and the applicable SOFR plus 2.00% in the final five years. Approximately 70% of the payment received on January 15, 2021 was in the form of a grant, and approximately 30% was in the form of an unsecured loan.; 0
0002.00055; We issued a promissory note for approximately $400 million with respect to the term loan, which will increase to its full principal amount as the balance of payroll support payments is received.; 0
0002.00056; In connection with receipt of these payments, we also expect to issue to the U.S. Department of the Treasury warrants to acquire shares of Delta common stock, which we expect to be approximately 2.1 million shares representing less than 0.5% of our outstanding shares.; 1
0002.00057; Approximately one-half of the expected warrants were issued on January 15, 2021 and the remaining warrants will be issued as the balance of payroll support payments is received. These warrants have an initial exercise price of $39.73 per share, subject to adjustment in certain cases, and a five-year term.Delta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K ; 0

0002.00064; MD&A - Financial HighlightsFinancial Highlights - 2020 Compared to 2019Our pre-tax loss for 2020 was $15.6 billion, representing a $21.8 billion decrease compared to the prior year primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business which resulted in a 64% decrease in revenue and $8.2 billion of restructuring charges and $2.4 billion in investment impairments and equity method losses.; 1
0002.00065; Pre-tax loss, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure) was $9.0 billion, a decrease of $15.2 billion compared to the prior year.; 0
0002.00066; Adjustments for 2020 were primarily related to restructuring charges from fleet retirement decisions, voluntary early retirement and separation programs charges and investment impairments and equity method losses, which were partially offset by recognition of the CARES Act grant.Revenue.; 0
0002.00067; Compared to 2020, our operating revenue decreased $29.9 billion, or 64% due to reduced demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.; 1
0002.00068; Operating Expense.; 0
0002.00069; Total operating expense decreased $10.8 billion, or 27%, compared to the prior year, primarily resulting from lower volume and selling-related expenses including fuel, lower profit sharing, recognition of the CARES Act payroll support program grant and significant cost reduction measures taken across all aspects of our operation in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by restructuring charges.; 1
0002.00070; Total operating expense, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure) decreased $16.0 billion, or 40% compared to the prior year.; 0
0002.00071; Our total operating cost per available seat mile (CASM) increased 50% to 22.01 cents compared to the prior year, primarily due to the 51% decrease in capacity, which was partially offset by the significant cost reduction measures discussed above.; 1
0002.00072; Non-fuel unit costs (CASM-Ex, a non-GAAP financial measure) increased 43% to 15.61 cents and consolidated CASM, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure, which includes aircraft fuel costs) increased 23% to 17.96 cents.Non-Operating Results.; 0
0002.00073; Total non-operating expense was $3.1 billion in 2020, $2.7 billion higher than the prior year primarily resulting from impairments and our proportionate share of equity method losses related to our investments in LATAM, Grupo Aeroméxico and Virgin Atlantic, and higher interest expense as a result of our increased debt balances due to the financing arrangements entered into during 2020.Cash Flow.; 1
0002.00074; Our liquidity at December 31, 2020 was $16.7 billion, a $10.8 billion increase compared to December 31, 2019 as a result of proceeds from loans and debt issuances (including our SkyMiles financing arrangements and aircraft financings), support payments under the CARES Act payroll support program and other liquidity initiatives.; 1
0002.00075; Losses during 2020 resulted in operating activities using $3.8 billion.; 1
0002.00076; During 2020 we incurred $9.2 billion of investing cash outflows, primarily related to the purchase of short-term investments and our tender offer to acquire shares of LATAM in January 2020. These results generated $4.3 billion of negative free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) in 2020 compared to $4.2 billion of free cash flow in 2019.The non-GAAP financial measures pre-tax loss, adjusted, operating expense, adjusted, CASM-Ex, consolidated CASM, adjusted, and free cash flow used above are defined and reconciled in Supplemental Information below.; 1

0002.00085; The decrease in operating revenue, on a 51% decrease in capacity, generated a 25% decrease in total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) and a 30% decrease in TRASM, adjusted compared to 2019.; 1
0002.00086; The increase in third-party refinery sales resulted from the refinery's shift to producing more non-jet fuel products due to the decline in demand for jet fuel.; 1
0002.00087; See Refinery Segment below for additional details on the refinery's operations during 2020.We have historically generated cargo revenues in domestic and international markets through the use of cargo space on regularly scheduled passenger aircraft.; 0
0002.00088; In 2020, following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced industry capacity drove a significant increase in our cargo yield, and we also generated cargo revenue through the operation of cargo-only charter flights (i.e., using aircraft in our fleet not then being utilized for passenger travel). These two factors contributed to the smaller percentage decline in cargo revenue, than in passenger revenue, compared to the prior year.The length and severity of the reduction in travel demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic are uncertain, as described in Item 1A.; 1
0002.00089; Risk Factors, but we currently expect three phases in 2021.; 0
0002.00090; We anticipate that the early part of the year will be characterized by fluctuating demand.; 0
0002.00091; With continued distribution of effective vaccines and easing of travel advisories and restrictions, we believe customer confidence will grow, leading to increased demand in the spring and summer of 2021.; 0
0002.00092; We expect vaccination to become widespread during the second half of 2021, resulting in sustained demand improvement.Delta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K ; 0

0002.00098; Load factor decreased 32 pts from the prior year to 55%.We began waiving changes fees on most tickets during 2020 and subsequently changed our policy with respect to change fees, as described above in Taking Care of our Customers and Employees.; 0
0002.00099; We do not expect these policy changes to materially affect our revenue in future periods.; 0
0002.00100; DomesticPrior to the initial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, domestic results were strong with revenue nearly 10% higher than the prior year period.; 0
0002.00101; However, due to the decrease in customer demand beginning in March, passenger unit revenue related to our domestic region decreased 42% with capacity down 43% compared to the prior year.; 1
0002.00102; We are planning for improvement to the demand environment, primarily from leisure customers, to continue in 2021, though still significantly lower than the comparable period in 2019.; 0
0002.00103; We remain optimistic about the ultimate recovery of business travel, but are unable to predict the timing or extent of that recovery.; 0
0002.00104; InternationalPassenger revenue related to our international regions decreased 76% compared to the prior year.; 0
0002.00105; The reductions in revenue and capacity presented in the table above were a result of reduced demand and government travel directives and quarantines limiting or suspending air travel due to the global spread of COVID-19.; 1
0002.00106; Additionally, many countries have implemented international testing requirements, which has slowed demand in the short-term but is expected to enhance the long-term recovery of international air travel.; 1
0002.00107; We expect this significantly lower demand environment to continue into 2021, with improvement expected after the recovery in domestic travel. As an initial step to this recovery, in December 2020 we became the first U.S. airline to offer flights between the U.S. and Europe that allow customers to avoid quarantine upon arrival after testing negative for the virus prior to travel and upon arrival in Amsterdam and Rome.; 0
0002.00108; During 2020 we transferred our U.S.-Tokyo services from Narita to Haneda airport, Tokyo's preferred airport for corporate customers, and continued to develop our network connectivity with our joint venture partner Korean Air at Seoul-Incheon airport.; 0
0002.00109; In each of the international regions we continue to monitor government travel directives and customer demand and will adjust flight schedules accordingly.; 0
0002.00110; Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we completed two transactions to further strengthen our international partnerships.; 0
0002.00111; In the Atlantic region, effective January 2020, we combined our separate transatlantic joint venture agreements with Air France-KLM and Virgin Atlantic into a single three-party transatlantic joint venture.; 0
0002.00112; This enhanced joint venture is designed to strengthen collaboration between the three airlines and is expected to provide customers with increased access to destinations across North America, the U.K. and Europe.; 0
0002.00113; In the Latin America region, in January 2020, we completed the tender offer to acquire 20% of the shares of LATAM as part of our plan to create a strategic alliance.; 0
0002.00114; Additionally, in the March 2020 quarter, we started codesharing for certain flights operated by LATAM.; 0
0002.00115; In May 2020, we signed a trans-American joint venture agreement with LATAM that, subject to regulatory approvals, will combine our highly complementary route networks between North and South America, with the goal of providing customers with a seamless travel experience and industry-leading connectivity.; 0
0002.00116; We believe this alliance will generate growth opportunities, building upon Delta's and LATAM's global footprint and joint ventures.; 0

0002.00125; Refinery sales to third parties, which are at or near cost, increased $1.1 billion compared to 2019. The increase in third-party refinery sales resulted from the refinery's shift to producing more non-jet fuel products due to the decline in demand for jet fuel.; 1
0002.00126; The increase in refinery sales was partially offset by an approximately $270 million, or approximately 30%, decline in revenue from aircraft maintenance services we provide to third parties, which decreased due to the reduction in flights operated worldwide.; 1
0002.00127; In addition, results for 2019 also included approximately $200 million of revenue from Delta Private Jets, which was combined with Wheels Up in January 2020 and is no longer reflected in ancillary businesses and refinery.; 0
0002.00128; Loyalty Program.; 0
0002.00129; Loyalty program revenues relate primarily to brand usage by third parties and other performance obligations embedded in miles sold, including redemption of miles for non-travel awards.; 0
0002.00130; These revenues are mainly driven by customer spend on American Express cards, which declined at a lower rate than air travel, during the year.Miscellaneous.; 0
0002.00131; Miscellaneous revenue is primarily composed of lounge access and codeshare revenues.; 0
0002.00132; The volume of these transactions has fallen compared to 2019, due to the impact of, and our response to, the COVID-19 pandemic.Delta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K ; 1

0002.00139; As a result, most operating expense line items decreased significantly in 2020 compared to 2019.; 0
0002.00140; Operating expenses decreased primarily due to the voluntary separation programs and work hour reductions described below, the many cost reduction measures and programs implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the reduction in volume and selling-related costs.; 1
0002.00141; During 2021, as effective vaccines become broadly available, vaccination becomes widespread globally, travel restrictions and advisories begin to ease and customer confidence begins to grow, we expect operating expense to increase as capacity and revenue return. However, we believe that many of the cost savings achieved during 2020 were structural in nature, which we expect to lead to lower non-fuel unit cost in the future.The discussion below is focused largely on the year-over-year changes in certain operating expense line items that were not primarily driven by the reduction in capacity or revenue.; 0
0002.00142; These include many of the cost reduction measures and programs we implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Salaries and Related Costs.; 1
0002.00143; The decrease in salaries and related costs is primarily due to actions taken in response to the decreased demand for air travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic.; 1
0002.00144; Beginning in March 2020 and continuing through December 2020, we reduced salaries by 100% for our CEO and 50% for our officers.; 0
0002.00145; In addition, we reduced work hours by 25% for all other management and most front-line employee work groups.; 0
0002.00146; We offered voluntary unpaid leaves of absence for periods ranging from 30 days up to 12 months and approximately 50,000 of our employees elected a leave at various times throughout 2020.; 0
0002.00147; Also, during the September 2020 quarter, approximately 18,000 employees elected to participate in voluntary separation programs, reducing our workforce by approximately 20%.; 0
0002.00148; We expect the lower headcount following these voluntary separation programs to mitigate the impact on salaries and related costs from the restoration of salaries and work hours in 2021, enabling us to maintain lower costs compared to 2019.Delta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K   ; 0

0002.00158; (5)Because we combined Delta Private Jets with Wheels Up in January 2020, we have excluded the impact of Delta Private Jets from 2019 results for comparability.Depreciation and Amortization.; 0
0002.00159; The decrease in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to aircraft that have been retired or impaired during 2020, including the MD-88, MD-90, 717, 737-700, 767-300ER and 777 fleet types, as well as certain A320 aircraft.; 1
0002.00160; Impairments and other charges related to the retirement of these fleets are reflected in restructuring charges.; 0
0002.00161; See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about these fleet retirements.Ancillary Businesses and Refinery.; 0
0002.00162; Ancillary businesses and refinery includes expenses associated with refinery sales to third parties, aircraft maintenance services we provide to third parties and our vacation wholesale operations.; 0
0002.00163; Increased expenses were primarily related to refinery sales to third parties, which are at or near cost.; 1
0002.00164; These refinery cost of sales increased $1.1 billion compared to 2019.; 0
0002.00165; Due to the decrease in demand for jet fuel following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the refinery shifted production to more non-jet fuel products, which increased the sales to third parties during 2020 compared to the prior year period.; 1
0002.00166; The increase in refinery costs was partially offset by a decrease of approximately $260 million in the cost of aircraft maintenance services we provide to third parties compared to 2019 due to the reduction in flights operated worldwide.; 1
0002.00167; In addition, approximately $180 million of costs related to services performed by Delta Private Jets in 2019 were recorded in ancillary businesses and refinery prior to the combination of that business with Wheels Up in January 2020.Aircraft Rent.; 0
0002.00168; Most aircraft operating lease expenses are recorded in aircraft rent and are contractually fixed. Therefore, aircraft rent did not decline to the same extent as our other operating expense line items compared to 2019.Restructuring Charges.; 1
0002.00169; Restructuring charges are composed of various expenses that resulted from our response to the unprecedented impact on our business from the COVID-19 pandemic primarily due to fleet impairment and related charges and voluntary separation program charges.; 1
0002.00170; See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about these restructuring charges.; 0
0002.00171; Government Grant Recognition.; 0

0002.00173; The support payments included a grant of $4.0 billion that was fully recognized as a contra-expense in 2020 over the period that the funds were intended to benefit.; 0
0002.00174; We expect to receive approximately $2.9 billion in the March 2021 quarter as part of the payroll support program extension, of which approximately $2.0 billion is expected to be in the form of grants that we plan to recognize as contra-expense during the first half of 2021.; 0

0002.00189; Foreign exchange gains/losses vary and impact the comparability of miscellaneous, net from period to period.; 0
0002.00190; The increase in 2020 compared to the prior year is primarily due to the $240 million gain recognized as a result of the combination of Delta Private Jets with Wheels Up in January 2020 and favorable movement in pension and related expense in 2020 compared to 2019.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate for 2020 was 21%. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $5.7 billion of U.S. federal pre-tax net operating loss carryforwards, of which $2.0 billion was generated prior to 2018 and will not begin to expire until 2027, and under current tax law, the remaining amount has no expiration.For more information about our income taxes, see Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.; 0

0002.00197; MD&A - Refinery SegmentRefinery SegmentThe refinery operated by our subsidiary Monroe Energy, LLC and MIPC, LLC (collectively, Monroe) primarily produces gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.; 0
0002.00198; Monroe has agreements in place to exchange the non-jet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations.; 0
0002.00199; Historically, the jet fuel produced and procured through exchanging gasoline and diesel fuel produced by the refinery provided approximately 200,000 barrels per day, or approximately 75% of our pre-COVID-19 pandemic consumption, for use in our airline operations.; 0
0002.00200; We believe that the jet fuel supply resulting from the refinery's operation generally contributes to reducing the market price of jet fuel and lowers our cost of jet fuel compared to what it otherwise would be.The refinery’s production has also been altered by the dramatic change in economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.; 1
0002.00201; During 2020, the refinery operated at 60% – 90% of normal production levels, largely due to the significant decrease in the demand for jet fuel. Additionally, due to the decrease in demand for jet fuel, the refinery has shifted production to produce more non-jet fuel products.; 1
0002.00202; Those non-jet fuel products will continue to be exchanged for jet fuel to the extent that the refinery can balance refinery sales with jet fuel demand.The refinery recorded operating revenues of $3.1 billion in 2020, compared to $5.6 billion in 2019.; 0
0002.00203; As a result of the refinery's shift to producing more non-jet fuel products, operating revenues in 2020 were composed of $1.5 billion of non-jet fuel products exchanged with third parties to procure jet fuel, $1.1 billion of refinery sales to third parties, $307 million of non-jet fuel product sales and $214 million of sales of jet fuel to the airline segment.; 1
0002.00204; Refinery revenues decreased compared to the prior year periods due to lower refinery run rates during the year, as well as lower pricing for refined products.The refinery recorded an operating loss of $216 million in 2020, compared to operating income of $76 million in 2019.; 1
0002.00205; The operating loss in 2020 compared to income in 2019 was mainly driven by an increase in RINs compliance costs discussed below and the reduction in revenue, which was partially offset by cost savings resulting from decreased production levels.A refinery is subject to annual EPA requirements to blend renewable fuels into the gasoline and on-road diesel fuel it produces. Alternatively, a refinery may purchase renewable energy credits, called RINs, from third parties in the secondary market.; 0
0002.00206; The refinery operated by Monroe purchases the majority of its RINs requirement in the secondary market.; 0

0002.00213; MD&A - Financial Condition and LiquidityFinancial Condition and LiquidityAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we took actions to increase liquidity and strengthen our financial position, which included the following during 2020. We are continuing to monitor and carefully manage our liquidity.; 0
0002.00214; •Completing financing transactions for an aggregate principal amount of approximately $25.9 billion, which are discussed in Financing Activities below.•Receiving $5.6 billion as part of the CARES Act payroll support program as described in Government Support Programs above.; 0
0002.00215; •Reducing planned capital expenditures by approximately $2.8 billion for the year to $1.9 billion, including restructuring our aircraft order books for future aircraft deliveries, delaying aircraft modifications and postponing certain information technology initiatives and ground equipment replacement. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our aircraft purchase commitments.•Amending our credit facilities to replace fixed charge coverage ratio covenants with liquidity-based covenants.•Suspending share repurchases and dividends indefinitely and postponing voluntary pension funding.As of December 31, 2020, we had $16.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and aggregate principal amount committed and available to be drawn under our revolving credit facilities.; 0
0002.00216; In addition, in January 2021 we received $1.4 billion with respect to the payroll support program extension described below, with the remaining $1.5 billion expected in the March 2021 quarter.; 0
0002.00217; We expect to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months with cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, financing arrangements, government assistance under the payroll support program, restricted cash equivalents and cash flows from operations.; 0
0002.00218; We expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs with cash flows from operations and financing arrangements.We have unencumbered assets available for potential financing arrangements, if needed.; 0
0002.00219; During 2020, we used existing cash and cash received from financings to fund capital expenditures of $1.9 billion, of which the largest portion was incurred before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to return $604 million to shareholders also before the onset of the global pandemic.; 0
0002.00220; Capital expenditures in 2020 following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic were limited to only those critical to our operation.The following discussion of liquidity evaluates various material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations, but does not include amounts that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time, including legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions and amounts payable under collective bargaining arrangements, among others.; 0

0002.00228; MD&A - Financial Condition and LiquidityOur operating cash flows are impacted by the following factors:Seasonality of Advance Ticket Sales.; 0
0002.00229; We sell tickets for air travel in advance of the customer's travel date.; 0
0002.00230; When we receive a cash payment at the time of sale, we record the cash received on advance sales as deferred revenue in air traffic liability.; 0
0002.00231; The air traffic liability has historically increased during the winter and spring as advanced ticket sales grow prior to the summer peak travel season and decreased during the summer and fall months.; 1
0002.00232; However, the ongoing reduction in demand for air travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented low level of advance bookings and the associated cash received, as well as significant ticket cancellations which led to issuance of cash refunds or travel credits to customers.; 1
0002.00233; The total value of cash refunds, excluding taxes and related fees, issued to customers during 2020 was approximately $3.1 billion.; 0
0002.00234; Travel credits represented approximately 65% of the air traffic liability as of December 31, 2020.; 0
0002.00235; The length and severity of the reduction in travel demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic are uncertain, as described in Item 1A. Risk Factors, but we currently expect three phases in 2021.; 0
0002.00236; We anticipate that the early part of the year will be characterized by fluctuating demand.; 0
0002.00237; With continued distribution of effective vaccines and easing of travel advisories and restrictions, we believe customer confidence will grow, leading to increased demand in the spring and summer of 2021. We expect vaccination to become widespread during the second half of 2021, resulting in sustained demand improvement.Fuel.; 0
0002.00238; Fuel expense represented approximately 11% of our total operating expense for 2020.; 0
0002.00239; The market price for jet fuel is volatile, which can impact the comparability of our periodic cash flows from operations.; 0
0002.00240; We expect fuel consumption to be lower through the March 2021 quarter than the comparable quarter in 2020, as only the final weeks of the March 2020 quarter were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.; 0
0002.00241; Through the remainder of 2021, as effective vaccines become broadly available, vaccination becomes widespread globally, travel restrictions and advisories begin to ease and customer confidence begins to grow, we expect capacity to return and fuel consumption to increase compared to the comparable period of 2020, though we still expect it to be lower than the comparable period in 2019.Employee Benefit Obligations. We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees.; 0
0002.00242; These plans are closed to new entrants and are frozen for future benefit accruals.; 0
0002.00243; Our funding obligations for these plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as modified by the Pension Protection Act of 2006.; 0
0002.00244; We had no minimum funding requirements in 2019 or 2020, we have no such requirements in 2021, and based on our current projections, we do not expect any minimum required contributions until 2025.; 0
0002.00245; However, during 2019, we voluntarily contributed $1 billion to these plans.; 0
0002.00246; As a part of our liquidity initiatives we suspended voluntary pension funding that we were previously planning in 2020.; 0
0002.00247; We plan to contribute at least $500 million to these plans in 2021.; 0
0002.00248; In addition, we have employee benefit obligations relating primarily to projected future benefit payments from our unfunded postretirement and postemployment plans.; 0
0002.00249; See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our employee benefit obligations.Voluntary Separation Programs. In 2020, we recorded a $3.4 billion charge associated with voluntary early retirement and separation programs and other employee benefit charges.; 0
0002.00250; Approximately $720 million of this charge was disbursed in cash payments to participants during 2020.; 0
0002.00251; An additional approximately $250 million of cash payments were disbursed in 2020 related to unused vacation and other benefits, which were accrued prior to the voluntary programs charge.; 0
0002.00252; We anticipate that approximately $600 million in cash payments will be made to participants in the voluntary separation programs in 2021 and the remaining payments in 2022 and beyond.Profit Sharing.; 0
0002.00253; Our broad-based employee profit sharing program provides that, for each year in which we have an annual pre-tax profit, as defined by the terms of the program, we will pay a specified portion of that profit to employees.; 0
0002.00254; We paid $1.6 billion in profit sharing in February 2020 related to our 2019 pre-tax profit in recognition of our employees' contributions toward meeting our financial goals.; 1
0002.00255; We will not have a profit sharing payment in 2021 based on the pre-tax loss in 2020.Government Support Programs.; 0

0002.00272; Using a portion of the proceeds we obtained through our financing transactions discussed below, in 2020 we acquired a net of $5.8 billion in short-term investments.; 0
0002.00273; See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these investments. Capital Expenditures.; 0
0002.00274; Our capital expenditures are primarily related to the purchase of aircraft, fleet modifications and technology enhancements.; 0
0002.00275; Our capital expenditures were $1.9 billion in 2020, of which the largest portion was incurred before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and $4.9 billion in 2019.; 0
0002.00276; In 2020, we restructured our aircraft order books with Airbus and MHI RJ Aviation Group (manufacturer of CRJ aircraft) in an effort to better match the timing of aircraft deliveries with our network and financial needs over the next several years.; 0
0002.00277; The restructuring reduced our aircraft purchase commitments by more than $2 billion in 2020 and by more than $5 billion through 2022.; 0
0002.00278; The shift in delivery timing is intended to allow us to continue simplifying and modernizing our fleet while maintaining our Airbus order book.We expect that we will have capital expenditures of approximately $2.5 billion in 2021 primarily for aircraft, including deliveries and advance deposit payments, as well as aircraft modifications, the majority of which relate to cabin improvements and technology enhancements.; 0
0002.00279; We expect that the capital expenditures in 2021 will be funded through either cash flows from operations or financing arrangements.; 0
0002.00280; We have committed to future aircraft purchases and have obtained, but are under no obligation to use, long-term financing commitments for a substantial portion of the purchase price of the aircraft.; 0
0002.00281; See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our aircraft purchase commitments.In connection with a dispute brought at the World Trade Organization against the EU and certain member states to address state subsidies in the large civil aircraft sector, the U.S. Trade Representative has imposed tariffs on certain products imported from the EU, including 15% tariffs on certain new aircraft and certain airplane parts originating in France and Germany.; 0
0002.00282; We are pursuing strategies to minimize the impact, if any, of these tariffs on our business.Equity Investments.; 0
0002.00283; In January 2020, we acquired 20% of the shares of LATAM for $1.9 billion, or $16 per share, through a tender offer. In addition, to support the establishment of our strategic alliance, we agreed to make transition payments to LATAM totaling $350 million, of which $75 million remains to be paid by the end of 2021.As part of our planned strategic alliance with LATAM, we have also assumed 10 of LATAM's A350 purchase commitments with Airbus for deliveries through 2025.; 0
0002.00284; We believe this alliance will generate growth opportunities, building upon Delta's and LATAM's global footprint and joint ventures.During 2020, we acquired through open market transactions, additional outstanding shares of Hanjin-KAL, the largest shareholder of Korean Air, for $158 million.; 0
0002.00285; As of December 31, 2020 our equity ownership interest in Hanjin-KAL was approximately 13%.; 0

0002.00304; As part of the terminal redevelopment project at LaGuardia Airport, we are partnering with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (Port Authority) to replace Terminals C and D with a new state-of-the-art terminal facility consisting of 37 gates across 4 concourses connected to a central headhouse.; 0
0002.00305; The terminal will feature a new, larger Delta Sky Club, wider concourses, more gate seating and 75% more concessions space than the existing terminals. The facility will also offer direct access between the parking garage and terminal and improved roadways and drop-off/pick-up areas. The design of the new terminal will integrate sustainable technologies and improvements in energy efficiency.; 0
0002.00306; Construction will be phased to limit passenger inconvenience and is expected to be completed by 2026.; 0
0002.00307; In connection with the redevelopment, during 2017, we entered into an amended and restated terminal lease with the Port Authority with a term through 2050.; 0
0002.00308; Pursuant to the lease agreement, as amended to date, we will (1) fund (through debt issuance and existing cash) and undertake the design, management and construction of the terminal and certain off-premises supporting facilities, (2) receive a Port Authority contribution of $481 million to facilitate construction of the terminal and other supporting infrastructure, (3) be responsible for all operations and maintenance during the term of the lease and (4) have preferential rights to all gates in the terminal subject to Port Authority requirements with respect to accommodation of designated carriers.; 0
0002.00309; We currently expect our net project cost to be approximately $3.5 billion and we bear the risks of project construction, including any potential cost over-runs. Using funding primarily provided by existing financing arrangements, we spent approximately $600 million during 2020, bringing the total amount spent on the project to date to approximately $1.5 billion.; 0
0002.00310; We expect to spend approximately $900 million during 2021, of which a substantial majority will be paid using cash restricted for airport construction.; 0

0002.00350; Passenger Ticket Sales Earning Miles.; 0
0002.00351; Passenger ticket sales earning miles provide customers with (1) miles earned and (2) air transportation, which are each considered performance obligations.; 0
0002.00352; We value each performance obligation on a standalone basis.; 0
0002.00353; To value the miles earned, we consider the quantitative value a passenger receives by redeeming miles for a ticket rather than paying cash, which is referred to as equivalent ticket value (ETV).; 0
0002.00354; Our estimate of ETV is adjusted for miles that are not likely to be redeemed (breakage).; 0
0002.00355; We use statistical models to estimate breakage based on historical redemption patterns. A change in assumptions to the redemption activity for miles or the estimated fair value of miles expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years.; 0
0002.00356; We recognize breakage proportionally during the period in which the remaining miles are actually redeemed.; 0
0002.00357; At December 31, 2020, the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the SkyMiles program was $7.2 billion.; 0
0002.00358; A hypothetical 10% change in the number of outstanding miles estimated to be redeemed would result in an impact of approximately $60 million on annual revenue recognized.We defer revenue for the miles when earned and recognize loyalty travel awards in passenger revenue as the miles are redeemed and transportation is provided.; 0
0002.00359; We record the air transportation portion of the passenger ticket sales in air traffic liability and recognize passenger revenue when we provide transportation or if the ticket goes unused.; 0
0002.00360; A hypothetical 10% increase in our estimate of the ETV of a mile would decrease annual passenger revenue by approximately $40 million, as a result of an increase in the amount of revenue deferred from the mileage component of passenger ticket sales.Sale of Miles to Participating Companies.; 0
0002.00361; Customers earn miles based on their spending with participating companies such as credit card companies, hotels, car rental agencies and ridesharing companies with which we have marketing agreements to sell miles.; 0
0002.00362; Our contracts to sell miles under these marketing agreements have multiple performance obligations.; 0
0002.00363; Payments are typically due to us monthly based on the volume of miles sold during the period, and the initial terms of our marketing contracts are from three to eleven years.; 0
0002.00364; During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, total cash sales from marketing agreements were $2.8 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, which are allocated to travel and other performance obligations, as discussed below. Delta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K ; 0

0002.00368; 46Item 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting EstimatesOur most significant contract to sell miles relates to our co-brand credit card relationship with American Express. Our agreements with American Express provide for joint marketing, grant certain benefits to Delta-American Express co-branded credit card holders (cardholders) and American Express Membership Rewards program participants, and allow American Express to market its services or products using our customer database.; 0
0002.00369; Cardholders earn miles for making purchases using co-branded cards, and certain cardholders may also check their first bag for free, are granted discounted access to Delta Sky Club lounges and receive priority boarding and other benefits while traveling on Delta.; 0
0002.00370; Additionally, participants in the American Express Membership Rewards program may exchange their points for miles under the loyalty program.; 0
0002.00371; We sell miles at agreed-upon rates to American Express which are then provided to their customers under the co-brand credit card program and the Membership Rewards program.; 0
0002.00372; Effective January 1, 2019, we amended our co-brand and other agreements with American Express which increased the value we receive and extended the terms to 2029.; 0
0002.00373; The products and services delivered are consistent with previous agreements.; 0
0002.00374; We account for marketing agreements, including those with American Express, by allocating the consideration received to the individual products and services delivered.; 0
0002.00375; We allocate the value based on the relative selling prices of those products and services, which generally consist of award travel, priority boarding, baggage fee waivers, lounge access and the use of our brand. We determine our best estimate of the selling prices by using a discounted cash flow analysis using multiple inputs and assumptions, including (1) the expected number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed, (2) ETV for the award travel obligation adjusted for breakage, (3) published rates on our website for baggage fees, discounted access to Delta Sky Club lounges and other benefits while traveling on Delta, (4) brand value (using estimated royalties generated from the use of our brand) and (5) volume discounts provided to certain partners.We defer the amount allocated to award travel as part of loyalty program deferred revenue and recognize loyalty travel awards in passenger revenue as the miles are redeemed and transportation is provided.; 0
0002.00376; Revenue allocated to services performed in conjunction with a passenger’s flight, such as baggage fee waivers, is recognized as travel-related services in passenger revenue when the related service is performed.; 0
0002.00377; Revenue allocated to access Delta Sky Club lounges is recognized as miscellaneous in other revenue as access is provided.; 0
0002.00378; Revenue allocated to the remaining performance obligations, primarily brand value, is recorded as loyalty program in other revenue as miles are delivered.; 0
0002.00379; For additional information on our significant accounting policies related to the loyalty program, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We apply a fair value-based impairment test to the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis (as of October 1) and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis.; 0
0002.00380; We assess the value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived assets under either a qualitative or quantitative approach.; 0
0002.00381; Under a qualitative approach, we consider various market factors, including certain of the key assumptions listed below.; 0
0002.00382; We analyze these factors to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.; 0
0002.00383; If we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset may be impaired, we use the quantitative approach to assess the asset's fair value and the amount of the impairment.; 0
0002.00384; Under a quantitative approach, we calculate the fair value of the asset incorporating the key assumptions listed below into our calculation.When we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a quantitative approach, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit by considering both comparable public company multiples (a market approach) and projected discounted future cash flows (an income approach). When we perform a quantitative impairment assessment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, fair value is estimated based on (1) recent market transactions, where available, (2) the royalty method for the Delta tradename (which assumes hypothetical royalties generated from using our tradename) or (3) projected discounted future cash flows (an income approach).; 0
0002.00385; Key Assumptions.; 0
0002.00386; The key assumptions in our impairment tests include (1) forecasted revenues, expenses and cash flows, including the duration and extent of impact to our business and our alliance partners from the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) current discount rates, (3) observable market transactions and (4) anticipated changes to the regulatory environment (e.g., diminished slot access, additional Open Skies agreements or changes to antitrust approvals).; 0
0002.00387; These assumptions are consistent with those that hypothetical market participants would use.; 0
0002.00388; Because we are required to make estimates and assumptions when evaluating goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, actual transaction amounts may differ materially from these estimates. In addition, when performing a qualitative valuation, we consider the amount by which the intangible assets' fair values exceeded their respective carrying values in the most recent fair value measurements calculated using a quantitative approach.Delta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K ; 0

0002.00394; MD&A - Critical Accounting EstimatesChanges in certain events and circumstances could result in impairment or a change from indefinite-lived to definite-lived. Factors which could cause impairment include, but are not limited to (1) negative trends in our market capitalization, (2) reduced profitability resulting from lower passenger mile yields or higher input costs (primarily related to fuel and employees), (3) lower passenger demand as a result of weakened U.S. and global economies, global pandemics or other factors, (4) interruption to our operations due to a prolonged employee strike, terrorist attack or other reasons, (5) changes to the regulatory environment (e.g., diminished slot access, additional Open Skies agreements or changes to antitrust approvals), (6) competitive changes by other airlines and (7) strategic changes to our operations leading to diminished utilization of the intangible assets.; 0
0002.00395; Goodwill.; 0
0002.00396; Our goodwill balance, which is related to the airline segment, was $9.8 billion at December 31, 2020.; 0
0002.00397; Based upon our quantitative assessment of all relevant factors, including applicable factors noted in Key Assumptions above in addition to the change in our market capitalization during the current year, we determined that the fair value of goodwill significantly exceeded the carrying value and, therefore, there was no indication that goodwill was impaired.Identifiable Intangible Assets. Our identifiable intangible assets, which are related to the airline segment, had a net carrying amount of $6.0 billion at December 31, 2020, of which $5.9 billion related to indefinite-lived intangible assets.; 0
0002.00398; Indefinite-lived assets are not amortized and consist of routes, slots, the Delta tradename and assets related to alliances and collaborative arrangements.; 0
0002.00399; Definite-lived assets consist primarily of marketing and maintenance service agreements.; 0
0002.00400; In 2020, we performed quantitative assessments of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including applicable factors noted in Key Assumptions above, and determined that there was no indication that the assets were impaired as the fair value of each asset exceeded its carrying value by at least 10%.; 0
0002.00401; Assumptions are sensitive to uncertainty about future events, the macroeconomic environment and other market-based risk factors.; 0
0002.00402; A change in key assumptions such as the discount rate or projected future revenues, expenses and cash flows could materially affect the determination of fair values.; 0
0002.00403; However, we believe the impact of the pandemic is temporary in nature and does not materially impact the long-range forecasts for our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles.; 0
0002.00404; Management evaluated estimates and assumptions used in the valuations, considering market and industry-specific conditions.For additional information on our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets' significant accounting policies and the related fair values and book values, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Property and Equipment, netOur flight equipment, which consists of aircraft and associated engines and parts, and other long-lived assets have a recorded value of $26.5 billion at December 31, 2020.; 0
0002.00405; This value is based on various factors, including the assets' estimated useful lives and salvage values.; 0
0002.00406; We review flight equipment and other long-lived assets used in operations for impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired.; 0
0002.00407; Factors which could be indicators of impairment include, but are not limited to (1) a decision to permanently remove flight equipment or other long-lived assets from operations, (2) significant changes in the estimated useful life, (3) significant changes in projected cash flows, (4) permanent and significant declines in fleet fair values and (5) changes to the regulatory environment.; 0
0002.00408; For long-lived assets held for sale, we discontinue depreciation and record impairment losses when the carrying amount of these assets is greater than the fair value less the cost to sell. To determine whether impairments exist for active and temporarily parked aircraft, we group assets at the fleet type level or at the contract level for aircraft operated by third-party regional carriers (i.e., the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity, passenger mile yield, fuel and labor costs and other relevant factors.; 0
0002.00409; Given the substantial reduction in our active aircraft and diminished projections of future cash flows in the near term as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we evaluated our fleet during 2020 and determined that only the fleet types discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements were impaired, as the future cash flows from the operation of all other fleet types through the respective retirement dates exceeded the carrying value.; 0
0002.00410; As we obtain greater clarity about the duration and extent of reduced demand and potentially execute further capacity adjustments, we will continue to evaluate our fleet compared to network requirements and may decide to retire additional aircraft.; 0
0002.00411; Future decisions regarding the temporarily parked aircraft and the timing of any return to service will be dependent on the evolution of the demand environment.; 0

0002.00418; MD&A - Critical Accounting EstimatesAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and our response, we have removed certain aircraft from active service as of December 31, 2020, which includes owned and leased aircraft that are being retired early. This resulted in impairment and other related charges of $4.4 billion, recorded in restructuring charges in our income statement.; 1
0002.00419; These charges were calculated using Level 3 fair value inputs based primarily upon recent market transactions and third-party bids, which were corroborated with published pricing guides and our assessment of existing market conditions based on industry knowledge.; 0
0002.00420; The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 created additional estimation uncertainty as there is currently a limited market for aircraft and limited data on how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the fair value of aircraft. Following the impairment charges, the remaining aggregate net book value of these aircraft as of December 31, 2020 is approximately $500 million. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding these impairments and related charges.Income Tax Valuation AllowanceWe periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets.; 0
0002.00421; We establish valuation allowances if it is not likely we will realize our deferred income tax assets. In making this determination, we consider available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions.; 0
0002.00422; We consider, among other things, projected future taxable income, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, our historical financial results and tax planning strategies.; 0
0002.00423; In evaluating the likelihood of utilizing our net deferred income tax assets, the significant factors that we consider include (1) our recent history of profitability, (2) growth in the U.S. and global economies, (3) forecast of airline revenue trends, (4) estimate of future fuel prices and (5) future impact of taxable temporary differences.At December 31, 2020 our net deferred tax asset balance was $2.0 billion, including a $460 million valuation allowance primarily related to capital loss carryforwards and state net operating losses.; 1
0002.00424; Although we are in a three year cumulative loss position as of December 31, 2020, we have a recent history of significant earnings prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.; 0
0002.00425; We expect to return to profitability as the effects of the pandemic subside and to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our federal net operating loss carryforwards before any expire. Our federal net operating loss carryforwards generated before 2018 do not begin to expire until 2027.; 0
0002.00426; Under current tax law, federal net operating losses generated in 2020 do not expire.; 0
0002.00427; Therefore, we have not recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets other than the capital loss carryforwards and state net operating losses that have short expiration periods.Defined Benefit Pension PlansWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees.; 0
0002.00428; These plans are closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals.; 0
0002.00429; As of December 31, 2020, the unfunded benefit obligation for these plans recorded on our balance sheet was $6.1 billion.; 0
0002.00430; We had no minimum funding requirements in 2019 or 2020, we have no such requirements in 2021, and based on our current projections, we do not expect any minimum required contributions until 2025. However, during 2019, we voluntarily contributed $1 billion to these plans.; 0
0002.00431; As a part of our liquidity initiatives we suspended voluntary pension funding that we were previously planning in 2020. We plan to contribute at least $500 million to these plans in 2021.; 0
0002.00432; The most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and net periodic benefit cost are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and life expectancy.Weighted Average Discount Rate.; 0
0002.00433; We determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high-quality fixed income investments and yield-to-maturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments.; 0
0002.00434; We used a weighted average discount rate to value the obligations of 2.62% and 3.40% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.; 0
0002.00435; Our weighted average discount rate for net periodic benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date, ranging from 3.40% to 4.33%.Expected Long-Term Rate of Return. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based primarily on plan-specific investment studies using historical market return and volatility data.; 0
0002.00436; Modest excess return expectations versus some public market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically.; 0
0002.00437; We also expect to receive a premium for investing in less liquid private markets. We review our rate of return on plan assets assumptions annually.; 0
0002.00438; Our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. The investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plan assets is to earn a long-term return that meets or exceeds our annualized return target while taking an acceptable level of risk and maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay current benefits and other cash obligations of the plan.; 0
0002.00439; This is achieved by investing in a globally diversified mix of public and private equity, fixed income, real assets, hedge funds and other assets and instruments.; 0
0002.00440; Our weighted average expected long-term rate of return on assets for net periodic benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 8.97%.Delta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K  ; 0

0002.00446; The SOA publishes updated mortality tables for U.S. plans and updated improvement scales.; 0
0002.00447; Each year we consider updates by the SOA in setting our mortality assumptions for purposes of measuring pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations.Funding.; 0
0002.00448; Our funding obligations for qualified defined benefit plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding rules (Alternative Funding Rules) for defined benefit plans that are frozen. We elected the Alternative Funding Rules under which the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be amortized over a fixed 17-year period and is calculated using an 8.85% discount rate until the 17-year period expires for all frozen defined benefit plans by the end of 2024.While the Pension Protection Act makes our funding obligations for these plans more predictable, factors outside our control continue to have an impact on the funding requirements.; 0
0002.00449; Estimates of future funding requirements are based on various assumptions and can vary materially from actual funding requirements.; 0

0002.00452; On an annual basis we assess the potential for adjustments to the fair value of all investments.; 0
0002.00453; These investments valued using NAV as a practical expedient are typically valued on a monthly or quarterly basis by third-party administrators, valuation agents or fund managers with an annual audit performed by an independent third party, but certain of these investments have a lag in the availability of data.; 0
0002.00454; This primarily applies to private equity, private equity-related strategies and real assets.; 0
0002.00455; We solicit valuation updates from the investment fund managers and use their information and corroborating data from public markets to determine any needed fair value adjustments.; 0

0002.00547; QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe have market risk exposure related to fuel prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.; 0
0002.00548; Market risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In an effort to manage our exposure to these risks, we may enter into derivative contracts and may adjust our derivative portfolio as market conditions change. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our derivative contracts.; 0
0002.00549; We expect adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments to result in ongoing volatility in earnings and stockholders' equity.The following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects of a change in demand for air travel, the economy as a whole or actions we may take to seek to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk.; 0
0002.00550; For these and other reasons, the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical results.Fuel Price RiskChanges in fuel prices materially impact our results of operations. A one cent increase in the cost of jet fuel would result in approximately $40 million of additional annual fuel expense based on annual pre-COVID-19 pandemic consumption of approximately four billion gallons of jet fuel.; 0
0002.00551; As a result of the reduced capacity from the COVID-19 pandemic, our jet fuel consumption during 2020 of 1.9 billion gallons was significantly less than our historical and expected future consumption.; 0
0002.00552; Our derivative contracts to hedge the financial risk from changing fuel prices are primarily related to Monroe’s inventory.; 0
0002.00553; Interest Rate RiskOur exposure to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates is primarily associated with our debt obligations.; 0
0002.00554; Market risk associated with our fixed and variable rate debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future earnings, respectively, from an increase in interest rates.; 0
0002.00555; At December 31, 2020, we had $22.3 billion of fixed-rate debt and $5.9 billion of variable-rate debt.; 0
0002.00556; The rates used in our variable-rate debt are based on LIBOR, or another index rate, which in certain cases is subject to a floor.; 0
0002.00557; An increase of 100 basis points in average annual interest rates would have decreased the estimated fair value of our fixed-rate debt by $1.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and would have increased the annual interest expense on our variable-rate debt and variable-rate leases by $29 million.; 0
0002.00558; The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced in 2017 that it intends to no longer compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) after 2021.; 0
0002.00559; In December 2020, the administrator of LIBOR proposed to cease publication of certain LIBOR settings after December 2021 and to cease publication of the remainder of the LIBOR settings after June 2023. To mitigate the possible impact of this change, various regulators have proposed alternative reference rates.; 0
0002.00560; The effect of any discontinuation or replacement of LIBOR cannot be predicted at this time, but we believe our risk would be limited to variable-rate debt and variable-rate finance leases which utilize rates for which the settings are to be discontinued after June 2023 because we have an immaterial amount of contracts that utilize the settings to be discontinued immediately after December 2021.; 0
0002.00561; At December 31, 2020 we had approximately $3.8 billion of variable-rate debt and variable-rate finance leases maturing after June 2023, all of which include provisions to update the applicable reference rate, and we do not expect this rate to be materially different from LIBOR.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk because we have revenue, expense and equity investments denominated in foreign currencies. To manage exchange rate risk, we execute both our international revenue and expense transactions in the same foreign currency to the extent practicable.; 0
0002.00562; From time to time, we may also enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts.; 0
0002.00563; At December 31, 2020, we had a U.S. dollar-South Korean won cross currency swap contract totaling a $13 million liability position.; 0
0002.00564; We estimate that a 10% depreciation or appreciation in the price of the South Korean won in relation to the U.S. dollar would have changed the projected cash settlement value of our open hedge contract by $17 million for the year ending December 31, 2020.Delta Air Lines, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K ; 0
