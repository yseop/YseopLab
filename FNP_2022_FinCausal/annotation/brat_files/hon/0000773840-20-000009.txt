Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesAccounting Principles—The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The following is a description of Honeywell’s significant accounting policies.Principles of Consolidation—The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Honeywell International Inc. and all of its subsidiaries and entities in which a controlling interest is maintained.
Our consolidation policy requires equity investments that we exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee’s activities to be accounted for using the equity method.
Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which we do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.
All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.Property, Plant and Equipment—Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including any asset retirement obligations, less accumulated depreciation.
For financial reporting, the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and 2 to 16 years for machinery and equipment.
Recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs.
Upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding asset’s useful life.Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets—Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value.
We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2019 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date.Other Intangible Assets with Determinable Lives—Other intangible assets with determinable lives consist of customer lists, technology, patents and trademarks and other intangibles and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 24 years.Sales Recognition—Product and service sales are recognized when or as the Company transfers control of the promised products or services to its customers.
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services.
Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance and engineering activities are recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered.
Sales under long-term contracts with performance obligations satisfied over time are recognized using either an input or output method.
We recognize revenue over time as we perform on these contracts because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer.
With control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation.
We generally use the cost-to-cost input method of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs.
Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation.
We review our cost estimates on significant contracts on a periodic basis, or when circumstances change and warrant a modification to a previous estimate.
Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections.
Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.
Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full when such losses become evident, to the extent required.The customer funding for costs incurred for nonrecurring engineering and development activities of our products under agreements with commercial customers is deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue as products are delivered to the customers.
Additionally, expenses incurred, up to the customer agreed funded amount, are deferred as an asset and recognized as cost of sales when products are delivered to the customer.
The deferred customer funding and costs result in recognition of deferred costs (asset) and deferred revenue (liability) on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Capitalized contract fulfillment costs were approximately $1 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.
The amounts recognized as cost of sales were approximately $0.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
38HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Revenues for our mechanical service programs are recognized as performance obligations are satisfied over time, with recognition reflecting a series of distinct services using the output method.The terms of a contract or the historical business practice can give rise to variable consideration due to, but not limited to, cash-based incentives, rebates, performance awards, or credits.
We estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount we will receive from customers.
We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized for such transaction will not occur, or when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.
Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us.For the year ended 2017, prior to the adoption of the revenue recognition standard (see Note 7 Revenue Recognition and Contracts with Customers), product and service sales were recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed, product delivery had occurred or services had been rendered, pricing was fixed or determinable, and collection was reasonably assured.
Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance and engineering activities were recognized over the contractual period or as services were rendered.
Sales under long-term contracts were recorded on a percentage-of-completion method measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts.
Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts were recorded in full when such losses became evident.
Revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements were recognized as each element was earned based on the relative fair value of each element provided the delivered elements had value to customers on a standalone basis.
Amounts allocated to each element were based on its objectively determined fair value, such as the sales price for the product or service when it was sold separately or competitor prices for similar products or services.Environmental—The Company accrues costs related to environmental matters when it is probable that we have incurred a liability related to a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
For additional information, see Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies.Asbestos Related Liabilities and Insurance Recoveries—The Company recognizes a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable.
In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable.
For additional information, see Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies.Reimbursement Receivables—In conjunction with the Garrett Motion Inc. (“Garrett”) and Resideo Technologies, Inc. (“Resideo”) spin-offs, the Company entered into reimbursement agreements under which Honeywell receives cash payments as reimbursement primarily for asbestos related liability payments related to the Bendix business in the U.S. (Garrett) and net spending for environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the agreement (Resideo).
Accordingly, the Company has recorded a receivable based on estimates in the underlying reimbursable Honeywell spend, and we monitor the recoverability of such receivable, which is subject to terms of applicable credit agreements and general ability to pay.
For additional information, see Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies.Aerospace Sales Incentives—The Company provides sales incentives to commercial aircraft manufacturers and airlines in connection with their selection of its aircraft equipment, predominately wheel and braking system hardware, avionics, and auxiliary power units, for installation on commercial aircraft.
These incentives consist of free or deeply discounted products, credits for future purchases of product or upfront cash payments.
These costs are generally recognized in the period incurred as cost of products sold or as a reduction to relevant sales, as appropriate.Research and Development—Research and development costs for company-sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred.
Such costs are included in cost of products and services sold and were $1,556 million, $1,809 million and $1,835 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Customer-sponsored research and development activities under contracts with customers are included as a contract cost and included in cost of products and services sold when revenue from such contracts is recognized.
Such customer-sponsored research and development activities amounted to an additional $1,079 million, $1,069 million and $876 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017.39HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Stock-Based Compensation Plans—The principal awards issued under our stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 19 Stock-Based Compensation Plans, are non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units.
The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award.
The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award) and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant to recognize expense for those awards that are expected to vest and are based on our historical forfeiture rates.Pension Benefits—The Company presents net periodic pensions costs by disaggregating the service cost component of net benefit costs and reports those costs in the same line item or items in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period.
The other non-service components of net benefit costs are required to be presented separately from the service cost component.The Company records the service cost component of Pension ongoing (income) expense in Costs of products and services sold and Selling, general and administrative expenses.
The remaining components of net benefit costs within Pension ongoing (income) expense, primarily interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recorded in Other (income) expense.
We recognize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation (the corridor) annually in the fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment).
The MTM Adjustment is also reported in Other (income) expense.Foreign Currency Translation—Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than U.S.
Dollars are translated into U.S.
Dollars using year-end exchange rates.
Sales, costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year.
Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates.
Remeasurement adjustments for these subsidiaries are included in earnings.Derivative Financial Instruments—The Company reduces our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risk and are not used for trading or other speculative purposes.
We do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments.
Derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract.
Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract.All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value.
For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair values of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current earnings.
For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact earnings.
Cash flows of such derivative financial instruments are classified consistent with the underlying hedged item.
We have elected to exclude the time value of the derivatives (i.e., the forward points) from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize the initial value of the excluded component in earnings using the amortization approach.
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the gain or loss is reported as a component of Other comprehensive income (loss) and recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated.40HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Income Taxes—Significant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions.
We establish reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold.
The approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance which determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority.
In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities.
We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change in estimate become known.
For discussion of the impacts from what is commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“U.S Tax Reform”), see Note 5 Income Taxes.Cash and cash equivalents—Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less.Earnings Per Share—Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding.Reclassifications—Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.Leases—At the inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease.
The assessment is based on (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (3) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.All significant lease arrangements are generally recognized at lease commencement.
Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement.
An ROU asset and corresponding lease liability are not recorded for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less (short term leases), and we recognize lease expense for these leases as incurred over the lease term.
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset during the reasonably certain lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.
Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.
Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.
Lease payments may be fixed or variable, however, only fixed payments or in-substance fixed payments are included in determining the lease liability.
Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments are incurred.
The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments related to initial direct cost and prepayments and excludes lease incentives.
Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately.The Company primarily uses our incremental borrowing rate, which is based on the information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of the lease payments.
In determining the borrowing rate, we consider the lease term, secured incremental borrowing rate, and for leases denominated in a currency different than U.S. dollar, the collateralized borrowing rate in the foreign currency using the U.S. dollar and foreign currency swap spread, when available.Recent Accounting Pronouncements—The Company considers the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).
ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows (consolidated financial statements).In December 2019, the FASB issued accounting standard update to simplify the accounting for income taxes.
The standard’s amendments include changes in various subtopics of accounting for income taxes including, but not limited to, accounting for “hybrid” tax regimes, tax basis step-up in goodwill obtained in a transaction that is not a business combination, intraperiod tax allocation exception to incremental approach, ownership changes in investments, interim-period accounting for enacted changes in tax law, and year-to date loss limitation in interim-period tax accounting.
The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 with early adoption permitted, including the 41HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)interim periods within those years.
We are currently evaluating impacts of these amendments on our Consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and related notes to the Financial Statements.
In February 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows for an entity to elect to reclassify the income tax effects on items resulting from what is commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("U.S. Tax Reform") from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings.
The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted, including interim periods within those years.
The Company has elected to not reclassify the stranded income tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings.In June 2016, the FASB issued accounting standard that requires companies to utilize an impairment model (current expected credit loss, or CECL) for most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other financial instruments, which include, but are not limited to, trade and other receivables.
This accounting standard will replace the incurred loss model under current GAAP with a model that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to estimate those losses.
Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted this standard.
The adoption of this standard does not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.Note 2.
Acquisitions and DivestituresDuring 2019, there were no significant acquisitions individually or in aggregate.
During 2018, the Company acquired businesses for an aggregate cost (net of cash and debt assumed) of approximately $535 million, mainly due to the November 2018 acquisition of Transnorm, a global leader in high-performance conveyor and warehouse solutions, including approximately $380 million allocated to goodwill.
Transnorm is part of Safety and Productivity Solutions.
The goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes.During 2017, there were no significant acquisitions individually or in the aggregate.On October 1, 2018, the Company completed the tax-free spin-off to Honeywell shareowners of its Transportation Systems business, part of Aerospace, into a standalone publicly-traded company, Garrett Motion Inc. (“Garrett”).
On October 29, 2018, the Company completed the tax-free spin-off to Honeywell shareowners of its Homes and Global Distribution business, part of Home and Building Technologies (renamed Honeywell Building Technologies following the spin-off), into a standalone publicly-traded company, Resideo Technologies, Inc. (“Resideo”).
The assets of approximately $5.5 billion, including approximately $2.8 billion of goodwill and net of recorded receivables, and liabilities of approximately $7.2 billion associated with spin-off entities have been removed through Retained Earnings from the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the effective date of the spin-off.
The results of operations and cash flows are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows through the effective date of the spin-off.
The Income before taxes attributable to the spin-off businesses were $0.4 billion and $0.5 billion for 2018 and 2017.Honeywell shareowners of record as of the close of business on October 16, 2018 received one share of Resideo common stock for every 6 shares of Honeywell common stock.
Immediately prior to the effective date of the spin-off, Resideo incurred debt of $1.2 billion to make a cash distribution to the Company.Honeywell shareowners of record as of the close of business on September 18, 2018 received one share of Garrett common stock for every 10 shares of Honeywell common stock.
Immediately prior to the effective date of the spin-off, Garrett incurred debt of $1.6 billion to make a cash distribution to the Company.In 2018 in connection with the spin-off, the Company entered into certain agreements with Resideo and Garrett to affect our legal and structural separation, including transition services agreements to provide certain administrative and other services for a limited time, and tax matters and indemnification and reimbursement agreements.
As of the end of 2019, most of those agreements are still in effect.42HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Note 3.

The increase was primarily attributable to a lower income tax benefit resulting from revised guidance related to U.S. Tax Reform and internal restructuring initiatives that resulted in a $281 million reduction of accrued withholding taxes related to unremitted foreign earnings when compared to the prior year.
The Company’s non-U.S. effective tax rate was 26.1%, an increase of approximately 22.0 percentage points compared to 2018.
The increase in the foreign effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a lower income tax benefit related to the Company’s internal restructuring initiatives when compared to the prior year.
The effective tax rate decreased by 68.4 percentage points in 2018 compared to 2017.
The decrease was primarily attributable to internal restructuring initiatives that resulted in a reduction of accrued withholding taxes of approximately $1.1 billion related to unremitted foreign earnings.
In addition, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $440 million as a reduction to our 2017 provisional estimate of impacts from U.S. Tax Reform, which was partially offset by $411 million of tax costs associated with the internal restructuring of the Homes and Global Distribution business and Transportation Systems business in advance of their spin-offs.
The Company’s non-U.S. effective tax rate was 4.1%, a decrease of approximately 67.3 percentage points compared to 2017.
The year over year decrease in the foreign effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the impact of the Company’s internal restructuring initiatives and the reduction of accrued withholding taxes on unremitted foreign earnings, partially offset by the spin-off transactions.46HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Deferred tax assets (liabilities)The tax effects of temporary differences and tax carryforwards which give rise to future income tax benefits and payables are as follows:Deferred tax assets:December 31,2019 2018Postretirement benefits other than pensions$111 $120Asbestos and environmental531 589Employee compensation and benefits205 262Other accruals and reserves279 336Net operating and capital losses652 688Tax credit carryforwards246 154Gross deferred tax assets2,024 2,149Valuation allowance(656) (689)Total deferred tax assets$1,368 $1,460Deferred tax liabilities: Pension$(469) $(40)Property, plant and equipment(469) (422)Intangibles(1,296) (1,553)Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries(419) (616)Other asset basis differences(136) (110)Other(163) (50)Total deferred tax liabilities(2,952) (2,791)Net deferred tax liability$(1,584) $(1,331)The Company's gross deferred tax assets include $767 million related to non-U.S. operations comprised principally of net operating losses, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards (mainly in Canada, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom) and deductible temporary differences.
We maintain a valuation allowance of $653 million against a portion of the non-U.S. gross deferred tax assets.
The change in the valuation allowance resulted in a decrease of $23 million and increases of $57 million and $4 million to income tax expense in 2019, 2018 and 2017.
In the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, we will reduce such amounts through an increase to income tax expense in the period such determination is made.
Conversely, if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a reduction to income tax expense in the period that such determination is made.As of December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a $419 million deferred tax liability on all of our unremitted foreign earnings based on estimated earnings and profits of approximately $16.7 billion as of the balance sheet date.As of December 31, 2019, the Company's net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards were as follows:JurisdictionExpirationPeriod Net Operatingand Capital LossCarryforwards Tax CreditCarryforwardsU.S.

In addition, the outcome of these examinations may impact the valuation of certain deferred tax assets (such as net operating losses) in future periods.Unrecognized tax benefits for examinations in progress were $413 million, $304 million and $487 million, as of December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.
Estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes are classified as a component of Tax expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and totaled $73 million, $45 million and $28 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.
Accrued interest and penalties were $487 million, $426 million and $423 million, as of December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.48HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)U.S. Tax ReformDuring the quarter ending December 31, 2018, the Company completed the accounting for the tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform which amounted to a total tax charge of approximately $3.5 billion, most of which was recorded as a provisional estimate at the end of 2017.
During 2018, we reduced our provisional estimate by approximately $440 million as a reduction to Tax expense.Corporate Tax Rate Change—During the years 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded a total tax benefit of approximately $190 million due to the decrease in the corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%.
This includes a measurement period adjustment of approximately $90 million recorded during 2018 as a reduction to Tax expense.
The change in the provisional estimate primarily relates to information contained in tax returns that were filed during the quarter ending December 31, 2018, some of which require approval from U.S. tax authorities.
The tax benefit from the change in tax rates results from the Company’s deferred tax liability position for the excess of its net book value over its tax basis of its U.S. assets and liabilities that will generate future taxable income in excess of book income.
This additional taxable income will be subject to tax at a lower corporate tax rate, consequently reducing the Company’s deferred tax liability.Mandatory Transition Tax—During the years 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded a total tax charge of approximately $1,950 million due to the imposition of the mandatory transition tax (“MTT”) on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings.
This includes a measurement period adjustment of approximately $50 million recorded during 2018 as an increase to Tax expense.
The change in the provisional estimate primarily relates to updated amounts from tax returns that were finalized during 2018, computations based on 2018 testing dates and guidance from the taxing authorities that was received during the year.
The Company has elected to pay the MTT liability over a period of eight years.Undistributed Foreign Earnings—During the years 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded a total tax charge of approximately $1,700 million due to the Company’s intent to no longer permanently reinvest the historical unremitted earnings of its foreign affiliates that existed as of December 31, 2017.
This includes a measurement period adjustment of approximately $400 million recorded during 2018 as a reduction to Tax expense.
The change in the provisional estimate primarily relates to updated amounts from tax returns that were finalized during 2018, the application of foreign tax credits based on guidance issued during the year and changes to the applicable withholding tax rates in local jurisdictions.
The Company also reduced these taxes on unremitted foreign earnings by $281 million and $1.1 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively, that were recorded as reductions to Tax expense.Global Intangible Low Taxed Income—U.S.
Tax Reform imposes a U.S. tax on global intangible low taxed income (“GILTI”) that is earned by certain foreign affiliates owned by a U.S. shareholder.
GILTI is generally intended to impose tax on the earnings of a foreign corporation that are deemed to exceed a certain threshold return relative to the underlying business investment.
The Company has made a policy election to treat future taxes related to GILTI as a current period expense in the reporting period in which the tax is incurred.49HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Note 6.

The disaggregation of our revenue based off timing of recognition is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018Products, transferred point in time61% 67%Products, transferred over time14 12Net product sales75 79Services, transferred point in time9 7Services, transferred over time16 14Net service sales25 21Net sales100% 100%Contract BalancesProgress on satisfying performance obligations under contracts with customers and the related billings and cash collections are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Accounts receivable - net and Other assets (unbilled receivables (contract assets) and billed receivables) and Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities (customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities)).
Unbilled receivables (contract assets) arise when the timing of cash collected from customers differs from the timing of revenue recognition, such as when contract provisions require specific milestones to be met before a customer can be billed.
Those assets are recognized when the revenue associated with the contract is recognized prior to billing and derecognized when billed in accordance with the terms of the contract.
Contract liabilities are recorded when customers remit contractual cash payments in advance of us satisfying performance obligations under contractual arrangements, including those with performance obligations to be satisfied over a period of time.
Contract liabilities are derecognized when revenue is recorded, either when a milestone is met triggering the contractual right to bill or when the performance obligation is satisfied.52HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Contract balances are classified as assets or liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.The following table summarizes the Company's contract assets and liabilities balances: 2019 2018Contract assets—January 1$1,548 $1,721Contract assets—December 311,602 1,548Change in contract assets—increase (decrease)$54 $(173)Contract liabilities—January 1$(3,378) $(2,973)Contract liabilities—December 31(3,501) (3,378)Change in contract liabilities—(increase) decrease$(123) $(405)Net change$(69) $(578)The net change in 2019 was primarily driven by the receipt of advance payments from customers exceeding recognition of revenue as performance obligations were satisfied prior to billing.
The net change in 2018 was primarily driven by the receipt of advance payments from customers exceeding reductions from recognition of revenue as performance obligations were satisfied and related billings.
For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized revenue of $1,543 million and $1,166 million that was previously included in the beginning balance of contract liabilities.When contracts are modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements, the Company considers whether the modification either creates new or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations.
Contract modifications for goods or services and not distinct from the existing contract, due to the significant integration with the original good or service provided, are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract.
The effect of a contract modification on the transaction price and our measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue) on a cumulative catch-up basis.
When the modifications include additional performance obligations that are distinct and at relative stand-alone selling price, they are accounted for as a new contract and performance obligation, which are recognized prospectively.Performance ObligationsA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is defined as the unit of account.
A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.
When our contracts with customers require highly complex integration or manufacturing services that are not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, not distinct, then the entire contract is accounted for as a single performance obligation.
In situations when our contract includes distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer over time, they are recognized as a series of distinct goods or services.
For any contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract.
For product sales, each product sold to a customer typically represents a distinct performance obligation.
In such cases, the observable standalone sales are used to determine the stand alone selling price.
Performance obligations are satisfied as of a point in time or over time.
Performance obligations are supported by contracts with customers, providing a framework for the nature of the distinct goods, services or bundle of goods and services.
The timing of satisfying the performance obligation is typically indicated by the terms of the contract.

Our disclosure of the timing for satisfying the performance obligation is based on the requirements of contracts with customers.
However, from time to time, these contracts may be subject to modifications, impacting the timing of satisfying the performance obligations.
Performance obligations expected to be satisfied within one year and greater than one year are 57% and 43%.The timing of satisfaction of the Company's performance obligations does not significantly vary from the typical timing of payment.
Typical payment terms of our fixed-price over time contracts include progress payments based on specified events or milestones, or based on project progress.
For some contracts we may be entitled to receive an advance payment.The Company has applied the practical expedient for certain revenue streams to exclude the value of remaining performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less or (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue in proportion to the amount we have the right to invoice for services performed.Note 8.

LeasesAdoptionEffective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new lease accounting standard using the modified retrospective method of applying the new standard at the adoption date.
In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard.
This allowed us to carry forward the historical lease classification.
Adoption of this standard resulted in the recording of net operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and corresponding operating lease liabilities of $0.7 billion.
Financial position for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 are presented under the new guidance, while prior periods amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with previous guidance.A significant portion of the Company's operating and finance lease portfolio includes corporate offices, research and development facilities, manufacturing sites, information technology (IT) equipment, and automobiles.
The majority of our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for 5 years or more.
Operating lease ROU assets are presented within Other assets.
The current portion of operating lease liabilities are presented within Accrued liabilities, and the non-current portion of operating lease liabilities are presented within Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Finance lease assets are included in Property, plant and equipment - net, and the finance lease obligations are included in Current maturities of long-term debt, and in Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.58HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)A portion of the Company's real estate leases is generally subject to annual changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
The changes to the CPI are treated as variable lease payments and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments was incurred.
In addition, a subset of our automobile leases is considered variable.
The variable lease payments for such automobiles leases are based on actual mileage incurred at the stated contractual rate and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments was incurred.

Financial Instruments and Fair Value MeasuresCredit and Market Risk—Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose the Company to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest and currency exchange rates.
Our counterparties in derivative transactions are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments.The Company continually monitors the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business.
The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer.
Our sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers.Foreign Currency Risk Management—The Company conducts business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies.
Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and transactions arising from international trade.
Our primary objective is to preserve the U.S. Dollar value of foreign currency denominated cash flows and earnings.
We monitor our collective foreign currency exposure and enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts (foreign currency exchange contracts) with third parties, when necessary, to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.The Company has monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
Prior to conversion into U.S. dollars, these assets and liabilities are remeasured at spot exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date.
The effects of changes in spot rates are recognized in earnings and included in other (income) expense.
We may purchase or enter into derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure.
We hedge forecasted sales and purchases, which are denominated in non-functional currencies, with foreign currency exchange contracts.
Changes in the forecasted non-functional currency cash flows due to movements in exchange rates are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange contracts designated as hedges.
Market value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had contracts with notional amounts of $12,746 million and $14,995 million to exchange foreign currencies, principally the U.S. Dollar, Euro, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Mexican Peso, Chinese Renminbi, Indian Rupee, Malaysian Ringgit, and Swiss Franc.
As of December 31, 2019, we estimate that approximately $52 million of net derivative gains related to our cash flow hedges included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months.The Company has also designated foreign currency debt and certain derivative contracts as hedges against portions of its net investment in foreign operations during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Gains or losses of the foreign currency debt and derivative contracts designated as a net investment hedge are recorded in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments.
Interest Rate Risk Management—Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose the Company to market risk related to changes in interest rates.
The Company uses a combination of financial instruments, including long-term, medium-term and short-term financing, variable-rate commercial paper, and interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing.
At December 31, 2019 and 2018, interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges effectively changed $3,950 million and $2,600 million of fixed rate debt at 2.87% and 2.93% to LIBOR based floating rate debt.
Our interest rate swaps mature at various dates through 2029.61HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Fair Value of Financial Instruments—The accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy.•Level 1-Inputs are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.•Level 2-Inputs are based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical or similar assets and liabilities.
•Level 3-One or more inputs are unobservable and significant.Financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2019 and 2018: December 31,2019 2018Assets: Foreign currency exchange contracts$291 $119Available for sale investments1,523 1,784Interest rate swap agreements38 20Cross currency swap agreements51 32Liabilities: Foreign currency exchange contracts$21 $4Interest rate swap agreements13 65The foreign currency exchange contracts, interest rate swap agreements, and cross currency swap agreements are valued using broker quotations, or market transactions in either the listed or over-the-counter markets.
As such, these derivative instruments are classified within level 2.
The Company also holds investments in commercial paper, certificates of deposits, and time deposits that are designated as available for sale and are valued using published prices based off observable market data.
As such, these investments are classified within level 2.
The Company also holds available for sale investments in U.S. government and corporate debt securities valued utilizing published prices based on quoted market pricing, which are classified within level 1.The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts and notes receivables, payables, commercial paper (of which $3,513 million and $3,583 million was Euro denominated as of December 31, 2019 and 2018) and short-term borrowings contained in the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximates fair value.The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that were not carried at fair value: December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018CarryingValue FairValue CarryingValue FairValueAssets

As such, the fair value of these receivables is considered level 2.
The Company determined the fair value of the long-term debt and related current maturities utilizing transactions in the listed markets for identical or similar liabilities.
As such, the fair value of the long-term debt and related current maturities is considered level 2.Interest rate swap agreements are designated as hedge relationships with gains or losses on the derivative recognized in interest and other financial charges offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying debt being hedged.
Gains and losses on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $70 million of income, $37 million of expense and $29 million of expense in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Gains and losses are fully offset by losses and gains on the underlying debt being hedged.The Company economically hedges its exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally with forward contracts.
These contracts are marked-to-market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings offsetting the gains and losses on the non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being hedged.
We recognized $106 million of income, $394 million of income, and $207 million of expense in Other (income) expense in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.

Options generally vest over a four-year period and expire after ten years.The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock and historical volatility of our common stock.
We used a Monte Carlo simulation model to derive an expected term which represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding.
Such model uses historical data to estimate option exercise activity and post-vest termination behavior.
The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.The following table summarizes the impact to the Consolidated Statement of Operations from stock options: Years Ended December 31,2019 2018 2017Compensation expense$47 $64 $79Future income tax benefit recognized10 13 1767HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)The following table sets forth fair value per share information, including related weighted-average assumptions, used to determine compensation cost.

Commitments and ContingenciesEnvironmental MattersThe Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment.
We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations.
However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances.
Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future.With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, the Company continually conducts studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques.
It is our policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work.
The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available.
Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible 70HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities.
We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow.
The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of remedial investigations and feasibility studies, the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties.The following table summarizes information concerning the Company's recorded liabilities for environmental costs: Years Ended December 31,2019 2018 2017Beginning of year$755 $595 $511Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable213 395 287Environmental liability payments(256) (218) (212)Other(3) (17) 9End of year$709 $755 $595Environmental liabilities are included in the following balance sheet accounts: December 31,2019 2018Accrued liabilities$222 $175Other liabilities487 580 $709 $755The Company does not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of environmental liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined although they could be material to our consolidated results of operations and operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid.
However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position.In conjunction with the Resideo spin-off, the Company entered into an indemnification and reimbursement agreement with a Resideo subsidiary, pursuant to which Resideo’s subsidiary has an ongoing obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell in amounts equal to 90 percent of Honeywell’s annual net spending for environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the agreement.
The amount payable to Honeywell in any given year is subject to a cap of $140 million, and the obligation will continue until the earlier of December 31, 2043, or December 31 of the third consecutive year during which the annual payment obligation has been less than $25 million.
Reimbursements associated with this agreement were $140 million and $25 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively and offset operating cash outflows incurred by the Company.
As the Company records the accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable related to the sites covered by the indemnification and reimbursement agreement, a corresponding receivable from Resideo for 90 percent of that accrual is also recorded.
This receivable amount recorded in 2019 and 2018, subsequent to the spin-off, was $109 million and $50 million.
As of December 31, 2019, Other Current Assets and Other Assets includes $140 million and $445 million representing the short-term and long-term portion of the receivable amount due from Resideo under the indemnification and reimbursement agreement.
As of December 31, 2018, Other Current Assets and Other Assets includes $140 million and $476 million representing the short-term and long-term portion of the receivable amount due from Resideo under the indemnification and reimbursement agreement.Asbestos MattersHoneywell is named in asbestos related personal injury claims related to North American Refractories Company (“NARCO”), which was sold in 1986, and Bendix Friction Materials (“Bendix”) business, which was sold in 2014.71HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)The following tables summarize information concerning NARCO and Bendix asbestos related balances:Asbestos Related Liabilities Year Ended December 31, 2019 Year Ended December 31, 2018 Year Ended December 31, 2017 Bendix NARCO Total Bendix NARCO Total Bendix NARCO TotalBeginning of year$1,623 $891 $2,514 $1,703 $907 $2,610 $1,789 $919 $2,708Accrual for update to estimated liability78 22 100 197 32 229 199 31 230Change in estimated cost of future claims(22) — (22) (72) — (72) (65) — (65)Update of expected resolution values for pending claims(4) — (4) 1 — 1 3 — 3Asbestos related liability payments(176) (55) (231) (206) (48) (254) (223) (43) (266)End of year$1,499 $858 $2,357 $1,623 $891 $2,514 $1,703 $907 $2,610Insurance Recoveries for Asbestos Related Liabilities Year Ended December 31, 2019 Year Ended December 31, 2018 Year Ended December 31, 2017 Bendix NARCO Total Bendix NARCO Total Bendix NARCO TotalBeginning of year$170 $307 $477 $191 $312 $503 $201 $319 $520Probable insurance recoveries related to estimated liability3 — 3 11 — 11 10 — 10Insurance receipts for asbestos related liabilities(39) (29) (68) (33) (5) (38) (20) (7) (27)Insurance receivables settlements and write offs19 3 22 1 — 1 — — —Other— — — — — — — — —End of year$153 $281 $434 $170 $307 $477 $191 $312 $503NARCO and Bendix asbestos related balances are included in the following balance sheet accounts: December 31,2019 2018Other current assets$42 $40Insurance recoveries for asbestos related liabilities392 437 $434 $477Accrued liabilities$361 $245Asbestos related liabilities1,996 2,269 $2,357 $2,514NARCO Products—Honeywell’s predecessor, Allied Corporation owned NARCO from 1979 to 1986.
When the NARCO business was sold, Honeywell’s predecessor entered into a cross-indemnity agreement with NARCO which included an obligation to indemnify the purchaser for asbestos claims.
Such claims arise primarily from alleged occupational exposure to asbestos-containing refractory brick and mortar for high-temperature applications.
NARCO ceased manufacturing these products in 1980, and the first asbestos claims were filed in the tort system against NARCO in 1983.
Claims filings and related costs increased dramatically in the late 1990s through 2001, which led to NARCO filing for bankruptcy in January 2002.
Once NARCO filed for bankruptcy, all then current and future NARCO asbestos claims were stayed against both NARCO and Honeywell pending the reorganization of NARCO.72HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Following the bankruptcy filing, in December 2002 Honeywell recorded a total NARCO asbestos liability of $3.2 billion, which was comprised of three components: (i) the estimated liability to settle pre-bankruptcy petition NARCO claims and certain post-petition settlements ($2.2 billion, referred to as “Pre-bankruptcy NARCO Liability”), (ii) the estimated liability related to then unasserted NARCO claims for the period 2004 through 2018 ($950 million, referred to as “NARCO Trust Liability”), and (iii) other NARCO bankruptcy-related obligations totaling $73 million.When the NARCO Trust Liability of $950 million was established in 2002, the methodology for estimating the potential liability was based primarily on: (a) epidemiological projections of the future incidence of disease for the period 2004 through 2018, a fifteen-year period; (b) historical claims rates in the tort system for the five-year period prior to the bankruptcy filing date; and (c) anticipated NARCO Trust payment values set forth in the then current draft of the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures.
The methodology required estimating, by disease, three critical inputs: (i) likely number of claims to be asserted against the NARCO Trust in the future, (ii) percentage of those claims likely to receive payment, and (iii) payment values.
The Company utilized outside asbestos liability valuation specialists to support our preparation of the NARCO Trust Liability estimate, which was based on a commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524(g) trusts.In 2002, when the Company first established its initial liability, NARCO asbestos claims resolution shifted from the tort system to an anticipated NARCO Trust framework, where claims would be processed in accordance with established NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures, including strict medical and exposure criteria for a plaintiff to receive compensation.
We believed at the time that the NARCO Trust’s claims filing and resolution experience after the NARCO Trust became operational would be significantly different from pre-bankruptcy tort system experience in light of these more rigorous claims processing requirements in the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures and Honeywell’s active oversight of claims processing and approval.
Given these anticipated differences, we believed that a 15-year time period was the appropriate horizon for establishing a probable and reasonably estimable liability for then unasserted NARCO claims as it represented our best estimate of the time period it would take for the NARCO Trust to be approved by the Bankruptcy Court, become fully operational and generate sufficiently reliable claims data (i.e., a data set which is statistically representative) to enable us to update our NARCO Trust Liability.The NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures were finalized in 2006, and the Company updated its NARCO Trust Liability to reflect the final terms and payment values.
The original 15-year period (from 2004 through 2018) for unasserted claims did not change as asbestos claims filings continued to be stayed against both Honeywell and NARCO.
The 2006 update resulted in a range of the estimated liability for unasserted claims of $743 million to $961 million, and we believed that no amount within this range was a better estimate than any other amount.
In accordance with ASC 450–Contingencies (“ASC 450”), we recorded the low end of the range of $743 million (the “2006 NARCO Trust Liability Estimate”) which resulted in a reduction of $207 million in our NARCO Trust Liability.NARCO emerged from bankruptcy on April 30, 2013, at which time a federally authorized 524(g) trust was established for the evaluation and resolution of all existing and future NARCO asbestos claims.
Both Honeywell and NARCO are protected by a permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal courts and requiring all asbestos related claims based on exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing products to be made against the NARCO Trust.The NARCO Trust Agreement and the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures are the principal documents setting forth the structure of the NARCO Trust.
These documents establish Honeywell’s evergreen funding obligations.
Honeywell is obligated to fund NARCO asbestos claims submitted to the NARCO Trust which qualify for payment under the Trust Distribution Procedures (Annual Contribution Claims), subject to an annual cap of $145 million.
However, the initial $100 million of claims processed through the NARCO Trust (the Initial Claims Amount) will not count against the annual cap and any unused portion of the Initial Claims Amount will roll over to subsequent years until fully utilized.
These documents also establish the material operating rules for the NARCO Trust, including Honeywell audit rights and the criteria claimants must meet to have a valid claim paid.
These claims payment criteria include providing the NARCO Trust with adequate medical evidence of the claimant’s asbestos-related condition and credible evidence of exposure to a specific NARCO asbestos-containing product.
Further, the NARCO Trust is eligible to receive cash dividends from Harbison-Walker International Inc (“HWI”), the reorganized and renamed entity that emerged, fully operational, from the NARCO bankruptcy.
The NARCO Trust is required to use any funding received from HWI to pay Annual Contribution Claims until those funds are exhausted.
It is only at this point that Honeywell’s funding obligation to the Trust is triggered.
Thus, there is an unrelated primary source for funding that affects Honeywell’s funding of the NARCO Trust Liability.73HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Once operational, the NARCO Trust began to receive, process and pay claims that had been previously stayed pending the Trust becoming operational.
As the NARCO Trust began to pay claims in 2014, we began to assert our on-going audit rights to review and monitor the claims processor’s adherence to the established requirements of the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures.
While doing so, we identified several issues with the way the Trust was implementing the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures.
In 2015, Honeywell filed suit against the NARCO Trust in Bankruptcy Court alleging breach of certain provisions of the NARCO Trust Agreement and NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures.
The parties agreed to dismiss the proceeding without prejudice pursuant to an 18-month Standstill Agreement, which expired in October 2017.
Notwithstanding its expiration, claims processing continues, and Honeywell continues to negotiate and attempt to resolve remaining disputed issues (that is, instances where Honeywell believes the NARCO Trust is not processing claims in accordance with established NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures).
Honeywell reserves the right to seek judicial intervention should negotiations fail.After the NARCO Trust became effective in 2013, the $743 million NARCO Trust Liability was then comprised of:(i) liability for unasserted claims; and(ii) liability for claims asserted after the NARCO Trust became operational but not yet paid.Although the Company knows the number of claims filed with the NARCO Trust each year, it is not able to determine at this time the portion of the NARCO Trust Liability which represents asserted versus unasserted claims due to the lack of sufficiently reliable claims data because of the claims processing issues described previously.Honeywell continues to maintain the 2006 NARCO Trust Liability (the $743 million accrual less payments made to the NARCO Trust for Annual Contribution Claims), as there has not been sufficiently reliable claims data history to enable the Company to update that liability.As of December 31, 2019, all cash dividends paid to the NARCO Trust by HWI has been used to pay Annual Contribution Claims.
In the fourth quarter of 2019, Honeywell funded $29 million to the NARCO Trust for the payment of Annual Contribution Claims.As of December 31, 2019, the Company's total NARCO asbestos liability of $858 million reflects Pre-bankruptcy NARCO liability of $144 million and NARCO Trust Liability of $714 million (the $743 million accrual for NARCO Trust Liability was reduced by the $29 million payment to the NARCO Trust in the fourth quarter of 2019 for Annual Contribution Claims).
Through December 31, 2019, Pre-bankruptcy NARCO Liability has been reduced by approximately $2 billion since first established in 2002, largely related to settlement payments.
The remaining Pre-bankruptcy NARCO liability principally represents estimated amounts owed pursuant to settlement agreements reached during the pendency of the NARCO bankruptcy proceedings that provide for the right to submit claims to the NARCO Trust subject to qualification under the terms of the settlement agreements and Trust Distribution Procedures.
The other NARCO bankruptcy obligations were paid in 2013 and no further liability is recorded.Honeywell continues to evaluate the appropriateness of the 2006 NARCO Trust Liability Estimate.
Despite becoming effective in 2013, the NARCO Trust has experienced delays in becoming fully operational.
Violations of the Trust Distribution Procedures and the resulting disputes and challenges, a standstill pending dispute resolution, and limited claims payments, have all contributed to the lack of sufficient normalized data based on actual claims processing experience in the Trust since it became operational.
As a result, we have not been able to further update the NARCO Trust Liability aside from deducting payments to the NARCO Trust for Annual Contribution Claims.
The 2006 million NARCO Trust Liability Estimate continues to be appropriate because of the unresolved pending claims in the Trust, some portion of which will result in payouts in the future, and because new claims continue to be filed with the NARCO Trust.
When sufficiently reliable claims data exists, we will update our estimate of the NARCO Trust Liability and it is possible that a material change may need to be recognized.The Company's insurance receivable of $281 million as of December 31, 2019, corresponding to the estimated liability for asserted and unasserted NARCO asbestos claims, reflects coverage which reimburses Honeywell for portions of NARCO-related indemnity and defense costs and is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market.
We conduct analyses to estimate the probable amount of insurance that is recoverable for asbestos claims.
While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries.
We made judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers.74HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Bendix Products—Bendix manufactured automotive brake linings that contained chrysotile asbestos in an encapsulated form.

We have valued Bendix asserted and unasserted claims using average resolution values for the previous five years.
We update the resolution values used to estimate the cost of Bendix asserted and unasserted claims during the fourth quarter each year.Honeywell reflects the inclusion of all years of epidemiological disease projection through 2059 when estimating the liability for unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims.
Such liability for unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims is based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years.Our insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of asserted and unasserted Bendix asbestos claims reflects coverage which is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market.
Based on our ongoing analysis of the probable insurance recovery, insurance receivables are recorded in the financial statements simultaneous with the recording of the estimated liability for the underlying asbestos claims.
This determination is based on our analysis of the underlying insurance policies, our historical experience with our insurers, our ongoing review of the solvency of our insurers, judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs, and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements reached with our insurers.In conjunction with the Garrett spin-off, the Company entered into an indemnification and reimbursement agreement with a Garrett subsidiary, pursuant to which Garrett’s subsidiary will have an obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell in amounts equal to (i) 90% of Honeywell’s asbestos-related liability payments primarily related to the Bendix business in the United States, as well as certain environmental-related liability payments and accounts payable and non-United States asbestos-related liability payments, in each case related to legacy elements of the Garrett business, including the legal costs of defending and resolving such liabilities, less (ii) 90% of Honeywell’s net insurance receipts and, as may be applicable, certain other recoveries associated with such liabilities.
The amount payable to Honeywell 75HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)in respect of such liabilities arising in any given year will be subject to a cap of approximately Euro 150 million (equivalent to $175 million at the time the indemnification and reimbursement agreement was entered into).
The obligation will continue until the earlier of December 31, 2048, or December 31 of the third consecutive year during which the annual obligation has been less than the Euro equivalent, at the fixed exchange rate at time of the indemnification and reimbursement agreement was entered into, of $25 million.
Reimbursements associated with this agreement were $152 million and $42 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and offset operating cash outflows incurred by the Company.
As the Company records the accruals for matters covered by the agreement, a corresponding receivable from Garrett is recorded for 90 percent of that accrual as determined by the terms of the agreement.
This receivable amount recorded in 2019 was $16 million.
In 2018, subsequent to the spin-off, the Company recorded a reversal to the receivable for $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.
As of December 31, 2019, Other Current Assets and Other Assets includes $115 million and $947 million representing the short-term and long-term portion of the receivable amount due from Garrett under the indemnification and reimbursement agreement.
As of December 31, 2018, Other Current Assets and Other Assets includes $171 million and $1,058 million representing the short-term and long-term portion of the receivable amount due from Garrett under the indemnification and reimbursement agreement.On December 2, 2019, Garrett Motion Inc. and Garrett ASASCO Inc. filed a Summons with Notice and commenced a lawsuit in the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York seeking to invalidate the indemnification and reimbursement agreement between Garrett and Honeywell.
Garrett seeks damages and a declaratory judgment based on various claims set forth in the Summons with Notice.
On January 15, 2020, Garrett filed its complaint in the action, which asserted the same claims.
We strongly believe that Garrett's allegations have no merit, nor are they material to Honeywell.
We believe we have fully complied with our obligations under the Agreement and that the Agreement is enforceable.On September 13, 2018, following completion of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Division of Corporation Finance’s review of our prior accounting for liabilities for unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims, the SEC Division of Enforcement advised that it had opened an investigation related to this matter.
On August 28, 2019, the SEC informed the Company that it had concluded its investigation and that it does not intend to recommend any enforcement action against Honeywell.
On October 31, 2018, David Kanefsky, a Honeywell shareholder, filed a putative class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 related to the prior accounting for Bendix asbestos claims.
On May 15, 2019, Wayne County Employees’ Retirement System, another Honeywell shareholder, filed a putative class action asserting the same claims relating to substantially the same alleged conduct in the same jurisdiction.
On December 16, 2019, the court denied Wayne County Employees' Retirement System's motion to be appointed as substitute lead plaintiff in the Kanefsky action.
On December 30, 2019, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint in the Kanefsky action.
We believe the claims related to the prior accounting for Bendix asbestos claims have no merit.Other MattersThe Company is subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters.
We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable.
We continually assess the likelihood of adverse judgments of outcomes in these matters, as well as potential ranges of possible losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts.
Included in these other matters are the following:Honeywell v. United Auto Workers (UAW) et.
al—In September 2011, the UAW and certain Honeywell retirees (Plaintiffs) filed a suit in the Eastern District of Michigan (the District Court) alleging that a series of Master Collective Bargaining Agreements (MCBAs) between Honeywell and the UAW provided the retirees with rights to lifetime, vested healthcare benefits that could never be changed or reduced.
Plaintiffs alleged that Honeywell had violated those vested rights by implementing express limitations (CAPS) on the amount Honeywell contributed toward healthcare coverage for the retirees.
Honeywell subsequently answered the UAW’s complaint and asserted counterclaims, including for breach of implied warranty.Between 2014 and 2015, Honeywell began enforcing the CAPS against former employees.
In response, the UAW and certain of the Plaintiffs filed a motion seeking a ruling that the MCBAs do not limit Honeywell’s obligation to contribute to healthcare coverage for those retirees.76HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)On March 29, 2018, the District Court issued its opinion resolving all pending summary judgment motions, except for Honeywell’s counterclaim for breach of implied warranty, which has since been dismissed without prejudice.In the opinion, the District Court held that the MCBAs do not promise retirees vested, lifetime benefits that survive expiration of the MCBAs.
Based on this ruling, Honeywell terminated the retirees healthcare coverage benefits altogether as of July 31, 2018.
In response, the UAW filed a motion to enjoin Honeywell from completely terminating coverage as of July 31, 2018, arguing that the CAPS themselves are vested and that Honeywell must continue to provide retiree medical benefits at the capped level.
On July 28, 2018, the District Court denied the UAW’s motion and entered a final judgment consistent with its March 2018 ruling.
The UAW has appealed this decision to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.
Honeywell believes the District Court’s ruling will be upheld.In the March 2018 opinion, the District Court also held that Honeywell is obligated under the MCBAs to pay the “full premium” for retiree healthcare rather than the capped amount.
Based on this ruling, Honeywell would be required to pay monetary damages to retirees for any past years in which Honeywell paid less than the “full premium” of their healthcare coverage.
Such damages would be limited, depending on the retiree group, to a two to three-year period ending when the 2017 MCBA expired, and Honeywell would have no ongoing obligation to continue funding healthcare coverage for subsequent periods.
Honeywell has appealed the District Court’s ruling on this “full premium” damages issue, and believes that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals will reverse the District Court on that issue.
In the event the Sixth Circuit were to sustain the District Court’s ruling on this issue, Honeywell would be liable for damages of at least $12 million.Petrobras and Unaoil—We are cooperating with certain investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the SEC and Brazilian authorities relating to our use of third parties who previously worked for our UOP business in Brazil in relation to Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras).
The investigations are focused on compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar Brazilian laws, and involve, among other things, document production and interviews with former and current management and employees.
The DOJ and the SEC are also examining a matter involving a foreign subsidiary’s prior engagement of Unaoil S.A.M.
in Algeria.
We are cooperating with the authorities in each of the above matters.
While we cannot predict the outcome of these matters, based on the facts currently known to us, we do not anticipate that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.In re Resideo Technologies, Inc. Securities Litigation—On January 7, 2020, The Gabelli Asset Fund and certain related parties filed a putative class action complaint against Resideo and Honeywell in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 related to Resideo's spinoff from Honeywell in October 2018.
On January 27, 2020, this putative class action was consolidated with certain previously-filed actions asserting claims relating to substantially the same matters into a single class action under the title In re Resideo Technologies, Inc. Securities Litigation.
We believe the allegations against Honeywell regarding the Resideo spinoff have no merit.Given the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations (including the specific matters referenced above), we do not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters (other than as specifically set forth above).
Considering our past experience and existing accruals, we do not expect the outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position.
Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid.77HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Warranties and GuaranteesIn the normal course of business, the Company issues product warranties and product performance guarantees.
We accrue for the estimated cost of product warranties and performance guarantees based on contract terms and historical experience at the time of sale.
Adjustments to initial obligations for warranties and guarantees are made as changes to the obligations become reasonably estimable.
The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded obligations for product warranties and product performance guarantees.

Pension and Other Postretirement BenefitsThe Company sponsors a number of both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans.
Pension benefits for many of our U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans.
All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywell’s U.S. defined benefit pension plans.
We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada.
Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate.The Company also sponsors postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees.
None of Honeywell’s U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company.
In addition, the vast majority of Honeywell’s U.S. retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount.
This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases.
The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded.
Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow.78HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)The following tables summarize the balance sheet impact, including the benefit obligations, assets and funded status associated with the Company's significant pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

 Discount rate(1)4.07% 3.39% 3.60%(1)Discount rate was 3.65% for 1/1/2017 through 2/28/2017.
Rate was changed to 3.60% for the remainder of 2017 due to a Plan remeasurement as of 3/1/2017.The discount rate for the Company's U.S. pension and other postretirement benefits plans reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be settled at the measurement date of December 31.
To determine discount rates for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we use a modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of our benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments.
We use the single weighted-average yield of this hypothetical portfolio as a discount rate benchmark.
We utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension benefit (income) for our significant pension plans.
This approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the pension benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and their corresponding spot rates.
For our U.S. pension plans, the single weighted average spot rates used to determine service and interest costs for 2020 are 3.33% and 2.76%.
The discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is lower principally due to a shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations.83HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)The Company plans to use an expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets of 6.15% for 2020 down from 6.75% for 2019 reflecting a decline in interest rates and additional re-balancing of assets to more fixed income.
Our asset return assumption is based on historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations with a focus on long-term trends rather than short-term market conditions.
We review the expected rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate.For non-U.S. benefit plans actuarial assumptions reflect economic and market factors relevant to each country.Pension BenefitsThe following amounts relate to the Company's significant pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets: December 31,U.S.

During 2019, we continued to employ a de-risking strategy which increases the matching characteristics of our assets relative to our obligation.
Our long-term target allocations are as follows: 55%-70% fixed income securities and cash, 25%-40% equity securities, 5%-10% real estate investments, and 10%-20% other types of investments.
Equity securities include publicly-traded stock of companies located both inside and outside the United States.
Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries.
Real estate investments include direct investments in commercial properties and investments in real estate funds.
Other types of investments include investments in private equity and hedge funds that follow several different strategies.
We review our assets on a regular basis to ensure that we are within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations.The Company's non-U.S. pension assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees with the Honeywell Corporate Investments group providing funding and investment guidance.
Our non-U.S. investment policies are different for each country as local regulations, funding requirements, and financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country.In accordance with ASU 2015-07, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)”, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our non-U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $479 million and $111 million.
In both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, the notional derivative exposure is related to outstanding equity and fixed income futures contracts.Common stocks, preferred stocks, real estate investment trusts, and short-term investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.
Corporate bonds, mortgages, asset-backed securities, and government securities are valued either by using pricing models, bids provided by brokers 87HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)or dealers, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and as such include adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks.
Certain securities are held in collective trust funds which are valued using net asset values provided by the administrators of the funds.
Investments in private equity, debt, real estate and hedge funds and direct private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner.
Investments in real estate properties are valued on a quarterly basis using the income approach.
Valuation estimates are periodically supplemented by third party appraisals.The Company's funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards.
In 2019, 2018, and 2017, we were not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans and no contributions were made.
We are not required to make any contributions to our U.S. pension plans in 2020.
In 2019, contributions of $43 million were made to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding requirements.
In 2020, we expect to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $112 million to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("generally accepted accounting principles").
Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.Basis for OpinionsThe Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks.
Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.93Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.
The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Asbestos Related Liabilities - North American Refractories Company (NARCO) Trust Liability - Refer to Note 20 to the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter DescriptionThe Company is named in asbestos related personal injury claims related to a predecessor company, NARCO.
Such claims arise primarily from alleged occupational exposure to asbestos-containing refractory brick and mortar for high-temperature applications.
Since becoming effective in 2013, the NARCO Trust has experienced delays in becoming fully operational.
Disputes and challenges regarding violations of the Trust Distribution Procedures, an expired 18-month standstill agreement and limited claims payments, have all contributed to a lack of sufficient normalized data based on actual claims processing experience in the NARCO Trust.Although the Company knows the number of claims filed with the NARCO Trust each year, it is not able at this time to determine the portion of the NARCO Trust Liability which represents asserted versus unasserted claims due to the lack of sufficiently reliable claims data.Maintaining the NARCO Trust Liability is inherently subjective as it requires management to make significant assumptions and judgements regarding the sufficiency and reliability of historical claims filing data and experience and expected future claims filing rates.
Given the subjectivity in maintaining the NARCO Trust Liability the auditing of the NARCO Trust Liability required a high degree of auditor judgment.How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the AuditOur audit procedures related to the NARCO Trust Liability included the following, among others: •We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the annual third-party assessment of the sufficiency and reliability of the NARCO Trust claims data including controls over the review of management’s assumptions and claims data used to estimate the NARCO Trust Liability.•We made inquiries of internal and external legal counsel regarding the regulatory and litigation environments related to the NARCO Trust Liability.
•With the assistance of our internal actuarial specialists, we evaluated NARCO Trust claims data to assess the reasonableness of management’s conclusion that such data is not sufficiently reliable to enable the Company to update the estimate of the recorded NARCO Trust Liability.
Revenue Recognition and Contracts with Customers - Long-Term Fixed Price Contracts (Performance Materials and Technologies (PMT)) - Refer to Note 1 and Note 7 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s PMT segment develops and manufactures advanced materials, process technologies, and automation solutions.
A portion of PMT’s revenue is generated from long-term fixed price contracts whereby revenue is recognized over the contract term (“over time”) as the work progresses and control of the goods and services is transferred to the customer.
Revenue for these contracts is recognized based on the extent of progress toward completion, generally measured by using a cost-to-cost basis input method.
94Accounting for PMT’s long-term fixed price contracts requires management’s judgment in estimating total contract costs.
Contract costs, which can be incurred over several years, are largely determined based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms and consider factors such as historical performance, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, and anticipated labor agreements.
Given the significant judgments necessary to estimate costs associated with these long-term contracts, auditing PMT’s long-term fixed price contracts requires a high degree of auditor judgment.How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the AuditOur audit procedures related to PMT’s long-term fixed price contracts included the following, among others: •We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the recognition of revenue and the determination of estimated contract costs including controls over the review of management’s assumptions and key inputs used to recognize revenue and costs on long-term fixed price contracts using the cost-to-cost input method.
•We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and assumptions used to recognize revenue and costs on long-term fixed price contracts using the cost-to-cost input method to recognize revenue over time.
•We selected a sample of long-term fixed price contracts and evaluated the estimates of total cost for each of the long-term fixed price contracts by: ▪Comparing costs incurred to date to the costs management estimated to be incurred to date.▪Evaluating management’s ability to achieve the estimates of total cost by performing corroborating inquiries with Company personnel, including project managers, and comparing the estimates to documentation such as management’s work plans, contract terms and requirements, and purchase orders with suppliers.
Our evaluation of management’s assumptions included consideration of historical and current project performance such as consistency of gross margin, identified risks related to project timing including technical and schedule matters, and the status of internal and third-party activities such as hardware, software, and labor.▪Performing a substantive analytical procedure, in which we compared the estimated costs to complete to an independent estimate of costs to complete that factored in information obtained from the corroborating inquiries and documentation obtained such as management’s work plans, contract terms and requirements, and purchase orders with suppliers./s/ Deloitte & Touche LLPCharlotte, North CarolinaFebruary 14, 2020 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2014.95Item 9.
Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial DisclosureNot Applicable.Item 9A.
Controls and ProceduresHoneywell management maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
There have been no changes that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting that have occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2019.Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) at December 31, 2019.
Based on these evaluations, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 were effective as of December 31, 2019.Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingHoneywell management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.Management assessed the effectiveness of Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019.
In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013).Based on this assessment, management determined that Honeywell maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019.The effectiveness of Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in
