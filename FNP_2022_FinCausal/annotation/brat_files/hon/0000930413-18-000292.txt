40 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Note 1.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting Principles—The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The following is a description of Honeywell’s significant accounting policies.
Principles of Consolidation—The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Honeywell International Inc. and all of its subsidiaries and entities in which a controlling interest is maintained.
Our consolidation policy requires equity investments that we exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee’s activities to be accounted for using the equity method.
Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which we do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.
All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.
Property, Plant and Equipment—Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including any asset retirement obligations, less accumulated depreciation.
For financial reporting, the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and 2 to 16 years for machinery and equipment.
Recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs.
Upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding asset’s useful life.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets—Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value.
We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2017 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date.
Other Intangible Assets with Determinable Lives—Other intangible assets with determinable lives consist of customer lists, technology, patents and trademarks and other intangibles and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 24 years.
Sales Recognition—Product and service sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance and engineering activities are recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered.
Sales under long-term contracts are recorded on a percentage-of-completion method measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts.
Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full when such losses become evident.
Revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements are recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element provided the delivered elements have value to customers on a standalone basis.
Amounts allocated to each element are based on its objectively determined fair value, such as the sales price for the product or service when it is sold separately or competitor prices for similar products or services.
Environmental—We accrue costs related to environmental matters when it is probable that we have incurred a liability related to a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
For additional information, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies.
Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries—We recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable.
In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable.
For additional information, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies.
41 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Aerospace Sales Incentives—We provide sales incentives to commercial aircraft manufacturers and airlines in connection with their selection of our aircraft equipment, predominately wheel and braking system hardware, avionics, and auxiliary power units, for installation on commercial aircraft.
These incentives consist of free or deeply discounted products, credits for future purchases of product and upfront cash payments.
These costs are recognized in the period incurred as cost of products sold or as a reduction to sales, as appropriate.
Research and Development—Research and development costs for company-sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred.
Such costs are principally included in cost of products sold and were $1,835 million, $1,864 million and $1,856 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015.
The 2016 research and development costs previously disclosed have been revised to reflect the amounts recorded in the 2016 Consolidated Statement of Operations and had no impact on the results of operations.
Stock-Based Compensation Plans—The principal awards issued under our stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 18 Stock-Based Compensation Plans, are non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units.
The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award.
The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award) and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant to recognize expense for those awards that are expected to vest and are based on our historical forfeiture rates.
Pension Benefits—We recognize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation (the corridor) annually in the fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment), and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered.
The remaining components of pension (income) expense, primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recognized on a quarterly basis (Pension ongoing (income) expense).
Foreign Currency Translation—Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than U.S.
Dollars are translated into U.S.
Dollars using year-end exchange rates.
Sales, costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year.
Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates.
Remeasurement adjustments for these subsidiaries are included in earnings.
Derivative Financial Instruments—We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risk and are not used for trading or other speculative purposes.
We do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments.
Derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract.
Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract.
All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value.
For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair values of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current earnings.
For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact earnings.
Cash flows of such derivative financial instruments are 42 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) classified consistent with the underlying hedged item.
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is reported as a component of Other comprehensive income (loss) and recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated.
Income Taxes—Significant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions.
We establish additional reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold.
The approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance which determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority.
In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities.
We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change in estimate become known.
Cash and cash equivalents—Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less.
Earnings Per Share—Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding.
Reclassifications—Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements—We consider the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).
ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows (consolidated financial statements).
In May 2014, and in following related amendments, the FASB issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that supersedes upon adoption previous revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
The underlying principle requires an entity to recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized.
Other major provisions include capitalization of certain contract costs, consideration of time value of money in the transaction price, and in certain circumstances, allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved.
The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers.
The Company has completed its evaluation of the new standard and has assessed the impacts of adoption on the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures.
Based on the evaluation of our current contracts and revenue streams, revenue recognition is mostly consistent under both the previous and new standard, with the exception of two key revenue streams within our Aerospace segment, which are described below.
First, the previous accounting policy for costs incurred for nonrecurring engineering and development activities of our Aerospace products with commercial customers was generally to record the expense as incurred.
Any customer funding received for such efforts was recognized when earned as a reduction of cost of sales.
Upon adoption of the new standard, the customer funding is generally classified as revenue and not as a reduction of cost of sales.
Such revenues are deferred and 43 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) subsequently recognized as products are delivered to the customers.
Additionally, under the new guidance, expenses incurred, up to the customer agreed funded amount, are deferred as an asset and subsequently recognized as cost of sales as products are delivered to the customer.
As a result of these changes, both deferred costs (assets) and deferred revenue (liability) increased by approximately $1,090 million effective January 1, 2018.
The aforementioned change in classification within the Consolidated Statement of Operations and timing difference in recognition is expected to have a minor impact on our gross margin percentage but no change to gross profit.
Second, the accounting for revenues for our mechanical service programs at our Aerospace segment are impacted.
Our previous policy was to recognize revenue over time as costs were incurred (input method).
Upon adoption, we continue to recognize revenue over time, but recognition is based on a series of distinct services using the output method.
At adoption, this change results in unbilled receivables and deferred revenue being eliminated through retained earnings.
We adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method.
The cumulative effect recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings of the above impacted revenue streams is $75 million.
The disclosures in our notes to Consolidated Financial Statements related to revenue recognition will be significantly expanded under the new standard, specifically around the quantitative and qualitative information about performance obligations, changes in contract assets and liabilities, and disaggregation of revenue.
In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for leases which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets for the rights and obligations created by those leases.
The guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases that will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.
We expect to adopt the requirements of the new standard effective January 1, 2019.
The guidance requires the use of a modified retrospective approach.
We are currently evaluating our lease portfolio to assess overall financial statement impact and planning for adoption and implementation of this standard.
We will continue to evaluate the adoption impact of this standard on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and related notes to financial statements.
In October 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, at the time the entity transfer occurs rather than when the asset is ultimately transferred to a third party, as required under current U.S. GAAP.
The guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice, particularly for transfers involving intellectual property.
Subsequent to 2017 fiscal year, we adopted the accounting standard update as of January 1, 2018.
The guidance requires application on a modified retrospective basis.
The adoption of this guidance increases our deferred tax assets by approximately $340 million with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings of the same amount.
In March 2017, the FASB issued guidance on presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost.
The new standard requires that an employer disaggregate the service cost component of net benefit cost.
The employer is required to report the service cost component in the same line item or items in the statement of operations as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period.
The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the statement of operations separately from the service cost component, such as in other income and expense.
The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.
Subsequent to 2017 fiscal year, we adopted the accounting standard update as of January 1, 2018.
This guidance impacts the presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our current presentation of the service cost component is consistent with the requirements of the new standard.
We will present the other components within Other (income) expense (we currently present the other components within Cost of products and services sold and 44 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Selling, general, and administrative expenses).
All components will continue to be excluded from Segment Profit (see Note 20 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits for components of net period benefit cost).
In August 2017, the FASB issued amendments to hedge accounting guidance.
These amendments are intended to better align a company’s risk management strategies and financial reporting for hedging relationships.
Under the new guidance, more hedging strategies will be eligible for hedge accounting and the application of hedge accounting is simplified.
In addition, the new guidance amends presentation and disclosure requirements.
The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted, including the interim periods within those years.
The guidance requires the use of a modified retrospective approach.
We are currently evaluating whether to early adopt the new guidance and the impact of this amendment on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and related notes to financial statements.
Note 2.
Acquisitions and Divestitures During 2017 there were no significant acquisitions individually or in aggregate.
During 2016, we acquired businesses for an aggregate cost (net of cash and debt assumed) of $2,538 million.

On October 1, 2016, the Company completed the tax-free spin-off of its Resins and Chemicals business, part of Performance Materials and Technologies, into a standalone, publicly-traded company (named AdvanSix Inc. (“AdvanSix”)) to Honeywell shareowners.
The assets and liabilities associated with AdvanSix have been removed from the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The results of operations for AdvanSix are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations through the effective date of the spin-off.
Honeywell shareowners of record as of the close of business on September 16, 2016 received one share of AdvanSix common stock for every 25 shares of Honeywell common stock.
Immediately prior to the effective date of the spin-off, AdvanSix incurred debt to make a cash distribution of $269 million to the Company.
At the same time, AdvanSix also incurred $38 million of borrowings in order to fund its post spin-off working capital.
In 2016 in connection with the spin-off, the Company entered into certain agreements with AdvanSix to effect our legal and structural separation including a transition services agreement with AdvanSix to provide certain administrative and other services for a limited time.
As of the end of 2017, most of those agreements have ended.
On September 16, 2016, the Company completed the sale of Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. for a sale price of $300 million.

The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives and with site transitions, in each of our segments, to more cost-effective locations.
The repositioning charge included asset impairments of $142 million principally in our Corporate segment related to the write-down of legacy properties and certain equipment in connection with their planned disposition and the write-down of a research and development facility in connection with a planned exit from such facility.
The repositioning charge included exit costs of $60 million principally for closure obligations associated with site transitions in each of our segments and for lease exit obligations in our Corporate segment.
In 2016, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $369 million including severance costs of $283 million related to workforce reductions of 6,585 manufacturing and administrative positions across our segments.
The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives; the separation of the 47 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) former Automation and Control Solutions reporting segment into two new reporting segments; site transitions in each of our segments to more cost-effective locations; and achieving acquisition-related synergies.
The repositioning charge included asset impairments of $43 million principally related to the write-off of certain intangible assets in connection with the sale of a Performance Materials and Technologies business.
The repositioning charge included exit costs of $43 million principally for expenses related to the spin-off of our AdvanSix business and closure obligations associated with site transitions.
Also, $109 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, were returned to income as a result of higher attrition than anticipated in prior severance programs resulting in lower required severance payments, lower than expected severance costs in certain repositioning actions, and changes in scope of previously announced repositioning actions.
In 2015, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $216 million including severance costs of $197 million related to workforce reductions of 6,405 manufacturing and administrative positions across our segments.
The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives.
Also, $53 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, were returned to income due principally to higher attrition than anticipated in prior severance programs resulting in lower required severance payments, and changes in scope of previously announced repositioning actions.

The increase was primarily attributable to the provisional impact of U.S. tax reform (see “The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” further below), partially offset by increased tax benefits from foreign tax credits and for employee share-based payments.
The Company’s non-U.S. effective tax rate was 71.4%, an increase of approximately 54.7 percentage points compared to 2016.
The year-over-year increase in the non-U.S. effective tax rate was primarily driven by the Company’s change in assertion regarding foreign unremitted earnings, increased expense for reserves in various jurisdictions and increased withholding taxes, partially offset by higher earnings in low tax rate jurisdictions.
The effective tax rate decreased by 1.6 percentage points in 2016 compared to 2015.
The decrease was primarily attributable to excess tax benefits from employee share-based payments arising from adoption of the FASB’s amended guidance related to employee share-based payment accounting, partially offset by increased tax reserves in various jurisdictions and lower tax benefits from manufacturing incentives.
The Company’s non-U.S effective tax rate was 16.7%, a decrease of approximately 2.8 percentage points compared to 2015.
The year-over-year decrease in the non-U.S. effective tax rate was primarily driven by higher earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions and a decrease in the tax impact of restructuring and divestitures.
The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to overall non-U.S. earnings taxed at lower rates.

Our gross deferred tax assets include $794 million related to non-U.S. operations comprised principally of net operating losses, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards (mainly in Canada, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom) and deductible temporary differences.
We maintain a valuation allowance of $660 million against a portion of the non-U.S. gross deferred tax assets.
The change in the valuation allowance resulted in increases of $4 million, $69 million and $114 million to income tax expense in 2017, 2016 and 2015.
In the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, we will reduce such amounts through an increase to income tax expense in the period such determination is made.
Conversely, if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a reduction to income tax expense in the period that such determination is made.
51 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) As of December 31, 2017, our net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards were as follows: Jurisdiction ExpirationPeriod Net Operatingand Capital LossCarryforwards Tax CreditCarryforwards U.S. Federal 2037 $ 16 $ 332 U.S. State 2037 508 24 Non-U.S. 2037 607 159 Non-U.S.

The following table summarizes tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions as of December 31, 2017: Jurisdiction Open Tax YearsBased on Originally Filed Returns Examination inprogress Examination not yetinitiated U.S. Federal 2013 – 2016 2015 – 2017 U.S. State 2011 – 2016 2012 – 2017 Australia N/A 2016 – 2017 Canada(1) 2012 – 2014, 2016 2015 – 2017 China 2003 – 2017 N/A France 2012 – 2017 2006 – 2011 Germany(1) 2008 – 2015 2016 – 2017 India 1999 – 2015 2016 – 2017 Switzerland(1) 2012 – 2016 2017 United Kingdom 2013 – 2015 2016 – 2017 (1) Includes provincial or similar local jurisdictions, as applicable.
Based on the outcome of these examinations, or as a result of the expiration of statute of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns will materially change from those recorded as liabilities in our financial statements.
In addition, the outcome of these examinations may impact the valuation of certain deferred tax assets (such as net operating losses) in future periods.
52 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Unrecognized tax benefits for examinations in progress were $487 million, $398 million and $349 million, as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
Estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes are classified as a component of Tax expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and totaled $28 million, $18 million and $11 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
Accrued interest and penalties were $423 million, $395 million and $336 million, as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) that instituted fundamental changes to the taxation of multinational corporations.
The Tax Act includes changes to the taxation of foreign earnings by implementing a dividend exemption system, expansion of the current anti-deferral rules, a minimum tax on low-taxed foreign earnings and new measures to deter base erosion.
The Tax Act also includes a permanent reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21%, repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, expensing of capital investment, and limitation of the deduction for interest expense.
Furthermore, as part of the transition to the new tax system, a one-time transition tax is imposed on a U.S. shareholder’s historical undistributed earnings of foreign affiliates.
Although the Tax Act is generally effective January 1, 2018, GAAP requires recognition of the tax effects of new legislation during the reporting period that includes the enactment date, which was December 22, 2017.
As a result of the impacts of the Tax Act, the SEC provided guidance that allows the Company to record provisional amounts for those impacts, with the requirement that the accounting be completed in a period not to exceed one year from the date of enactment.
As of December 31, 2017, the Company has not completed the accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act.
Therefore, we have recorded provisional amounts for the effects of the Tax Act.
The primary impacts of the Tax Act relate to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the change in the corporate tax rate (“Corporate Tax Rate Change”); the one-time mandatory transition tax on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliates (“Mandatory Transition Tax”); and deferred taxes in connection with a change in the Company’s intent to permanently reinvest the historical undistributed earnings of its foreign affiliates (“Undistributed Foreign Earnings”).
Corporate Tax Rate Change—For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $235 million due to the decrease in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.
At the date of enactment, the Company had a deferred tax liability for the excess of its net book value over its tax basis of its U.S. assets and liabilities that will generate future taxable income in excess of book income.
Due to the Tax Act, this additional taxable income will be subject to tax at a lower corporate tax rate, consequently reducing the Company’s deferred tax liability as of the date of enactment.
Mandatory Transition Tax—For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a provisional tax charge of approximately $1.9 billion due to the imposition of the mandatory transition tax (“MTT”) on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings.
The Tax Act imposes a one-time tax on undistributed and previously untaxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits (E&P), as determined in accordance with U.S. tax principles, of certain foreign corporations owned by U.S. shareholders.
In general, we have estimated $20 billion of E&P related to our foreign affiliates that is subject to the MTT.
The MTT is imposed at a rate of 15.5% to the extent of the cash and cash equivalents that are held by the foreign affiliates at certain testing dates; the remaining E&P is taxed at a rate of 8.0%.
In accordance with the Tax Act, the Company will elect to pay the MTT liability over a period of eight years, with the first installment of $144 million due in 2018; the remainder of the balance is recorded in Other liabilities (noncurrent).
As of December 31, 2017, the Company has recorded a provisional amount because certain information related to the computation of E&P is not readily available, some of the testing dates to determine taxable amounts have not yet occurred, and there is limited information from federal and state taxing authorities regarding the 53 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) application and interpretation of the recently enacted legislation.
The Company will disclose the impact to the provisional amount in the reporting period in which the accounting is completed, which will not exceed one year from the date of enactment of the Tax Act.
Undistributed Foreign Earnings—For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a provisional tax charge of approximately $2.1 billion due to the Company’s intent to no longer permanently reinvest the historical undistributed earnings of its foreign affiliates.
We previously considered substantially all of the earnings in our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested and, accordingly, recorded no deferred income taxes on such earnings.
As a result of the fundamental changes to the taxation of multinational corporations created by the Tax Act, the Company no longer intends to permanently reinvest the historical undistributed earnings of its foreign affiliates, which amounted to approximately $20 billion as of December 31, 2017 (including current year earnings).
GAAP requires recognition of a deferred tax liability in the reporting period in which its intent to no longer permanently reinvest its historical undistributed foreign earnings is made.
Although no U.S. federal taxes will be imposed on such future distributions of foreign earnings, in many cases the cash transfer will be subject to foreign withholding and other local taxes.
Accordingly, at December 31, 2017 the Company has included a provisional deferred tax liability, mostly related to non-U.S. withholding taxes.
The Company has recorded a provisional amount because certain information related to the computation of E&P, distributable reserves and foreign exchange gains and losses is not readily available.
The Company will disclose the impact to the provisional amount in the reporting period in which the accounting is completed, which will not exceed one year from the date of enactment of the Tax Act.
The provisional amount is based on the Company’s current legal ownership structure which may change in the future.
Any future tax impacts resulting from changes to the legal ownership structure will not be considered changes to the provisional amount and will be recorded in the reporting period in which a plan to modify the legal structure is adopted, which may exceed one year from the date of enactment of the Tax Act.
Global Intangible Low Taxed Income—In addition to the changes described above, the Tax Act imposes a U.S. tax on global intangible low taxed income (“GILTI”) that is earned by certain foreign affiliates owned by a U.S. shareholder.
The computation of GILTI is still subject to interpretation and additional clarifying guidance is expected, but is generally intended to impose tax on the earnings of a foreign corporation that are deemed to exceed a certain threshold return relative to the underlying business investment.
In accordance with guidance issued by FASB, the Company has made a policy election to treat future taxes related to GILTI as a current period expense in the reporting period in which the tax is incurred.

Note 14.
Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures Credit and Market Risk—Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest and currency exchange rates.
We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk.
Our counterparties in derivative transactions are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments.
We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities.
We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business.
The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer.
Our sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers.
Foreign Currency Risk Management—We conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies.
Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and transactions arising from international trade.
Our primary objective is to preserve the U.S. Dollar value of foreign currency denominated cash flows and earnings.
We attempt to hedge currency exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible 59 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts (foreign currency exchange contracts) with third parties.
We hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
Prior to conversion into U.S. dollars, these assets and liabilities are remeasured at spot exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date.
The effects of changes in spot rates are recognized in earnings and included in other (income) expense.
We partially hedge forecasted sales and purchases, which occur in the next twelve months and are denominated in non-functional currencies, with foreign currency exchange contracts.
Changes in the forecasted non-functional currency cash flows due to movements in exchange rates are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the foreign currency exchange contracts designated as hedges.
Market value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized.
Open foreign currency exchange contracts mature in the next twelve months.
At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had contracts with notional amounts of $9,273 million and $9,554 million to exchange foreign currencies, principally the U.S. Dollar, Euro, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Renminbi, Indian Rupee, Mexican Peso, and Singapore Dollar.
We have also designated foreign currency debt and certain derivative contracts as hedges against portions of our net investment in foreign operations during the year ended December 31, 2017.
Gains or losses on the effective portion of the foreign currency debt designated as a net investment hedge are recorded in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments.
The Company did not have ineffectiveness related to net investment hedges during the year ended December 31, 2017.
Interest Rate Risk Management—We use a combination of financial instruments, including long-term, medium-term and short-term financing, variable-rate commercial paper, and interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing.
At December 31, 2017 and 2016, interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges effectively changed $2,600 million and $1,850 million of fixed rate debt at rates of 2.93% and 3.39% to LIBOR based floating rate debt.
Our interest rate swaps mature at various dates through 2026.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments—The FASB’s accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
Financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2017 and 2016: December 31, 2017 2016 Assets: Foreign currency exchange contracts $ 17 $ 152 Available for sale investments 3,916 1,670 Interest rate swap agreements 44 69 Liabilities: Foreign currency exchange contracts $ 70 $ 2 Interest rate swap agreements 52 48 The foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements are valued using broker quotations, or market transactions in either the listed or over-the-counter markets.
As such, these derivative instruments are classified within level 2.
The Company also holds investments in commercial paper, certificates of deposits, and time deposits that are designated as available for sale and are valued using published prices based off observable market data.
As such, these investments are classified within level 2.
The Company also holds available for sale investments in U.S. 60 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) government and corporate debt securities valued utilizing published prices based on quoted market pricing, which are classified within level 1.
The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts and notes receivables, payables, commercial paper and short-term borrowings contained in the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximates fair value.
The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that were not carried at fair value: December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 CarryingValue FairValue CarryingValue FairValue Assets Long-term receivables $ 296 $ 289 $ 280 $ 273 Liabilities Long-term debt and related current maturities $ 13,924 $ 14,695 $ 12,409 $ 13,008 The Company determined the fair value of the long-term receivables by discounting based upon the terms of the receivable and counterparty details including credit quality.
As such, the fair value of these receivables is considered level 2.
The Company determined the fair value of the long-term debt and related current maturities utilizing transactions in the listed markets for identical or similar liabilities.
As such, the fair value of the long-term debt and related current maturities is considered level 2 as well.
Interest rate swap agreements are designated as hedge relationships with gains or losses on the derivative recognized in interest and other financial charges offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying debt being hedged.
Losses on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $29 million and $71 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and were $2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015.
Gains and losses are fully offset by losses and gains on the underlying debt being hedged.
We also economically hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally with forward contracts.
These contracts are marked-to-market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings offsetting the gains and losses on the non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being hedged.
We recognized $207 million of expense and $232 million of income in Other (income) expense in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
We recognized $86 million of expense in Other (income) expense in the year ended December 31, 2015.
See Note 4 Other (Income) Expense for further details of the net impact of these economic foreign currency hedges.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans The 2016 Stock Incentive Plan of Honeywell International Inc. and its Affiliates (2016 Plan) and 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc (2016 Directors Plan) were both approved by the shareowners at the Annual Meeting of Shareowners effective on April 25, 2016.
Following approval of both plans, we have not and will not grant any new awards under any previously existing stock-based compensation plans.
At December 31, 2017, there were 42,025,990, and 924,694 shares of Honeywell common stock available for future grants under terms of the 2016 Plan and 2016 Directors Plan, respectively.
Stock Options—The exercise price, term and other conditions applicable to each option granted under our stock plans are generally determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board.
The exercise price of stock options is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share of our stock on that date.
The fair value is recognized as an expense over the employee’s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award).
Options generally vest over a four-year period and expire after ten years.
The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock and historical volatility of our common stock.
We used a Monte Carlo simulation model to derive an expected term which represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding.
Such model uses historical data to estimate option exercise activity and post-vest termination behavior.
The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment.
We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations.
However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances.
Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future.
With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we continually conduct studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques.
It is our policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work.
The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts 67 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available.
Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities.
We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow.
The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of remedial investigations and feasibility studies, the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties.
The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded liabilities for environmental costs: Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Beginning of year $ 511 $ 518 $ 591 Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable 287 195 194 Environmental liability payments (212 ) (228 ) (273 ) Other 9 26 6 End of year $ 595 $ 511 $ 518 Environmental liabilities are included in the following balance sheet accounts: December 31, 2017 2016 Accrued liabilities $ 226 $ 252 Other liabilities 369 259 $ 595 $ 511 We do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of environmental liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined although they could be material to our consolidated results of operations and operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid.
However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position.
Onondaga Lake, Syracuse, NY—In 2016, we largely completed a dredging/capping remedy of Onondaga Lake pursuant to a consent decree approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York in January 2007.
Some additional long-term monitoring and maintenance activities will continue, as required by the consent decree.
Honeywell is also conducting remedial investigations and activities at other sites in Syracuse.
We have recorded reserves for these investigations and activities where appropriate, consistent with the accounting policy described above.
Honeywell and the federal and New York State natural resource trustees have submitted a consent decree to the federal court requesting approval for a negotiated settlement of natural resource damages claims for this site.
68 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Asbestos Matters Honeywell is a defendant in asbestos related personal injury actions related to two predecessor companies: • North American Refractories Company (“NARCO”), which was sold in 1986, produced refractory products (bricks and cement used in high temperature applications).
Claimants consist largely of individuals who allege exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing refractory products in an occupational setting.
• Bendix Friction Materials (“Bendix”) business, which was sold in 2014, manufactured automotive brake parts that contained chrysotile asbestos in an encapsulated form.
Claimants consist largely of individuals who allege exposure to asbestos from brakes from either performing or being in the vicinity of individuals who performed brake replacements.

Both Honeywell and NARCO are protected by a permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal courts and requiring all asbestos related claims based on exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing products to be made against the NARCO Trust.
The NARCO Trust reviews submitted claims and determines award amounts in accordance with established Trust Distribution Procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court which set forth the criteria claimants must meet to qualify for compensation including, among other things, exposure and medical criteria that determine the award amount.
In addition, Honeywell provided, and continues to provide, input to the design of control procedures for processing NARCO claims, and has on-going audit rights to review and monitor the claims processor’s adherence to the established requirements of the Trust Distribution Procedures.
Honeywell is obligated to fund NARCO asbestos claims submitted to the NARCO Trust which qualify for payment under the Trust Distribution Procedures (Annual Contribution Claims), subject to annual caps of $140 million in 2018 and $145 million for each year thereafter.
However, the initial $100 million of claims processed through the NARCO Trust (the Initial Claims Amount) will not count against the annual cap and any unused portion of the Initial Claims Amount will roll over to subsequent years until fully utilized.
In 2015, Honeywell filed suit against the NARCO Trust in Bankruptcy Court alleging breach of certain provisions of the Trust Agreement and Trust Distribution Procedures.
The parties agreed to dismiss the proceeding without prejudice pursuant to an 18 month Standstill Agreement.
Claims processing continued during this period as the parties attempted to resolve disputed issues.
The Standstill Agreement expired on October 12, 2017.
Notwithstanding its expiration, claims processing continues, and Honeywell continues to negotiate and attempt to resolve remaining disputed issues (that is, instances where Honeywell believes the Trust is not processing claims in accordance with established Trust Distribution Procedures).
Honeywell reserves its right to seek judicial intervention should negotiations fail or prove futile.
As of December 31, 2017, Honeywell has not made any payments to the NARCO Trust for Annual Contribution Claims.
Honeywell is also responsible for payments due to claimants pursuant to settlement agreements reached during the pendency of the NARCO bankruptcy proceedings that provide for the right to submit claims to the NARCO Trust subject to qualification under the terms of the settlement agreements and Trust Distribution Procedures criteria (Pre-established Unliquidated Claims), which amounts are estimated at $150 million and are expected to be paid during the initial years of trust operations ($5 million of which has been paid since the effective date of the NARCO Trust).
Such payments are not subject to the annual cap described above.
Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for Pre-established Unliquidated Claims ($145 million), as well as unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection and operating and legal costs related to the Trust (collectively $19 million) and for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust 70 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) ($743 million).
The estimate of future NARCO claims was prepared in 2002, in the same year NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection, using NARCO tort system litigation experience based on a commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524(g) trusts.
Accordingly, the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos claims was prepared before there was data on claims filings and payment rates in the NARCO Trust under the Trust Distribution Procedures and also prepared when the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims was in effect (which remained in effect until NARCO emerged from Bankruptcy protection).
Some critical assumptions underlying this commonly accepted methodology included claims filing rates, disease criteria and payment values contained in the Trust Distribution Procedures, estimated approval rates of claims submitted to the NARCO Trust and epidemiological studies estimating disease instances.
The estimated value of the future NARCO liability reflects claims expected to be asserted against NARCO over a fifteen year period.
This projection resulted in a range of estimated liability of $743 million to $961 million.
We believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount and accordingly, we have recorded the minimum amount in the range.
Given the Trust’s lack of sufficient claims processing experience since NARCO emerged from bankruptcy protection, it is not yet possible to reliably estimate future claim costs based on actual Trust experience.
Our insurance receivable corresponding to the estimated liability for pending and future NARCO asbestos claims reflects coverage which reimburses Honeywell for portions of NARCO-related indemnity and defense costs and is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market.
We conduct analyses to estimate the probable amount of insurance that is recoverable for asbestos claims.
While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries.
We made judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers.
Projecting future events is subject to many uncertainties that could cause the NARCO-related asbestos liabilities or assets to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded.
Given the uncertainties, we review our estimates periodically, and update them based on our experience and other relevant factors.
Similarly, we will reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability or other developments that may impact insurance recoveries.
Bendix Products—The following tables present information regarding Bendix related asbestos claims activity: Claims Activity Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Claims Unresolved at the beginning of year 7,724 7,779 Claims Filed 2,645 2,830 Claims Resolved (4,089 ) (2,885 ) Claims Unresolved at the end of year 6,280 7,724 Disease Distribution of Unresolved Claims December 31, 2017 2016 Mesothelioma and Other Cancer Claims 3,062 3,490 Nonmalignant Claims 3,218 4,234 Total Claims 6,280 7,724 71 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Honeywell has experienced average resolution values per claim excluding legal costs as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 (in whole dollars) Malignant claims $ 56,000 $ 44,000 $ 44,000 $ 53,500 $ 51,000 Nonmalignant claims $ 2,800 $ 4,485 $ 100 $ 120 $ 850 It is not possible to predict whether resolution values for Bendix-related asbestos claims will increase, decrease or stabilize in the future.
Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for resolution of pending (claims actually filed as of the financial statement date) and future Bendix-related asbestos claims.
We have valued Bendix pending and future claims using average resolution values for the previous five years.
We update the resolution values used to estimate the cost of Bendix pending and future claims during the fourth quarter each year.
The liability for future claims represents the estimated value of future asbestos related bodily injury claims expected to be asserted against Bendix over the next five years.
Such estimated cost of future Bendix-related asbestos claims is based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years.
In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years.
The methodology used to estimate the liability for future claims is similar to that used to estimate the liability for future NARCO-related asbestos claims.
Our insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of pending and future Bendix asbestos claims reflects coverage which is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market.
Based on our ongoing analysis of the probable insurance recovery, insurance receivables are recorded in the financial statements simultaneous with the recording of the estimated liability for the underlying asbestos claims.
This determination is based on our analysis of the underlying insurance policies, our historical experience with our insurers, our ongoing review of the solvency of our insurers, judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs, and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements reached with our insurers.
Honeywell believes it has sufficient insurance coverage and reserves to cover all pending Bendix-related asbestos claims and Bendix-related asbestos claims estimated to be filed within the next five years.
Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of either pending or future Bendix-related asbestos claims, we do not believe that such claims would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position in light of our insurance coverage and our prior experience in resolving such claims.
If the rate and types of claims filed, the average resolution value of such claims and the period of time over which claim settlements are paid (collectively, the Variable Claims Factors) do not substantially change, Honeywell would not expect future Bendix-related asbestos claims to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in any fiscal year.
No assurances can be given, however, that the Variable Claims Factors will not change.
Other Matters We are subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters.
We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable.
We continually assess the likelihood of adverse judgments of outcomes in these matters, as well as 72 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) potential ranges of possible losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts.
Included in these other matters are the following: Honeywell v. United Auto Workers (UAW) et.
al—In September 2011, the UAW and certain Honeywell retirees filed a suit in the Eastern District of Michigan alleging that the Master Collective Bargaining Agreements (MCBAs) between Honeywell and the UAW do not provide for limitations on Honeywell’s obligation to contribute toward healthcare coverage for former employees who retired under the MCBAs (“CAPS”).
Honeywell subsequently answered the UAW’s complaint and asserted counterclaims.
Honeywell began enforcing the CAPS against former employees who retired after the initial inclusion of the CAPS in the 2003 MCBA (the post-2003 retirees) on January 1, 2014.
The UAW and certain of the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment with respect to the post-2003 retirees, seeking a ruling that the 2003 MCBA did not limit Honeywell’s obligation to contribute to healthcare coverage for those retirees.
That motion remains pending.
Honeywell is confident that the District Court will find that the 2003 MCBA does, in fact, limit Honeywell’s retiree healthcare obligation for the post-2003 retirees.
In the event of an adverse ruling, however, Honeywell’s other postretirement benefits for post-2003 retirees would increase by approximately $79 million, reflecting the estimated value of these CAPS.
In the second quarter of 2014, the parties agreed to stay the proceedings with respect to former employees who retired before the initial inclusion of the CAPS in the 2003 MCBA (the pre-2003 retirees) until the Supreme Court decided M&G Polymers USA, LLC v. Tackett.
The Supreme Court decided the case on January 26, 2015 and, based on the ruling, Honeywell began enforcing the CAPS against the pre-2003 retirees on May 1, 2015.
Honeywell is confident that the CAPS will be upheld by the District Court and that its liability for healthcare coverage premiums with respect to the putative class will be limited as negotiated and expressly set forth in the applicable MCBAs.
In the event of an adverse ruling, however, Honeywell’s other postretirement benefits for pre-2003 retirees would increase by approximately $103 million, reflecting the estimated value of these CAPS.
Given the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations (including the specific matter referenced above), we do not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters (other than as specifically set forth above).
Considering our past experience and existing accruals, we do not expect the outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position.
Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid.
Warranties and Guarantees In the normal course of business we issue product warranties and product performance guarantees.
We accrue for the estimated cost of product warranties and performance guarantees based on contract terms and historical experience at the time of sale.
Adjustments to initial obligations for warranties and guarantees are made as changes to the obligations become reasonably estimable.
73 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded obligations for product warranties and product performance guarantees.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor a number of both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans.
Pension benefits for many of our U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans.
All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywell’s U.S. defined benefit pension plans.
We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada.
Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate.
We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees.
None of Honeywell’s U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company.
In addition, the vast majority of Honeywell’s U.S. retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount.
This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases.
The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded.
Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow.

Rate was changed to 3.60% for the remainder of 2017 due to Plan remeasurement as of 3/1/17.
The discount rate for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefits plans reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be settled at the measurement date of December 31.
To determine discount rates for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we use a modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of our benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments.
We use the single 78 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) weighted-average yield of this hypothetical portfolio as a discount rate benchmark.
The discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is lower principally due to a shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations.
During the fourth quarter of 2015 we changed the methodology used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit (income) cost for our significant pension plans.
Previously, we estimated such cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the pension benefit obligation.
The new methodology utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these cost components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the pension benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and their corresponding spot rates.
The change did not affect the measurement of our pension obligation and was applied prospectively as a change in estimate.
For our U.S. pension plans, the single weighted average spot rates used to determine service and interest costs for 2018 are 3.77% and 3.27%.
Our expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets of 7.75% is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations.
We review the expected rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate.
For non-U.S. benefit plans actuarial assumptions reflect economic and market factors relevant to each country.
Pension Benefits The following amounts relate to our significant pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets.
December 31, U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans 2017 2016 2017 2016 Projected benefit obligation $ 371 $ 17,414 $ 1,082 $ 2,294 Accumulated benefit obligation $ 360 $ 17,263 $ 1,018 $ 2,220 Fair value of plan assets — $ 16,814 $ 269 $ 1,552 Accumulated benefit obligation for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $18.1 billion and $17.3 billion and for our Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $6.9 billion and $6.4 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016.
Our asset investment strategy for our U.S. pension plans focuses on maintaining a diversified portfolio using various asset classes in order to achieve our long-term investment objectives on a risk adjusted basis.
Our actual invested positions in various securities change over time based on short and longer-term investment opportunities.
To achieve our objectives, we have established long-term target allocations as follows: 60%-70% equity securities, 10%-20% fixed income securities and cash, 5%-15% real estate investments, and 10%-20% other types of investments.
Equity securities include publicly-traded stock of companies located both inside and outside the United States.
Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries.
Real estate investments include direct investments in commercial properties and investments in real estate funds.
Other types of investments include investments in private equity and hedge funds that follow several different strategies.
We review our assets on a regular basis to ensure that we are within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations.
Our non-U.S. pension assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees with the Honeywell Corporate Investments group providing funding and investment guidance.
Our non-U.S. 79 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) investment policies are different for each country as local regulations, funding requirements, and financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country.
In accordance with ASU 2015-07, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)”, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value amounts presented in the following tables are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented for the total pension benefits plan assets.
The fair values of both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans assets by asset category are as follows: U.S. Plans December 31, 2017 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Equities: Honeywell common stock $ 2,832 $ 2,832 $ — $ — U.S. equities 3,573 3,573 — — Non-U.S. equities 2,631 2,618 13 — Real estate investment trusts 265 265 — — Fixed income: Short term investments 919 919 — — Government securities 428 — 428 — Corporate bonds 5,052 — 5,052 — Mortgage/Asset-backed securities 742 — 742 — Insurance contracts 8 — 8 — Direct investments: Direct private investments 752 — — 752 Real estate properties 597 — — 597 Total 17,799 $ 10,207 $ 6,243 $ 1,349 Investments measured at NAV: Private funds 901 Real estate funds 84 Hedge funds 20 Commingled Funds 181 Total assets at fair value $ 18,985 80 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) U.S. Plans December 31, 2016 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Equities: Honeywell common stock $ 2,140 $ 2,140 $ — $ — U.S. equities 3,583 3,583 — — Non-U.S. equities 2,069 2,037 32 — Real estate investment trusts 203 203 — — Fixed income: Short term investments 1,306 1,306 — — Government securities 305 — 305 — Corporate bonds 4,366 — 4,366 — Mortgage/Asset-backed securities 617 — 617 — Insurance contracts 7 — 7 — Direct investments: Direct private investments 609 — — 609 Real estate properties 664 — — 664 Total 15,869 $ 9,269 $ 5,327 $ 1,273 Investments measured at NAV: Private funds 815 Real estate funds 110 Hedge funds 20 Total assets at fair value $ 16,814 Non-U.S. Plans December 31, 2017 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Equities: U.S. equities $ 573 $ 420 $ 153 $ — Non-U.S. equities 2,801 99 2,702 — Fixed income: Short-term investments 238 238 — — Government securities 1,685 — 1,685 — Corporate bonds 1,364 — 1,364 — Mortgage/Asset-backed securities 47 — 47 — Insurance contracts 157 — 157 — Investments in private funds: Private funds 52 — 21 31 Real estate funds 149 — — 149 Total 7,066 $ 757 $ 6,129 $ 180 Investments measured at NAV: Private funds 29 Real estate funds 56 Total assets at fair value $ 7,151 81 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Non-U.S. Plans December 31, 2016 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Equities: U.S. equities $ 650 $ 525 $ 125 $ — Non-U.S. equities 2,153 219 1,934 — Fixed income: Short-term investments 146 146 — — Government securities 1,530 — 1,530 — Corporate bonds 1,220 — 1,220 — Mortgage/Asset-backed securities 18 — 18 — Insurance contracts 152 — 152 — Investments in private funds: Private funds 42 — 19 23 Real estate funds 124 — — 124 Total 6,035 $ 890 $ 4,998 $ 147 Investments measured at NAV: Private funds 33 Real estate funds 52 Total assets at fair value $ 6,120 The following table summarizes changes in the fair value of Level 3 assets for both U.S. and Non-U.S. plans: U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans DirectPrivateInvestments Real EstateProperties PrivateFunds Real EstateFunds Balance at December 31, 2015 $ 535 $ 626 $ 10 $ 152 Actual return on plan assets: Relating to assets still held at year-end (42 ) 11 1 (22 ) Relating to assets sold during the year 28 7 — (1 ) Purchases 141 48 12 — Sales and settlements (53 ) (28 ) — (5 ) Balance at December 31, 2016 609 664 23 124 Actual return on plan assets: Relating to assets still held at year-end 33 2 5 26 Relating to assets sold during the year 51 31 — — Purchases 148 18 6 — Sales and settlements (89 ) (118 ) (3 ) (1 ) Balance at December 31, 2017 $ 752 $ 597 $ 31 $ 149 The Company enters into futures contracts to gain exposure to certain markets.
Sufficient cash or cash equivalents are held by our pension plans to cover the notional value of the futures contracts.
At December 31, 2017 and 2016, our U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $4,188 million and $3,775 million.
At December 31, 2017 and 2016, our non-U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $133 million and $55 million.
In both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, the notional derivative exposure is primarily related to outstanding equity futures contracts.
Common stocks, preferred stocks, real estate investment trusts, and short-term investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.
Corporate bonds, mortgages, asset-backed securities, and government securities are valued either by 82 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) using pricing models, bids provided by brokers or dealers, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and as such include adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks.
Certain securities are held in collective trust funds which are valued using net asset values provided by the administrators of the funds.
Investments in private equity, debt, real estate and hedge funds and direct private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner.
Investments in real estate properties are valued on a quarterly basis using the income approach.
Valuation estimates are periodically supplemented by third party appraisals.
Our general funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards.
In 2017, 2016, and 2015, we were not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans and no contributions were made.
We are not required to make any contributions to our U.S. pension plans in 2018.
In 2017, contributions of $136 million were made to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding requirements.
In 2018, we expect to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $142 million to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards.
Contributions for both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans do not reflect benefits paid directly from Company assets.
Benefit payments, including amounts to be paid from Company assets, and reflecting expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows: U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans 2018 $ 1,170 $ 261 2019 1,159 256 2020 1,165 264 2021 1,169 271 2022 1,176 289 2023-2027 5,795 1,477 Other Postretirement Benefits December 31, 2017 2016 Assumed health care cost trend rate: Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year 6.50 % 6.50 % Rate that the cost trend rate gradually declines to 5.00 % 5.00 % Year that the rate reaches the rate it is assumed to remain at 2023 2023 The assumed health care cost trend rate has a significant effect on the amounts reported.

Segment Financial Data We globally manage our business operations through four reportable operating segments.
Segment information is consistent with how management reviews the businesses, makes investing and resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance.
Honeywell’s senior management evaluates segment performance based on segment profit.
Segment profit is measured as segment income (loss) before taxes excluding general corporate unallocated expense, other income (expense), interest and other financial charges, stock compensation expenses, pension and other postretirement benefits (expense), stock compensation expense and repositioning and other charges.
Effective October 2017, the Company realigned the Smart Energy business, previously part of the Home and Building Technologies segment, into the Process Solutions business within the Performance Materials and Technologies segment.
Effective July 2016, the Company realigned the business units comprising its Automation and Control Solutions reporting segment by forming two new reportable operating segments: Home and Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions.
These realignments have no impact on the Company’s historical consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period segment presentation.

87 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm TO THE SHAREOWNERS AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Honeywell International Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).
We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks.
Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and 88 dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
