38 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Note 1.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting Principles—The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The following is a description of Honeywell’s significant accounting policies.
Principles of Consolidation—The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Honeywell International Inc. and all of its subsidiaries and entities in which a controlling interest is maintained.
Our consolidation policy requires equity investments that we exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee’s activities to be accounted for using the equity method.
Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which we do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.
All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.
Redeemable noncontrolling interest is considered to be temporary equity and is therefore reported outside of permanent equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the greater of the initial carrying amount adjusted for the noncontrolling interest’s share of net income (loss) or its redemption value.
Property, Plant and Equipment—Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including any asset retirement obligations, less accumulated depreciation.
For financial reporting, the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and 2 to 16 years for machinery and equipment.
Recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs.
Upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding asset’s useful life.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets—Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value.
We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2016 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date.
Other Intangible Assets with Determinable Lives—Other intangible assets with determinable lives consist of customer lists, technology, patents and trademarks and other intangibles and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 24 years.
Sales Recognition—Product and service sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance and engineering activities are recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered.
Sales under long-term contracts are recorded on a percentage-of-completion method measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts.
Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full when such losses become evident.
Revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements are recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element provided the delivered elements have value to customers on a standalone basis.
Amounts allocated to each element are based on its objectively determined fair value, such as the sales price for the product or service when it is sold separately or competitor prices for similar products or services.
Environmental—We accrue costs related to environmental matters when it is probable that we have incurred a liability related to a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
For additional information, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies.
Asbestos Related Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries—We recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable.
In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable.
For additional information, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies.
Aerospace Sales Incentives—We provide sales incentives to commercial aircraft manufacturers and airlines in connection with their selection of our aircraft equipment, predominately wheel and braking system hardware, avionics, and auxiliary power units, for installation on commercial aircraft.
These incentives consist of 39 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) free or deeply discounted products, credits for future purchases of product and upfront cash payments.
These costs are recognized in the period incurred as cost of products sold or as a reduction to sales, as appropriate.
Research and Development—Research and development costs for company-sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred.
Such costs are principally included in cost of products sold and were $2,143 million, $1,856 million and $1,892 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Stock-Based Compensation Plans—The principal awards issued under our stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 18 Stock-Based Compensation Plans, are non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units.
The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award.
The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award) and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant to recognize expense for those awards that are expected to vest and are based on our historical forfeiture rates.
Pension Benefits—We recognize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation (the corridor) annually in the fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment), and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered.
The remaining components of pension (income) expense, primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recognized on a quarterly basis (Pension ongoing (income) expense).
Foreign Currency Translation— Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than U.S.
Dollars are translated into U.S.
Dollars using year-end exchange rates.
Sales, costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year.
Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates.
Remeasurement adjustments for these subsidiaries are included in earnings.
Derivative Financial Instruments— We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risk and are not used for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments.
Derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract.
Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract.
All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value.
For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair values of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current earnings.
For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact earnings.
Cash flows of such derivative financial instruments are classified consistent with the underlying hedged item.
Income Taxes— Significant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions.
We establish additional reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold.
The approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance which determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority.
In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities.
We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change in estimate become known.
40 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Cash and cash equivalents— Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less.
Earnings Per Share—Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding.
Reclassifications—Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements—We consider the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs).
ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows (consolidated financial statements).
In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized.
Other major provisions include capitalization of certain contract costs, consideration of time value of money in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances.
The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers.
The effective date was deferred for one year to the interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017.
Early adoption is permitted as of the original effective date – interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016.
The guidance permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
We have not yet selected a transition method.
We are still finalizing the analysis to quantify the adoption impact of the provisions of the new standard, but we do not currently expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Based on the evaluation of our current contracts and revenue streams, most will be recorded consistently under both the current and new standard.
The FASB has issued, and may issue in the future, interpretive guidance which may cause our evaluation to change.
We believe we are following an appropriate timeline to allow for proper recognition, presentation and disclosure upon adoption effective the beginning of fiscal year 2018.
In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for leases which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets for the rights and obligations created by those leases.
The guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases that will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.
Early adoption is permitted.
The guidance requires the use of a modified retrospective approach.
We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and related notes to financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance related to the employee share-based payment accounting.
The guidance requires all income tax effect of awards to be recognized in the income statement, which were previously presented as a component of Total shareowners’ equity, on a prospective basis.
The guidance also requires presentation of excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity.
We have elected to early adopt the standard in the quarter ended September 30, 2016, which requires adoption effective as of the beginning of the fiscal year.
The adoption resulted in a diluted earnings per share benefit of $0.14 and the recognition of excess tax benefits as a reduction in the provision for income taxes of $127 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Refer to Note 24 Unaudited Quarterly Financial Information for the earnings per share for the first and second quarters of 2016, recast to reflect the impact from adoption.
Cash paid by the Company when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes are classified as a financing activity on a retrospective basis.
41 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The guidance allows for an accounting policy election to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur.
We elected to maintain the current forfeitures policy and will continue to include an estimate of those forfeitures when recognizing stock compensation expense.
Classification of the excess tax benefits in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows are presented on a prospective basis as of January 1, 2016.
In August 2016, the FASB issued new guidance intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and payments are classified in the statement of cash flows, including debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, the settlement of contingent liabilities arising from a business combination, proceeds from insurance settlements, and distributions from certain equity method investees.
The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted.
The guidance requires application on a retrospective basis.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance.
In October 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs.
Under current GAAP, recognition of the income tax consequences for asset transfers other than inventory could not be recognized until the asset was sold to a third party.
The guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice related to the tax consequences of certain types of intra-entity asset transfers, particularly those involving intellectual property.
The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted.
The guidance requires application on a modified retrospective basis.
We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements.
Note 2.
Acquisitions and Divestitures During 2016 and 2015, we acquired businesses for an aggregate cost (net of cash and debt assumed) of $2,538 million and $5,244 million.
In August 2016, the Company acquired Intelligrated, a leading provider of supply chain and warehouse automation technologies, for an aggregate value, net of cash acquired, of $1,488 million.
Intelligrated is part of Safety and Productivity Solutions.
The preliminary determination of the assets and liabilities acquired with Intelligrated have been included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016, including $1,129 million allocated to goodwill, which is non-deductible for tax purposes.
In April 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Xtralis International Holdings Limited (Xtralis), a leading global provider of aspiration smoke detection and perimeter security technologies, for an aggregate cost, net of cash acquired and debt assumed, of $515 million.
Xtralis is part of Home and Building Technologies.
In February 2016, the Company acquired 100 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of COM DEV International (COM DEV), a leading satellite and space components provider, for an aggregate value, net of cash acquired and debt assumed, of $347 million.
COM DEV is part of Aerospace and had reported 2015 fiscal year revenues of $159 million.
In January 2016, the Company acquired the remaining 30 percent noncontrolling interest in UOP Russell LLC, which develops technology and manufactures modular equipment to process natural gas, for $240 million.
UOP Russell LLC is part of Performance Materials and Technologies.
In December 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of the Elster Division of Melrose Industries plc (Elster), for an aggregate value, net of cash acquired, of $4,899 million.
Elster had 2015 revenues of $1,670 million and has been integrated into Home and Building Technologies and Performance Materials and Technologies.
The following table summarizes the final fair value of the acquired Elster assets and liabilities.
42 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Current assets	 $519 Intangible assets	 2,163 Other noncurrent assets	 193 Current liabilities	 (566) Noncurrent liabilities	 (973) Net assets acquired	 1,336 Noncontrolling interest	 (2) Goodwill	 3,565 Purchase Price	 $4,899 The Elster identifiable intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, trade names and technology that are being amortized over their estimated lives ranging from 1 to 20 years using straight line and accelerated amortization methods.
The goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes.
As of December 31, 2016, the purchase accounting for Intelligrated, Xtralis and COM DEV is subject to final adjustment, primarily for the valuation of amounts allocated to intangible assets and goodwill, determination of useful lives for definite-lived intangible assets, tax balances and for any pre-acquisition contingencies.
Goodwill arising from these acquisitions is non-deductible for tax purposes.
The results of operations from date of acquisition through December 31, 2016 are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
On October 1, 2016, the Company completed the tax-free spin-off of its Resins and Chemicals business, part of Performance Materials and Technologies, into a standalone, publicly-traded company (named AdvanSix Inc. or AdvanSix) to Honeywell shareowners.
The assets and liabilities associated with AdvanSix have been removed from the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The results of operations for AdvanSix are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations through the effective date of the spin-off.
Honeywell shareowners of record as of the close of business on September 16, 2016 received one share of AdvanSix common stock for every 25 shares of Honeywell common stock.
Immediately prior to the effective date of the spin-off, AdvanSix incurred debt to make a cash distribution of $269 million to the Company.
At the same time, AdvanSix also incurred $38 million of borrowings in order to fund its post spin-off working capital.

The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives; the separation of the former Automation and Control Solutions reporting segment into two new reporting segments; factory transitions in each of our reportable operating segments to more cost-effective locations; and achieving acquisition-related synergies.
The repositioning charge included asset impairments of $43 million principally related to the write-off of certain intangible assets in connection with the sale of a Performance Materials and Technologies business.
The repositioning charge included exit costs of $43 million principally for expenses related to the spin-off of our AdvanSix business and closure obligations associated with factory transitions.
Also, $109 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, were returned to income as a result of higher attrition than anticipated in prior severance programs resulting in lower required severance payments, lower than expected severance costs in certain repositioning actions, and changes in scope of previously announced repositioning actions.
44 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) In 2015, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $216 million including severance costs of $197 million related to workforce reductions of 6,405 manufacturing and administrative positions across our segments.
The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives.
Also, $53 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, were returned to income due principally to higher attrition than anticipated in prior severance programs resulting in lower required severance payments, and changes in scope of previously announced repositioning actions.
In 2014, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $184 million including severance costs of $156 million related to workforce reductions of 2,975 manufacturing and administrative positions across our segments.
The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives; factory transitions in Home and Building Technologies, Safety and Productivity Solutions and Aerospace to more cost-effective locations; and site consolidations and organizational realignments of businesses in Home and Building Technologies, Safety and Productivity Solutions and Performance Materials and Technologies.
Also, $38 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, were returned to income due principally to the change in scope of a previously announced repositioning action and higher attrition than anticipated in prior severance programs resulting in lower required severance payments.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 The U.S. federal statutory income tax rate is reconciled to our effective income tax rate as follows: U.S. federal statutory income tax rate 35.0% 35.0% 35.0% Taxes on non-U.S. earnings below U.S. tax rate(1) (8.0) (8.0) (7.0) U.S. state income taxes(1) 1.1 1.2 1.2 Manufacturing incentives (0.7) (1.5) (1.0) Employee stock ownership plan dividend tax benefit (0.5) (0.4) (0.4) Tax credits (0.7) (1.0) (1.0) Reserves for tax contingencies 1.2 0.7 (0.2) Employee share-based payments (2.0) - - All other items—net (0.6) 0.4 (1.0) 24.8% 26.4% 25.6% (1)Net of changes in valuation allowance The effective tax rate decreased by 1.6 percentage points in 2016 compared to 2015.
The decrease was primarily attributable to excess tax benefits from employee share-based payments arising from adoption of the FASB’s amended guidance related to employee share-based payment accounting, partially offset by increased tax reserves in various jurisdictions and lower tax benefits from manufacturing incentives.
The Company’s non-U.S. effective tax rate was 16.7%, a decrease of approximately 2.8 percentage points compared to 2015.
The year-over-year decrease in the non-U.S. effective tax rate was primarily driven by higher earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions and a decrease in the tax impact of restructuring and divestitures.
The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to overall non-U.S. earnings taxed at lower rates.
The effective tax rate increased by 0.8 percentage points in 2015 compared to 2014.
The increase was primarily attributable to decreased tax benefits from the resolution of tax audits, partially offset by increased tax benefits from manufacturing incentives, the impact of more income in jurisdictions with lower tax rates and fewer reserves.
The Company’s non-U.S. effective tax rate for 2015 was 19.5%, a decrease of approximately 1.8 percentage points compared to 2014.
The year-over-year decrease in the non-U.S. effective tax rate was primarily attributable to higher earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions coupled with lower expense related to reserves in various jurisdictions, partially offset by an increase from the tax impact of restructuring and dispositions.
The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to overall non-U.S. earnings taxed at lower rates.
Deferred tax assets (liabilities) The tax effects of temporary differences and tax carryforwards which give rise to future income tax benefits and payables are as follows: 47 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) December 31, Deferred tax assets: 2016 2015 Pension $411 $500 Postretirement benefits other than pensions 262 292 Asbestos and environmental 471 473 Employee compensation and benefits 418 387 Other accruals and reserves 765 626 Net operating and capital losses 669 620 Tax credit carryforwards 206 198 Gross deferred tax assets 3,202 3,096 Valuation allowance (621) (589) Total deferred tax assets $2,581 $2,507

Our gross deferred tax assets include $1,034 million related to non-U.S. operations comprised principally of net operating losses, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards (mainly in Canada, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom) and deductible temporary differences.
We maintain a valuation allowance of $619 million against a portion of the non-U.S. gross deferred tax assets.
The change in the valuation allowance resulted in an increase of $69 million, increase of $114 million and decrease of $10 million to income tax expense in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
In the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, we will reduce such amounts through an increase to income tax expense in the period such determination is made.
Conversely, if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a reduction to income tax expense in the period that such determination is made.
As of December 31, 2016, our net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards were as follows: Jurisdiction Expiration Period Net Operating and Capital Loss Carryforwards Tax Credit Carryforwards U.S. Federal 2036 $25 $55 U.S. State 2036 720 26 Non-U.S. 2035 651 137 Non-U.S.
Indefinite 2,186 - $3,582 $218 Many jurisdictions impose limitations on the timing and utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
In those instances whereby there is an expected permanent limitation on the utilization of the net operating loss or tax credit carryforward the deferred tax asset and amount of the carryforward have been reduced.
U.S. federal income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of the vast majority of our international subsidiaries as it is our intention to reinvest these earnings into the respective subsidiaries.
At 48 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) December 31, 2016 Honeywell has not provided for U.S. federal income and non-U.S. withholding taxes on approximately $18.3 billion of such earnings of our non-U.S. operations.
It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability.

Based on the outcome of these examinations, or as a result of the expiration of statute of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns will materially change from those recorded as liabilities in our financial statements.
In addition, the outcome of these examinations may impact the valuation of certain deferred tax assets (such as net operating losses) in future periods.
Unrecognized tax benefits for examinations in progress were $398 million, $349 million and $403 million, as of December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.
Estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes are classified as a component of Tax Expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and totaled $18 million, $11 million and $24 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.
Accrued interest and penalties were $395 million, $336 million and $325 million, as of December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.

Note 14.
Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures Credit and Market Risk—Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest and currency exchange rates.
We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk.
Our counterparties in derivative transactions are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments.
We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities.
We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business.
The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer.
Our sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers.
Foreign Currency Risk Management—We conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies.
Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and transactions arising from international trade.
Our primary objective is to preserve the U.S. Dollar value of foreign currency denominated cash flows and earnings.
We attempt to hedge currency exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts (foreign currency exchange contracts) with third parties.
We hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
Prior to conversion into U.S. dollars, these assets and liabilities are remeasured at spot exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date.
The effects of changes in spot rates are recognized in earnings and included in other (income) expense.
We partially hedge forecasted sales and purchases, which occur in the next twelve months and are denominated in non-functional currencies, with foreign currency exchange contracts.
Changes in the forecasted non-functional currency cash flows due to movements in exchange rates are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the foreign currency exchange contracts designated as hedges.
Market value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized.
Open foreign currency exchange contracts mature in the next twelve months.
At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had contracts with notional amounts of $9,554 million and $10,538 million to exchange foreign currencies, principally the U.S. Dollar, Euro, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Renminbi, Indian Rupee, Mexican Peso, Singapore Dollar, U.A.E.
Dirham and Swiss Franc.
We have also designated foreign currency debt as hedges against portions of our net investment in foreign operations during the year ended December 31, 2016.
Gains or losses on the effective portion of the foreign currency debt designated as a net investment hedge are recorded in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments.
The Company did not have ineffectiveness related to net investment hedges during the year ended December 31, 2016.
55 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Interest Rate Risk Management—We use a combination of financial instruments, including long-term, medium-term and short-term financing, variable-rate commercial paper, and interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing.
At December 31, 2016 and 2015, interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges effectively changed $1,850 million and $1,100 million of fixed rate debt at rates of 3.39% and 4.00% to LIBOR based floating rate debt.
Our interest rate swaps mature at various dates through 2026.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments—The FASB’s accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
Financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2016 and 2015: December 31, 2016 2015 Assets: 
 Foreign currency exchange contracts $152 $28 Available for sale investments 1,670 1,501 Interest rate swap agreements 69 92 
 Liabilities: 
 Foreign currency exchange contracts $2 $17 Interest rate swap agreements 48 - The foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements are valued using broker quotations, or market transactions in either the listed or over-the-counter markets.
As such, these derivative instruments are classified within level 2.
The Company also holds investments in commercial paper, certificates of deposits, and time deposits that are designated as available for sale and are valued using published prices based off observable market data.
As such, these investments are classified within level 2.
The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts and notes receivables, payables, commercial paper and short-term borrowings contained in the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximates fair value.
The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that were not carried at fair value: December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Assets

 Long-term debt and related current maturities $12,409 $13,008 $6,131 $6,721 The Company determined the fair value of the long-term receivables by discounting based upon the terms of the receivable and counterparty details including credit quality.
As such, the fair value of these receivables is considered level 2.
The Company determined the fair value of the long-term debt and related current maturities utilizing transactions in the listed markets for identical or similar liabilities.
As such, the fair value of the long-term debt and related current maturities is considered level 2 as well.
Interest rate swap agreements are designated as hedge relationships with gains or losses on the derivative recognized in interest and other financial charges offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying debt 56 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) being hedged.
Losses on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $71 million and $2 million in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
Gains on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $38 million in the year ended December 31, 2014.
Gains and losses are fully offset by losses and gains on the underlying debt being hedged.
We also economically hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally with forward contracts.
These contracts are marked-to-market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings offsetting the gains and losses on the non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being hedged.
We recognized $232 million of income in other (income) expense in the year ended December 31, 2016.
We recognize $86 million and $181 million of expense in other (income) expense in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans The 2016 Stock Incentive Plan of Honeywell International Inc. and its Affiliates (2016 Plan) and 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. (2016 Directors Plan) were both approved by the shareowners at the Annual Meeting of Shareowners effective on April 25, 2016.
Following approval of both plans, we have not and will not grant any new awards under any previously existing stock-based compensation plans.
At December 31, 2016, there were 46,365,609, and 960,609 shares of Honeywell common stock available for future grants under terms of the 2016 Plan and 2016 Directors Plan, respectively.
Stock Options—The exercise price, term and other conditions applicable to each option granted under our stock plans are generally determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board.
The exercise price of stock options is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share of our stock on that date.
The fair value is recognized as an expense over the employee’s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award).
Options generally vest over a four-year period and expire after ten years.
The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock and historical volatility of our common stock.
We used a Monte Carlo simulation model to derive an expected term which represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding.
Such model uses historical data to estimate option exercise activity and post-vest termination behavior.
The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
Compensation cost on a pre-tax basis related to stock options recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $87 million, $78 million and $85 million.
The associated future income tax benefit recognized in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $29 million, $26 million and $31 million.

Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment.
We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations.
However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances.
Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future.
With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we continually conduct studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques.
It is our policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work.
The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available.
Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of 63 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) our recorded liabilities.
We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow.
The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of remedial investigations and feasibility studies, the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties.
The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded liabilities for environmental costs: Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Beginning of year	 $518 $591 $643 Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable	 195 194 268 Environmental liability payments	 (228) (273) (321) Other	 26 6 1 End of year	 $511 $518 $591 Environmental liabilities are included in the following balance sheet accounts: December 31, 2016 2015 Accrued liabilities	 $252 $253 Other liabilities	 259 265 $511 $518 We do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of environmental liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined although they could be material to our consolidated results of operations and operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid.
However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position.
Onondaga Lake, Syracuse, NY—In 2016, we largely completed a dredging/capping remedy of Onondaga Lake pursuant to a consent decree approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York in January 2007.
Some additional long-term monitoring and maintenance activities will continue, as required by the consent decree.
Honeywell is also conducting remedial investigations and activities at other sites in Syracuse.
We have recorded reserves for these investigations and activities where appropriate, consistent with the accounting policy described above.
Honeywell has entered into a cooperative agreement with potential natural resource trustees to assess alleged natural resource damages relating to this site.
It is not possible to predict the outcome or duration of this assessment, or the amounts of, or responsibility for, any damages.
Asbestos Matters Honeywell is a defendant in asbestos related personal injury actions related to two predecessor companies: ·North American Refractories Company (NARCO), which was sold in 1986, produced refractory products (bricks and cement used in high temperature applications).
Claimants consist largely of individuals who allege exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing refractory products in an occupational setting.
·Bendix Friction Materials (Bendix) business, which was sold in 2014, manufactured automotive brake parts that contained chrysotile asbestos in an encapsulated form.
Claimants consist largely of individuals who allege exposure to asbestos from brakes from either performing or being in the vicinity of individuals who performed brake replacements.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) and future NARCO asbestos claims.
Both Honeywell and NARCO are protected by a permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal courts and requiring all asbestos related claims based on exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing products to be made against the NARCO Trust.
The NARCO Trust reviews submitted claims and determines award amounts in accordance with established Trust Distribution Procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court which set forth the criteria claimants must meet to qualify for compensation including, among other things, exposure and medical criteria that determine the award amount.
In addition, Honeywell provided, and continues to provide, input to the design of control procedures for processing NARCO claims, and has on-going audit rights to review and monitor the claims processors’ adherence to the established requirements of the Trust Distribution Procedures.
Honeywell is obligated to fund NARCO asbestos claims submitted to the NARCO Trust which qualify for payment under the Trust Distribution Procedures (Annual Contribution Claims), subject to annual caps of $140 million in the years 2017 and 2018 and $145 million for each year thereafter.
However, the initial $100 million of claims processed through the NARCO Trust (the Initial Claims Amount) will not count against the annual cap and any unused portion of the Initial Claims Amount will roll over to subsequent years until fully utilized.
In 2015, Honeywell filed suit against the NARCO Trust in Bankruptcy Court alleging breach of certain provisions of the Trust Agreement and Trust Distribution Procedures.
The parties agreed to dismiss the proceeding without prejudice pursuant to an 18 month Standstill Agreement that expires in October 2017.
Claims processing will continue during this period subject to a defined dispute resolution process.
As of December 31, 2016, Honeywell has not made any payments to the NARCO Trust for Annual Contribution Claims.
Honeywell is also responsible for payments due to claimants pursuant to settlement agreements reached during the pendency of the NARCO bankruptcy proceedings that provide for the right to submit claims to the NARCO Trust subject to qualification under the terms of the settlement agreements and Trust Distribution Procedures criteria (Pre-established Unliquidated Claims), which amounts are estimated at $150 million and are expected to be paid during the initial years of trust operations ($5 million of which has been paid since the effective date of the NARCO Trust).
Such payments are not subject to the annual cap described above.
Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for pre-established unliquidated claims ($145 million), unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection ($31 million) and for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust ($743 million).
The estimate of future NARCO claims is based on a commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524(g) trusts and also reflects disputes concerning implementation of the Trust Distribution Procedures by the NARCO Trust, a lack of sufficient trust claims processing experience, as well as the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims which remained in place throughout NARCO’s Chapter 11 case.
Some critical assumptions underlying this commonly accepted methodology include claims filing rates, disease criteria and payment values contained in the Trust Distribution Procedures, estimated approval rates of claims submitted to the NARCO Trust and epidemiological studies estimating disease instances.
The estimated value of future NARCO claims was originally established at the time of the NARCO Chapter 11 filing reflecting claims expected to be asserted against NARCO over a fifteen year period.
This projection resulted in a range of estimated liability of $743 million to $961 million.
We believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount and accordingly, we have recorded the minimum amount in the range.
Our insurance receivable corresponding to the estimated liability for pending and future NARCO asbestos claims reflects coverage which reimburses Honeywell for portions of NARCO-related indemnity and defense costs and is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market.
We conduct analyses to estimate the probable amount of insurance that is recoverable for asbestos claims.
While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries.
We made judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers.
Projecting future events is subject to many uncertainties that could cause the NARCO-related asbestos liabilities or assets to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded.
Given the uncertainties, we review our estimates periodically, and update them based on our experience and other relevant factors.
Similarly, we will reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability or other developments that may impact insurance recoveries.
66 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Bendix Products—The following tables present information regarding Bendix related asbestos claims activity: Years Ended December 31, Claims Activity 2016 2015 Claims Unresolved at the beginning of year 7,779 9,267 Claims Filed 2,830 2,862 Claims Resolved (2,885) (4,350) Claims Unresolved at the end of year 7,724 7,779 December 31, Disease Distribution of Unresolved Claims 2016 2015 Mesothelioma and Other Cancer Claims 3,490 3,772 Nonmalignant Claims 4,234 4,007 Total Claims 7,724 7,779 Honeywell has experienced average resolution values per claim excluding legal costs as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 (in whole dollars) Malignant claims $44,000 $44,000 $53,500 $51,000 $49,000 Nonmalignant claims $4,485 $100 $120 $850 $1,400 It is not possible to predict whether resolution values for Bendix-related asbestos claims will increase, decrease or stabilize in the future.
Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for resolution of pending (claims actually filed as of the financial statement date) and future Bendix-related asbestos claims.
We have valued Bendix pending and future claims using average resolution values for the previous five years.
We update the resolution values used to estimate the cost of Bendix pending and future claims during the fourth quarter each year.
The liability for future claims represents the estimated value of future asbestos related bodily injury claims expected to be asserted against Bendix over the next five years.
Such estimated cost of future Bendix-related asbestos claims is based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years.
In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years.
The methodology used to estimate the liability for future claims is similar to that used to estimate the liability for future NARCO-related asbestos claims.
Our insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of pending and future Bendix asbestos claims reflects coverage which is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market.
Based on our ongoing analysis of the probable insurance recovery, insurance receivables are recorded in the financial statements simultaneous with the recording of the estimated liability for the underlying asbestos claims.
This determination is based on our analysis of the underlying insurance policies, our historical experience with our insurers, our ongoing review of the solvency of our insurers, judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs, and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements reached with our insurers.
67 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Honeywell believes it has sufficient insurance coverage and reserves to cover all pending Bendix-related asbestos claims and Bendix-related asbestos claims estimated to be filed within the next five years.
Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of either pending or future Bendix-related asbestos claims, we do not believe that such claims would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position in light of our insurance coverage and our prior experience in resolving such claims.
If the rate and types of claims filed, the average resolution value of such claims and the period of time over which claim settlements are paid (collectively, the Variable Claims Factors) do not substantially change, Honeywell would not expect future Bendix-related asbestos claims to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in any fiscal year.
No assurances can be given, however, that the Variable Claims Factors will not change.
Other Matters We are subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters.
We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable.
We continually assess the likelihood of adverse judgments of outcomes in these matters, as well as potential ranges of possible losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts.
Included in these other matters are the following: Honeywell v. United Auto Workers (UAW) et.
al—In July 2011, Honeywell filed an action in federal court (District of New Jersey) against the UAW and all former employees who retired under a series of Master Collective Bargaining Agreements (MCBAs) between Honeywell and the UAW seeking a declaratory judgment that certain express limitations on its obligation to contribute toward the healthcare coverage of such retirees (the CAPS) set forth in the MCBAs may be implemented, effective January 1, 2012.
The UAW and certain retiree defendants filed a mirror suit in the Eastern District of Michigan alleging that the MCBAs do not provide for CAPS on the Company’s liability for healthcare coverage.
The New Jersey action was dismissed and Honeywell subsequently answered the UAW’s complaint in Michigan and asserted counterclaims for fraudulent inducement, negligent misrepresentation and breach of implied warranty.
The UAW filed a motion to dismiss these counterclaims.
The court dismissed Honeywell’s fraudulent inducement and negligent misrepresentation claims, but let stand the claim for breach of implied warranty.
In the second quarter of 2014, the parties agreed to stay the proceedings with respect to those retirees who retired before the initial inclusions of the CAPS in the 2003 MCBA until the Supreme Court decided the M&G Polymers USA, LLC v. Tackett case.
In a ruling on January 26, 2015, the Supreme Court held that retiree health insurance benefits provided in collective bargaining agreements do not carry an inference that they are vested or guaranteed to continue for life and that the “vesting” issue must be decided pursuant to ordinary principles of contract law.
The stay of the proceedings has been lifted and the case is again proceeding.
Based on the Supreme Court’s ruling, Honeywell is confident that the CAPS will be upheld and that its liability for healthcare coverage premiums with respect to the putative class will be limited as negotiated and expressly set forth in the applicable MCBAs.
In the event of an adverse ruling, however, Honeywell’s other postretirement benefits for pre-2003 retirees would increase by approximately $129 million, reflecting the estimated value of these CAPS.
In December 2013, the UAW and certain of the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment with respect to those retirees who retired after the initial inclusion of the CAPS in the 2003 MCBA.
The UAW sought a ruling that the 2003 MCBA did not limit Honeywell’s obligation to contribute to healthcare coverage for the post-2003 retirees.
That motion remains pending.
Honeywell is confident that the Court will find that the 2003 MCBA does, in fact, limit Honeywell’s retiree healthcare obligation for post-2003 retirees.
In the event of an adverse ruling, however, Honeywell’s other postretirement benefits for post-2003 retirees would increase by approximately $95 million, reflecting the estimated value of these CAPS.
Joint Strike Fighter Investigation - In 2013 the Company received subpoenas from the Department of Justice requesting information relating primarily to parts manufactured in the United Kingdom and China used in the F-35 fighter jet.
The Company is cooperating fully with the investigation.
While we believe that Honeywell has complied with all relevant U.S. laws and regulations regarding the manufacture of these sensors, it is not possible 68 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) to predict the outcome of the investigation or what action, if any, may result from it.
Given the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations (including the specific matters referenced above), we do not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters (other than as specifically set forth above).
Considering our past experience and existing accruals, we do not expect the outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position.
Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid.
Warranties and Guarantees In the normal course of business we issue product warranties and product performance guarantees.
We accrue for the estimated cost of product warranties and performance guarantees based on contract terms and historical experience at the time of sale.
Adjustments to initial obligations for warranties and guarantees are made as changes to the obligations become reasonably estimable.
The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded obligations for product warranties and product performance guarantees.
Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Beginning of year $416 $403 $405 Accruals for warranties/guarantees issued during the year 326 206 225 Adjustment of pre-existing warranties/guarantees (40) 13 (34) Settlement of warranty/guarantee claims (215) (206) (193) End of year $487 $416 $403 Product warranties and product performance guarantees are included in the following balance sheet accounts: December 31, 2016 2015 Accrued liabilities $351 $355 Other liabilities 136 61 $487 $416 Note 20.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees.
Pension benefits for many of our U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans.
All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywell’s U.S. defined benefit pension plans.
We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada.
Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate.
We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees.
None of Honeywell’s U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company.
In addition, more than 80% of Honeywell’s U.S. retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount.
This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases.
The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded.
Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow.

 Actuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for years ended December 31: 
 
 Discount rate 3.80% 3.45% 4.05% The discount rate for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefits plans reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be settled at the measurement date of December 31.
To determine discount rates for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we use a modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of our benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments.
We use the single weighted-average yield of this hypothetical portfolio as a discount rate benchmark.
The discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is lower principally due to a shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations.
During the fourth quarter of 2015 we changed the methodology used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit (income) cost for our significant pension plans.
Previously, we estimated such cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the pension benefit obligation.
The new methodology utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these cost components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the pension benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and their corresponding spot rates.
The change did not affect the measurement of our pension obligation and was applied prospectively as a change in estimate.
For our U.S. pension plans, the single weighted average spot rates used to determine service and interest costs for 2017 are 4.42% and 3.49%.
Our expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets of 7.75% is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations.
We review the expected rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate.
For non-U.S. benefit plans actuarial assumptions reflect economic and market factors relevant to each country.
Pension Benefits Included in the aggregate data in the tables above are the amounts applicable to our pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets.
Amounts related to such plans were as follows: December 31, U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans 2016 2015 2016 2015 Projected benefit obligation $17,414 $17,298 $2,294 $1,624 Accumulated benefit obligation $17,263 $16,899 $2,220 $1,574 Fair value of plan assets $16,814 $16,349 $1,552 $976 Accumulated benefit obligation for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $17.3 billion and $16.9 billion and for our Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $6.4 billion and $6.2 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015.
Our asset investment strategy for our U.S. pension plans focuses on maintaining a diversified portfolio using various asset classes in order to achieve our long-term investment objectives on a risk adjusted basis.
Our 74 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) actual invested positions in various securities change over time based on short and longer-term investment opportunities.
To achieve our objectives, we have established long-term target allocations as follows: 60%-70% equity securities, 10%-20% fixed income securities and cash, 5%-15% real estate investments, and 10%-20% other types of investments.
Equity securities include publicly-traded stock of companies located both inside and outside the United States.
Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries.
Real estate investments include direct investments in commercial properties and investments in real estate funds.
Other types of investments include investments in private equity and hedge funds that follow several different strategies.
We review our assets on a regular basis to ensure that we are within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations.
Our non-U.S. pension assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees with the Honeywell Corporate Investments group providing funding and investment guidance.
Our non-U.S. investment policies are different for each country as local regulations, funding requirements, and financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country.
In accordance with ASU 2015-07, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)”, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value amounts presented in the following tables are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented for the total pension benefits plan assets.

Sufficient cash or cash equivalents are held by our pension plans to cover the notional value of the futures contracts.
At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $3,775 million and $2,613 million.
At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our non-U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $55 million and $54 million.
In both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, the notional derivative exposure is primarily related to outstanding equity futures contracts.
Common stocks, preferred stocks, real estate investment trusts, and short-term investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.
Corporate bonds, mortgages, asset-backed securities, and government securities are valued either by using pricing models, bids provided by brokers or dealers, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and as such include adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks.
Certain securities are held in collective trust funds which are valued using net asset values provided by the administrators of the funds.
Investments in private equity, debt, real estate and hedge funds and direct private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner.
Investments in real estate properties are valued on a quarterly basis using the income approach.
Valuation estimates are periodically supplemented by third party appraisals.
Our general funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards.
In 2016, 2015 and 2014, we were not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans and no contributions were made.
We are not required to make any contributions to our U.S. pension plans in 2017.
In 2016, contributions of $149 million were made to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding requirements.
In 2017, we expect to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $130 million to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards.
Contributions for both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans do not reflect benefits paid directly from Company assets.
Benefit payments, including amounts to be paid from Company assets, and reflecting expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows: 78 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Segment Financial Data We globally manage our business operations through four reportable operating segments.
Segment information is consistent with how management reviews the businesses, makes investing and resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance.
Honeywell’s senior management evaluates segment performance based on segment profit.
Segment profit is measured as business unit income (loss) before taxes excluding general corporate unallocated expense, other income (expense), interest and other financial charges, pension and other postretirement benefits (expense), stock compensation expense and repositioning and other charges.
In July 2016, the Company announced the realignment of the business units comprising its Automation and Control Solutions reporting segment by forming two new reportable operating segments: Home and Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions.
Home and Building Technologies includes Environmental & Energy Solutions, Security and Fire, and Building Solutions and Distribution.
Additionally, the Industrial Combustion/Thermal business, previously part of Environmental & Energy Solutions in Automation and Control Solutions, became part of Performance Materials and Technologies.
Safety and Productivity Solutions includes 79 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Sensing & Productivity Solutions and Industrial Safety, as well as the Intelligrated business.
Under the realigned segment reporting structure, the Company’s reportable operating segments are Aerospace, Home and Building Technologies, Performance Materials and Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions.
These realignments have no impact on the Company’s historical consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period segment presentation.

Morris Plains, New Jersey: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Honeywell International Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and shareowners’ equity for the years then ended.
We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 based on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audits also included performing such procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Honeywell International Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
83 As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for employee share-based payments in 2016 and 2015 due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Update No.

/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Parsippany, New Jersey February 10, 2017 84 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Honeywell International Inc.: In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014 present fairly, in all material respects, the results of operations and cash flows of Honeywell International Inc. and its subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not Applicable.
Item 9A.
Controls and Procedures Honeywell management maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
There have been no changes that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting that have occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2016.
Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) at December 31, 2016.
Based on these evaluations, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 were effective as of December 31, 2016.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Honeywell management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Management assessed the effectiveness of Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.
In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013).
Based on this assessment, management determined that Honeywell maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.
The effectiveness of Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in
