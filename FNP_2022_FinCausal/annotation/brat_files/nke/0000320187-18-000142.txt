ITEM 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsNIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide.
We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world.
We sell our products through NIKE-owned retail stores and through digital platforms (which we refer to collectively as our “NIKE Direct” operations), to retail accounts and a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world.
Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses.
Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, “must have” products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail.In June 2017, we announced the Consumer Direct Offense, a new company alignment designed to allow NIKE to better serve the consumer personally, at scale.
Leveraging the power of digital, NIKE plans to drive growth — by accelerating innovation and product creation, moving even closer to the consumer through key cities, and deepening one-to-one connections.
As a result of this organizational realignment, beginning in fiscal 2018, the Company’s reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA); Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America (APLA).Through the Consumer Direct Offense, we are focusing on our Triple Double strategy, with the objective of doubling the impact of innovation, increasing our speed to market and growing our direct connections with consumers.
As a result of the execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals through fiscal 2023, on average, per year, are as follows:•High single-digit revenue growth;•Gross margin expansion of as much as 50 basis points;•Slight selling and administrative expense leverage;•Mid-teens earnings per share growth; and•Low-thirties percentage rate of return on invested capital.Over the past ten years, we have achieved strong growth in many of these metrics.
During this time, revenues for NIKE, Inc. have grown 7% on an annual compounded basis, annual gross margin has ranged from 43.5% to 46.4%, diluted earnings per common share has grown steadily and our return on invested capital has been as high as 34.7%.Our fiscal 2018 results demonstrated the power of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio to generate revenue growth, while investing in capabilities in support of our Triple Double strategy to fuel our next phase of long-term growth and profitability.
We achieved record revenues for fiscal 2018, growing 6% to $36.4 billion.
The NIKE Brand, which represents over 90% of NIKE, Inc.
Revenues, delivered 7% revenue growth.
On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand revenues grew 5%, driven by strong revenue growth across all international geographies and NIKE Direct, as well as growth in footwear, apparel and most key categories.
Revenues for Converse decreased 8% and 11% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively, primarily driven by lower revenues in North America.Income before income taxes decreased 11% for fiscal 2018, in part reflecting the negative impact of weakening foreign currency exchange rates.
Revenue growth was more than offset by higher selling and administrative expense, gross margin contraction, and a shift to other expense, net from other income, net for fiscal 2017.
NIKE, Inc. gross margin decreased 80 basis points primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate headwinds.
Selling and administrative expense was higher as a percent of revenues, reflecting investments in digital capabilities, consumer experiences and product and brand marketing to drive long-term growth under the Consumer Direct Offense.Diluted earnings per common share reflects a 2% decline in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, driven by our share repurchase program.While foreign currency markets remain volatile, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability, and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above.Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currency-neutral revenues, which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.
GAAP”).
References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no NIKE Direct operations.
NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our NIKE Direct operations, which are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers.
Additionally, currency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the Company’s performance, including when making financial and operating decisions.
Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends.
However, references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currency-neutral revenues should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.20Table of ContentsResults of Operations (Dollars in millions, except per share data) Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 % Change Fiscal 2016 % ChangeRevenues $36,397 $34,350 6 % $32,376 6 %Cost of sales 20,441 19,038 7 % 17,405 9 %Gross profit 15,956 15,312 4 % 14,971 2 %Gross margin 43.8% 44.6% 46.2% Demand creation expense 3,577 3,341 7 % 3,278 2 %Operating overhead expense 7,934 7,222 10 % 7,191 0 %Total selling and administrative expense 11,511 10,563 9 % 10,469 1 %% of revenues 31.6% 30.8% 32.3% Interest expense (income), net 54 59 — 19 —Other expense (income), net 66 (196) — (140) —Income before income taxes 4,325 4,886 -11 % 4,623 6 %Income tax expense 2,392 646 270 % 863 -25 %Effective tax rate 55.3% 13.2% 18.7% NET INCOME $1,933 $4,240 -54 % $3,760 13 %Diluted earnings per common share $1.17 $2.51 -53 % $2.16 16 %21Table of ContentsConsolidated Operating ResultsRevenues(Dollars in millions)Fiscal 2018Fiscal 2017(1)% Change% Change Excluding Currency Changes(2)Fiscal 2016(1)% Change% Change Excluding Currency Changes(2)NIKE, Inc.

Revenues grew 4% for fiscal 2018, driven by growth in the NIKE Brand.
All international NIKE Brand geographies delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2018 as our Consumer Direct Offense delivered innovative products, deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers through digital platforms and at NIKE-owned and retail partner stores, driving demand for NIKE Brand products.
Revenue growth was broad-based, as Greater China, EMEA and APLA each contributed approximately 2 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc.
Revenues.
For fiscal 2018, lower revenues from North America and Converse each reduced NIKE, Inc.
Revenues by approximately 1 percentage point.On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 4% and 9%, respectively, for fiscal 2018, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues decreased 4%.
On a category basis, the increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues was due to strong growth in Sportswear and Running, which was partially offset by lower revenues in several other categories, most notably the Jordan Brand.
Footwear unit sales for fiscal 2018 increased 2% and higher average selling price (ASP) per pair contributed approximately 2 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, primarily due to the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business.
The currency-neutral increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2018 was fueled by growth in nearly all key categories, most notably Sportswear, NIKE Basketball and Football (Soccer).
Unit sales of apparel increased 4% and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher ASPs from full-price, off-price and NIKE Direct sales.For fiscal 2018, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 30% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 28% for fiscal 2017.
On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 12% for fiscal 2018, driven by strong digital commerce sales growth of 25%, the addition of new stores and 4% comparable store sales growth.
Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year.
On a reported basis, digital commerce sales, which are not included in comparable store sales, were $2.8 billion for fiscal 2018 compared to $2.2 billion for fiscal 2017, and represented approximately 27% of our total NIKE Brand NIKE Direct revenues for fiscal 2018 compared to 24% for fiscal 2017.On a wholesale equivalent and currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2018 NIKE Brand Men’s revenues increased 5%, as growth in Sportswear, Running and NIKE Basketball more than offset lower Football (Soccer) and Jordan Brand revenues.
Women’s revenues increased 2%, led by growth in Sportswear, partially offset by a decline in Training.
Revenues for our Young Athletes’ business decreased 1%, as growth in Football (Soccer), was more than offset by lower revenues in the Jordan Brand.Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc.
Revenues grew 8% for fiscal 2017, driven by higher revenues for all NIKE Brand geographies and Converse.
Revenue growth was broad-based, as EMEA, Greater China, APLA and North America each contributed approximately 2 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. Revenues.On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 8% and 9%, respectively, for fiscal 2017, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues decreased 3%.
On a category basis, the increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues was driven by strong growth in Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand.
Footwear unit sales for fiscal 2017 increased 7%, with higher ASP per pair contributing approximately 1 percentage point of footwear revenue growth, primarily driven by higher full-price and off-price ASPs, partially offset by the impact of higher off-price sales.The currency-neutral increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2017 was fueled by growth in all key categories, led by Sportswear, Running and Training.
Unit sales of apparel increased 6%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 3 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP and, to a lesser extent, growth in our higher-priced NIKE Direct business.For fiscal 2017, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 28% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 26% for fiscal 2016.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased Demand creation expense by approximately 3 percentage points for fiscal 2018.Operating overhead expense increased 10% compared to fiscal 2017, due to higher administrative costs, continued investments in our growing NIKE Direct business and one-time wage-related costs associated with the Consumer Direct Offense organizational realignment.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased Operating overhead expense by approximately 2 percentage points for fiscal 2018.Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 Demand creation expense increased 2% for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, driven by higher sports marketing costs, as well as higher marketing and advertising costs, primarily to support key sporting events including the Rio Olympics and European Football Championship.
These increases were partially offset by lower retail brand presentation costs.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced Demand creation expense by approximately 1 percentage point.Operating overhead expense was flat compared to fiscal 2016 as continued investments in our growing NIKE Direct business were offset by administrative cost efficiencies and lower variable compensation.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced Operating overhead expense by approximately 1 percentage point for fiscal 2017.Other Expense (Income), Net(In millions) Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016Other expense (income), net $66 $(196) $(140)Other expense (income), net comprises foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies, and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as unusual or non-operating transactions outside the normal course of business.24Table of ContentsFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017 Other expense (income), net changed from $196 million of other income, net for fiscal 2017 to $66 million of other expense, net for fiscal 2018, primarily due to a $287 million net detrimental change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, including hedges.
We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other expense (income), net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $110 million for fiscal 2018.
Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 Other expense (income), net increased from $140 million of other income, net for fiscal 2016 to $196 million of other income, net for fiscal 2017, primarily due to a $56 million net beneficial change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses.We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other expense (income), net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $59 million for fiscal 2017.Income Taxes Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 % Change Fiscal 2016 % ChangeEffective tax rate 55.3% 13.2% 4,210 bps 18.7% (550) bpsFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017 Our effective tax rate was 55.3% for fiscal 2018, reflecting the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”).
The impact of the Tax Act primarily reflects provisional expense of $1,875 million for the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and $158 million resulting from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The remaining provisions of the Tax Act, which were a net benefit to the effective tax rate, did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements during fiscal 2018.
The increase in the effective tax rate resulting from the Tax Act was partially offset by the tax benefit from stock-based compensation in the current period as a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.Refer to Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the impact of ASU 2016-09, and Note 9 — Income Taxes for additional information on the impact of the Tax Act.Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 The 550 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily due to a one-time benefit in the first quarter of the fiscal year related to the resolution with the IRS of a foreign tax credit matter and a decrease in foreign earnings taxed in the United States.Operating SegmentsOur operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company’s internal organization.
The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity.
Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment.
The Company’s reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & Africa; Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America, and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands.
The Company’s NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment.
Converse is also a reportable segment for the Company and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories.As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and Converse.
These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established.
Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entity’s functional currency.
Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.25Table of ContentsThe breakdown of revenues is as follows:(Dollars in millions) Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017(1) % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes(2) Fiscal 2016(1) % Change % Change Excluding Currency Changes(2)North America $14,855 $15,216 -2 % -2 % $14,764 3% 3%Europe, Middle East & Africa 9,242 7,970 16 % 9 % 7,568 5% 10%Greater China 5,134 4,237 21 % 18 % 3,785 12% 17%Asia Pacific & Latin America 5,166 4,737 9 % 10 % 4,317 10% 13%Global Brand Divisions(3) 88 73 21 % 12 % 73 0% 2%TOTAL NIKE BRAND 34,485 32,233 7 % 5 % 30,507 6% 8%Converse 1,886 2,042 -8 % -11 % 1,955 4% 6%Corporate(4) 26 75 — — (86) — —TOTAL NIKE, INC.

Consumers are demanding a constant flow of fresh and innovative product, and have an expectation for superior service and real-time delivery, all fueled by the shift toward digital.
Specifically, in North America we anticipate continued evolution within the retail landscape, driven by shifting consumer traffic patterns across digital and physical channels.
The evolution of the North America marketplace has resulted in third-party retail store closures; however, we are currently seeing stabilization and momentum building in our business, fueled by innovative product and NIKE Brand consumer experiences, leveraging digital.Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017North America revenues decreased 2%, as growth in our Sportswear and NIKE Basketball categories was more than offset by declines in all other categories, most notably the Jordan Brand and Running.
NIKE Direct revenues increased 5% for fiscal 2018 due to digital commerce sales growth and the addition of new stores.Footwear revenues declined 4% for fiscal 2018, as lower revenues in nearly all categories, most notably the Jordan Brand, more than offset higher revenues in Sportswear.
Unit sales of footwear decreased 5%, while ASP per pair contributed approximately 1 percentage point of footwear growth, driven by the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business.Apparel revenue growth of 1% for fiscal 2018 was attributable to higher revenues in our Sportswear and NIKE Basketball categories, which was only partially offset by declines in nearly all other categories.
Unit sales of apparel decreased 4%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business and, to a lesser extent, higher full-price ASP and favorable changes in off-price sales.EBIT declined 7% for fiscal 2018, primarily reflecting lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense.
Gross margin declined 10 basis points as lower full-price ASP more than offset the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business.
Selling and administrative expense grew due to higher operating overhead expense resulting from continued investments in our growing NIKE Direct business.
Demand creation expense also increased, as higher sports marketing costs were only partially offset by lower retail brand presentation costs.Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 North America revenues increased 3%, driven by growth in our Sportswear and Jordan Brand categories, partially offset by declines in other categories, including NIKE Basketball.

Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars.Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options.
As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (“NTC”) and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures.
Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged.
Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons.
We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.32Table of ContentsRefer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded, as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.Transactional ExposuresWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk.
Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:•Product Costs — NIKE’s product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:1.Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:a.Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S.
Dollars.
The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies.
NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency result in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.b.Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S.
Dollars.
These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar decreases inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.2.Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories.
The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories’ foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures.
Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (“factory currency exposure index”) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input costs”) are denominated.For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party.
All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other expense (income), net.
Refer to Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases NIKE’s U.S. Dollar inventory cost.
Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.•Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales — A portion of our EMEA geography revenues, as well as a portion of our Converse European operations revenues, are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency.
These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.•Other Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent.
In certain cases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other expense (income), net.
Refer to Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.•Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies.
These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement which may create fluctuations in Other expense (income), net within our consolidated results of operations.Managing Transactional ExposuresTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program.
We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above.
Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with U.S. GAAP, except for hedges of the embedded derivatives components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements as discussed above.Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments under U.S. GAAP.
Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in Other expense (income), net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged.
33Table of ContentsTranslational ExposuresMany of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.
Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S.
Dollars for consolidated reporting.
The translation of foreign subsidiaries’ non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S.
Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income within the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity.
In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings.
The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a benefit of approximately $832 million and a detriment of approximately $542 million for the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a benefit of approximately $177 million and a detriment of approximately $115 million for the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Management generally identifies hyper-inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%.
Beginning in fiscal 2019, we anticipate the functional currency of our Argentina subsidiary within our APLA operating segment will change from the local currency to U.S.
Dollars as the subsidiary will be operating in a hyper-inflationary market.
As a result, its non-U.S. Dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities will now be subject to re-measurement and recorded in Other expense (income), net, within the Consolidated Statements of Income beginning in fiscal 2019.
Although we continue to evaluate the impact, at current rates, we do not anticipate the re-measurement to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.Managing Translational ExposuresTo minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S.
Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments.
The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated securities at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging.
We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments.
The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold.
Hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other expense (income), net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $110 million and $59 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Net Investments in Foreign SubsidiariesWe are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings.
We have, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments.
These hedges are accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2018 and 2017.
There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash Flow ActivityCash provided by operations was $4,955 million for fiscal 2018 compared to $3,846 million for fiscal 2017.
Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated $3,473 million of operating cash flow for fiscal 2018 compared to $4,781 million for fiscal 2017.
The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in an increase of $1,482 million for fiscal 2018, compared to a decrease of $935 million for fiscal 2017.
Impacting the change in working capital during fiscal 2018 was the accrual of $1,172 million for the transition tax under the Tax Act, which will be paid in cash over an eight-year period.
Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes for additional information on the Tax Act.
Cash provided by operations was also impacted by the change in Accounts Receivable, net, which decreased $187 million, primarily due to improved collection timing, compared to an increase of $426 million in fiscal 2017.Cash provided (used) by investing activities was an inflow of $276 million for fiscal 2018, compared to an outflow of $1,008 million for fiscal 2017, driven primarily by the net change in short-term investments.
During fiscal 2018, the net change in investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash inflow of $1,326 million compared to an inflow of $118 million in fiscal 2017.In fiscal 2019, we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, including corporate facilities, expanding our digital capabilities and new NIKE Direct stores.
We continue to expect such investments to approximate 3% to 4% of revenues, on average.Cash used by financing activities was $4,835 million for fiscal 2018 compared to $2,148 million for fiscal 2017.
The increase in Cash used by financing activities was primarily driven by $1,482 million of net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in fiscal 2017, which did not recur in fiscal 2018.
The increase in Cash used by financing activities was also impacted by increased repurchases of common stock, which resulted in a cash outflow of $4,254 million for fiscal 2018 compared to an outflow of $3,223 million for fiscal 2017.In fiscal 2018, we purchased 69.7 million shares of NIKE’s Class B Common Stock for $4,267 million (an average price of $61.25 per share) under the four-year, $12 billion program approved by the Board of Directors in November 2015.
As of May 31, 2018, we had repurchased 149.4 million shares at a cost of $8,704 million (an average price of $58.25 per share) under this program.
Although the timing and number of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions, we currently anticipate completing this program during fiscal 2019.
In June 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new four-year, $15 billion program to repurchase shares of NIKE’s Class B Common Stock, which we anticipate will commence at the completion of our current program.
We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows, excess cash and/or proceeds from debt.34Table of ContentsCapital ResourcesOn July 21, 2016, we filed a shelf registration statement (the “Shelf”) with the SEC which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time.
The Shelf expires on July 21, 2019.
For additional detail refer to Note 8 — Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.On August 28, 2015, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks, which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings.
The facility matures August 28, 2020, with a one-year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall it extend beyond August 28, 2022.
As of and for the periods ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no amounts outstanding under the committed credit facility.We currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively.
If our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase.
Conversely, if our long-term debt ratings were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease.
Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility.
Under this facility, we have agreed to various covenants.
These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth.
In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable.
As of May 31, 2018, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future.Liquidity is also provided by our $2 billion commercial paper program.
During the year ended May 31, 2018, the maximum amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at any point was $1.4 billion.
As of May 31, 2018, there were $325 million of outstanding borrowings under this program.
We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2019 depending on general corporate needs.
We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Moody’s Investor Services, respectively.To date, in fiscal 2018, we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs; however, future volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets.As of May 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $5.2 billion, primarily consisting of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities.
Our fixed-income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk.
All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk.
While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2018, the weighted-average days to maturity of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 33 days.We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsIn connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor.
Currently, we have several such agreements in place.
Based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations.35Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsOur significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2018, and significant endorsement contracts, including related marketing commitments, entered into through the date of this report are as follows:Description of Commitment Cash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31,(In millions) 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Thereafter TotalOperating Leases $589 $523 $472 $412 $361 $1,608 $3,965Capital Leases and Other Financing Obligations(1) 44 37 40 38 36 229 424Long-Term Debt(2) 115 115 112 109 609 4,713 5,773Endorsement Contracts(3) 1,391 1,306 1,158 1,266 942 4,438 10,501Product Purchase Obligations(4) 4,566 — — — — — 4,566Other Purchase Obligations(5) 1,437 512 281 92 70 254 2,646Transition Tax Related to the Tax Act(6) 94 94 94 94 94 702 1,172TOTAL $8,236 $2,587 $2,157 $2,011 $2,112 $11,944 $29,047(1)Capital leases and other financing obligations include payments related to build-to-suit lease arrangements.
(2)The cash payments due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments.
Estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts, applicable fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of May 31, 2018 (if variable), timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations.
(3)The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete, public figure, sport team and league endorsers of our products.
Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods.
Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods.In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use.
It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product.
The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives.
In addition, the costs to design, develop, source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers.
(4)We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our NIKE Direct in-line stores and digital commerce operations.
The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms.
In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process.
(5)Other purchase obligations primarily include construction, service and marketing commitments, including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts, made in the ordinary course of business.
The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases.
(6)Represents a provisional estimate of the future cash payments due as part of the transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which is reflected net of foreign tax credits we expect to utilize.
Actual amounts could vary as we complete our analysis of the Tax Act.
Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Financial Statements for additional information.In addition to the above, we have long-term obligations for uncertain tax positions and various post-retirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur.
Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes and Note 13 — Benefit Plans in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to uncertain tax positions and post-retirement benefits, respectively.
We also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2018.
Refer to Note 7 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below.

These letters of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the Company’s performance under certain self-insurance and other programs.New Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards.
36Table of ContentsCritical Accounting PoliciesOur previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.We believe the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.
Management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit & Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.These policies require we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date.
Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies.
Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.Revenue RecognitionWe record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale.
Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer.
Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and digital commerce revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer.In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer.
Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks.In certain countries, precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available.
In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location.
On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically.As part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded.
Our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date.
We base our estimates on (1) historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, (2) specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers.
Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates.
If actual or expected future returns, discounts and claims are significantly greater or lower than established reserves, we record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we make such determination.Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts ReceivableWe make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations.
Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates.
If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required.
In the event we determine a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to Operating overhead expense in the period in which such a determination is made.Inventory ReservesWe also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
If we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value.
This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales.
If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination.
Contingent Payments under Endorsement ContractsA significant amount of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts.
In general, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.
However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract.Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship).
We record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year).
When we determine payments are probable, the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorser’s performance.
In these instances, to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s performance, adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period.37Table of ContentsCertain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products.
We expense these payments in Cost of sales as the related sales occur.
In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments.
For contracts for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in Demand creation expense uniformly over the contract term.Property, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived AssetsWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable.
Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others.
If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group.
If the recoverability test indicates the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows.
Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value.Hedge Accounting for DerivativesWe use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities.
When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income, rather than Net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income.
In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Other comprehensive income into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative.
One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions.
By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions.
When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from Other comprehensive income to Other expense (income), net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs.Stock-based CompensationWe account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility.
Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors.
Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility.
If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.Income TaxesWe are subject to taxation in the United States, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions.
The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.
On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year.
This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date Income tax expense.
The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur.
As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year.
This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year.
When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs.We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary.
Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain.
At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income.
To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our Income tax expense in the period when such determination is made.On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity.
Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes.
We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense.On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Act, which significantly changes previous U.S. tax laws, including provisions for a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, as well as other changes.
In accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118 (“SAB 118”), we recorded provisional amounts, which represent reasonable estimates of the effects of the Tax Act for which the analysis is not yet complete.
As the Company completes its analysis of the Tax Act, including collecting, preparing and analyzing necessary information, performing and refining calculations and obtaining additional guidance from the U.S. Internal Revenue Services (IRS), U.S. Treasury Department, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or other standard setting and regulatory bodies on the Tax Act, it may record adjustments to the provisional amounts, which may be material.
In accordance with SAB 118, the Company’s accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act will be completed during the measurement period, which should not extend beyond one year from the enactment date.
Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.38Table of ContentsOther ContingenciesIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters.
We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable.
Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts.
Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain.
If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred.
In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability.
While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.39Table of ContentsITEM 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskIn the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates.
It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes.We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities.
Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated, but not yet firmly committed, transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions.
We have, in the past, and may in the future, also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries.
Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.The timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions.
Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs.
The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2018 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S.
Dollar, British Pound/Euro and Japanese Yen/U.S.
Dollar currency pairs.
Refer to Note 16 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates.
Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs.
To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and fixed-rate debt of varying maturities.Market Risk MeasurementWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk (“VaR”).
Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt.We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only.
The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments.
The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level.
There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation.
Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique).
These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one-year period.
The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate.
We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the underlying currency rate.
This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates.
It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur.
Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $93 million and $97 million at May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The VAR decreased year-over-year as a result of a decrease in foreign currency volatilities at May 31, 2018.
Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged.
The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $260 million and $161 million during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively.The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps.
Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation.
Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above.
Therefore, we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows.Details of third-party debt are provided in the table below.
