Item 7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal 2020 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on July 24, 2020.USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent revenues, currency-neutral revenues, Total NIKE Brand earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and Total NIKE, Inc. EBIT, as well as EBIT Margin and ROIC, which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.
GAAP”).
References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no NIKE Direct operations.
NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our NIKE Direct operations, which are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers.
Additionally, currency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends, excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
EBIT is calculated as Net Income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
EBIT Margin 2021 FORM 10-K 29 Table of Contentsis calculated as EBIT divided by total NIKE Inc.
Revenues.
ROIC represents a performance measure that management believes is useful information in understanding the Company's ability to effectively manage invested capital, see the table below for how the Company calculates this measure.Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the Company's performance, including when making financial and operating decisions.
Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends.
However, references to wholesale equivalent revenues, currency-neutral revenues, ROIC and EBIT should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.Our ROIC calculation as of May 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS ENDED(Dollars in millions)MAY 31, 2021MAY 31, 2020NumeratorNet income $5,727 $2,539 Add: Interest expense (income), net262 89 Add: Income tax expense934 348 Earnings before interest and taxes6,923 2,976 Income tax adjustment(1)(970)(352)Earnings before interest and after taxes$5,953 $2,624 AVERAGE FOR THE TRAILING FIVE QUARTERS ENDEDMAY 31, 2021MAY 31, 2020DenominatorTotal debt(2),(3)$12,890 $8,022 Add: Shareholders' equity10,523 8,938 Less: Cash and equivalents and Short-term investments11,217 4,756 Total invested capital$12,196 $12,204 RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL48.8 %21.5 %(1)Equals Earnings before interest and taxes multiplied by the effective tax rate as of the respective quarter end.

(2)Global Brand Divisions revenues include NIKE Brand licensing and other miscellaneous revenues that are not part of a geographic operating segment.
(3)Corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program.

Revenues increased 17% for fiscal 2021, driven by growth in both the NIKE Brand and Converse.
Higher revenues in North America contributed approximately 7 percentage points to NIKE, Inc.
Revenues, with EMEA and Greater China each contributing approximately 4 percentage points of growth and APLA and Converse each contributing approximately 1 percentage point of growth.On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear revenues increased 18% for fiscal 2021, driven by growth in nearly all key categories, primarily Sportswear and the Jordan Brand.
Unit sales of footwear increased 11%, while higher average selling price (ASP), on a wholesale equivalent basis, per pair contributed approximately 7 percentage points of footwear revenue growth.
The increase in ASP was primarily due to higher full-price ASP, in part reflecting lower discounts, as well as higher NIKE Direct ASP and the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business.Currency-neutral NIKE Brand apparel revenues increased 15% for fiscal 2021, due to growth in all key categories, primarily Sportswear, Football (Soccer) and the Jordan Brand.
Unit sales of apparel increased 14%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 1 percentage point of apparel revenue growth.
The increase in ASP was primarily due to the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business, as well as higher NIKE Direct ASP, partially offset by lower full-price ASP.On a reported basis, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 39% of our total NIKE Brand revenues for fiscal 2021 compared to 35% for fiscal 2020.
Digital commerce sales were $9.1 billion for fiscal 2021 compared to $5.5 billion for fiscal 2020.
On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 30% for fiscal 2021, driven by strong digital commerce sales growth of 60%, comparable store sales growth of 4% and the addition of new stores.
Comparable store sales, which exclude digital commerce sales, comprises revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year.
Comparable store sales includes revenues from stores that were temporarily closed during the period as a result of COVID-19.
Comparable store sales represents a performance measure that we believe is useful information for management and investors in understanding the performance of our established NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores.
Management considers this metric when making financial and operating decisions.
The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry.
As a result, our calculation of this metric may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.On a currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2021 NIKE Brand Men's and Women's revenues increased 11% and 20%, respectively.
Higher NIKE Brand Men's revenues were driven by growth in nearly all key categories, primarily Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Football (Soccer).
Higher NIKE Brand Women's revenues were driven by growth in all key categories, primarily Sportswear, the Jordan Brand, Training and Running.
Revenues for our NIKE Kids' business increased 15%, due to growth primarily in the Jordan Brand and Football (Soccer).2021 FORM 10-K 33 Table of ContentsGROSS MARGINFISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020For fiscal 2021, our consolidated gross profit increased 23% to $19,962 million compared to $16,241 million for fiscal 2020, as the prior fiscal year was significantly impacted by lower shipments to our wholesale customers and store closures within our NIKE Direct operations due to COVID-19.
Gross margin increased 140 basis points to 44.8% for fiscal 2021 compared to 43.4% for fiscal 2020 due to the following:*Wholesale equivalentFavorable NIKE Brand full-price product margins across both our wholesale and NIKE Direct businesses primarily reflect higher full-price ASP, net of discounts.
Additionally, the favorable impact of growth in our higher margin NIKE Direct business, led by NIKE owned Digital, was more than offset by higher promotions in our factory stores during the first half of fiscal 2021 to reduce excess inventory as a result of COVID-19.
Lower other costs are due to annualizing certain impacts of COVID-19 from fiscal 2020, including lower factory cancellation charges, lower inventory obsolescence reserves as well as the favorable rate impact of fixed supply chain costs on a higher volume of wholesale shipments.TOTAL SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2021FISCAL 2020% CHANGEFISCAL 2019% CHANGEDemand creation expense(1)$3,114 $3,592 -13 %$3,753 -4 %Operating overhead expense9,911 9,534 4 %8,949 7 %Total selling and administrative expense$13,025 $13,126 -1 %$12,702 3 %% of revenues29.2 %35.1 %(590) bps32.5 %260 bps(1)Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, complimentary product, television, digital and print advertising and media costs, brand events and retail brand presentation.FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020Demand creation expense decreased 13% for fiscal 2021, due to lower marketing and advertising expenses for our brand events and retail operations, as well as lower sports marketing expense as sporting events were postponed due to COVID-19.
This activity was partially offset by higher digital marketing investments.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased Demand creation expense by approximately 2 percentage points for fiscal 2021.Operating overhead expense increased 4% for fiscal 2021, due to an increase in strategic technology investments, higher NIKE Direct variable costs, and approximately $255 million in restructuring-related costs, partially offset by lower bad debt expense and lower travel and related expenses.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased Operating overhead expense by approximately 1 percentage point for fiscal 2021.OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2021FISCAL 2020FISCAL 2019Other (income) expense, net$14 $139 $(78)Other (income) expense, net comprises foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as unusual or non-operating transactions that are outside the normal course of business.2021 FORM 10-K 34Table of ContentsFISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020 Other (income) expense, net decreased from $139 million of other expense, net in fiscal 2020 to $14 million of other expense, net in the current year, primarily due to the non-recurring impairment charge of $405 million incurred in the prior year associated with our planned, strategic distributor partnership transition within APLA, partially offset by a $241 million net detrimental change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, including hedges.
For more information related to our distributor partnership transition within APLA, see Note 20 — Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses, and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had a favorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $19 million for fiscal 2021.

OPERATING SEGMENTSOur operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Company's internal organization.
The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity.
Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment.
The Company's reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA); Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America (APLA), and include results for the NIKE and Jordan brands, with results for the Hurley brand, prior to its divestiture in fiscal 2020, included in North America.
Refer to Note 20 — Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
The Company's NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment.
Converse is also a reportable operating segment for the Company and operates predominately in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of athletic lifestyle sneakers, apparel and accessories.As part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency exchange rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and Converse.
These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established.
Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entity's functional currency.
Differences between assigned standard foreign currency exchange rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.2021 FORM 10-K 35 Table of ContentsThe breakdown of Revenues is as follows:(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2021FISCAL 2020% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES(1)FISCAL 2019% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES(1)North America$17,179 $14,484 19 %19 %$15,902 -9 %-9 %Europe, Middle East & Africa11,456 9,347 23 %17 %9,812 -5 %-1 %Greater China8,290 6,679 24 %19 %6,208 8 %11 %Asia Pacific & Latin America(2)5,343 5,028 6 %8 %5,254 -4 %1 %Global Brand Divisions(3)25 30 -17 %-17 %42 -29 %-26 %TOTAL NIKE BRAND42,293 35,568 19 %17 %37,218 -4 %-2 %Converse2,205 1,846 19 %16 %1,906 -3 %-1 %Corporate(4)40 (11)— — (7)— — TOTAL NIKE, INC.

Corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program.The primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is EBIT, which represents Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Consumers are demanding a constant flow of fresh and innovative product, and have an expectation for superior service and rapid delivery, all fueled by the shift toward digital and mono-brand experiences in NIKE Direct.
We anticipate continued evolution within the retail landscape, driven by shifting consumer traffic patterns across digital and physical channels.
Specifically in North America, we remain focused on building long-term momentum with our strategic wholesale customers, which offer a differentiated retail experience.
Additionally, over the last three years we have significantly reduced the number of undifferentiated wholesale accounts.
During fiscal 2021, we took further steps towards account and channel consolidation by reprioritizing product allocation to benefit NIKE Direct and our differentiated strategic wholesale customers.
We expect that over the next two fiscal years, we will more aggressively accelerate these changes as we work to reprofile the shape of the marketplace and recapture wholesale revenue declines over time.FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020On a currency-neutral basis, North America revenues increased 19%, driven by growth in nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear and the Jordan Brand.
NIKE Direct revenues increased 37%, driven by strong digital sales growth of 73%, comparable store sales growth of 5% and the addition of new stores.Footwear revenues increased 25% on a currency-neutral basis due to higher revenues in several key categories, led by Sportswear and the Jordan Brand.
Unit sales of footwear increased 17%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 8 percentage points of footwear revenue growth.
Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher NIKE Direct and full-price ASPs, in part reflecting lower-discounts, as well as the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business.On a currency-neutral basis, apparel revenues increased 8% for fiscal 2021 driven by growth in all key categories, led by Sportswear.
Unit sales of apparel increased 8%, while ASP per unit was flat, as the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business was offset by lower full-price ASP.
Reported EBIT increased 76% driven by higher revenues, lower selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenues and gross margin expansion.
Gross margin increased approximately 430 basis points, primarily due to lower other costs, higher full-price ASP, reflecting lower discounts, the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business and lower product costs.
The decrease in other costs was primarily due to annualizing the impacts of COVID-19 from fiscal 2020, including lower factory cancellation charges, lower inventory obsolescence reserves and the favorable rate impact of fixed supply chain costs on a higher volume of wholesale shipments.
Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower operating overhead and demand creation expense.
Operating overhead expense decreased primarily as a result of lower bad debt and wage-related expenses, partially offset by higher NIKE Direct variable costs.
The decrease in demand creation expense was primarily due to lower advertising and marketing expense for brand events and our retail operations, as well as lower sports marketing expense, partially offset by continued investments in digital marketing to support heightened digital demand.2021 FORM 10-K 37 Table of ContentsEUROPE, MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2021FISCAL 2020% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGESFISCAL 2019% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGESRevenues by:Footwear$6,970 $5,892 18 %13 %$6,293 -6 %-3 %Apparel3,996 3,053 31 %25 %3,087 -1 %2 %Equipment490 402 22 %19 %432 -7 %-3 %TOTAL REVENUES$11,456 $9,347 23 %17 %$9,812 -5 %-1 %Revenues by: Sales to Wholesale Customers$7,812 $6,574 19 %14 %$7,076 -7 %-4 %Sales through NIKE Direct3,644 2,773 31 %25 %2,736 1 %5 %TOTAL REVENUES$11,456 $9,347 23 %17 %$9,812 -5 %-1 %EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES$2,435 $1,541 58 %$1,995 -23 % FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020 On a currency-neutral basis, EMEA revenues for fiscal 2021 grew 17%, driven by higher revenues across nearly all territories, led by UK & Ireland and Central Europe, which grew 34% and 20%, respectively.
Revenues increased in all key categories, led by Sportswear and the Jordan Brand.
NIKE Direct revenues increased 25%, driven by strong digital sales growth of 67%, partially offset by a 10% decline in comparable store sales, primarily due to reduced physical retail traffic, in part resulting from temporary store closures and safety-related measures in response to COVID-19.Currency-neutral footwear revenues increased 13%, driven by higher revenues in nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear and the Jordan Brand.
Unit sales of footwear increased 9% and higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 4 percentage points, resulting from higher full-price ASP and the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business.Currency-neutral apparel revenues increased 25% due to growth in all key categories, led by Sportswear and Football (Soccer).
Unit sales of apparel increased 26%, while lower ASP per unit reduced apparel revenues by approximately 1 percentage point.
Lower ASP per unit was primarily due to a lower mix of NIKE Direct sales, partially offset by higher full-price ASP, in part reflecting lower discounts.Reported EBIT increased 58% as higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expense more than offset a decline in gross margin.
Gross margin decreased approximately 110 basis points primarily due to lower NIKE Direct margins and unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, which more than offset lower product costs and lower other costs.
The decrease in other costs was primarily due to annualizing the impacts of COVID-19, including lower inventory obsolescence reserves, as well as the favorable rate impact of fixed supply chain costs on a higher volume of wholesale shipments.
Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower demand creation and operating overhead expense.
The decrease in demand creation expense was primarily driven by lower retail brand presentation costs and lower sports marketing expense.
Lower operating overhead expense was primarily due to lower bad debt and travel and related expenses, partially offset by higher NIKE Direct variable costs.2021 FORM 10-K 38Table of ContentsGREATER CHINA(Dollars in millions)FISCAL 2021FISCAL 2020% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGESFISCAL 2019% CHANGE% CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGESRevenues by:Footwear$5,748 $4,635 24 %19 %$4,262 9 %12 %Apparel2,347 1,896 24 %19 %1,808 5 %8 %Equipment195 148 32 %26 %138 7 %11 %TOTAL REVENUES$8,290 $6,679 24 %19 %$6,208 8 %11 %Revenues by: Sales to Wholesale Customers$4,513 $3,803 19 %14 %$3,726 2 %6 %Sales through NIKE Direct3,777 2,876 31 %26 %2,482 16 %20 %TOTAL REVENUES$8,290 $6,679 24 %19 %$6,208 8 %11 %EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES$3,243 $2,490 30 % $2,376 5 % FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020 On a currency-neutral basis, Greater China revenues for fiscal 2021 increased 19%, driven by higher revenues in all key categories, led by Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and NIKE Basketball.

For more information see Note 20 — Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020On a currency-neutral basis, APLA revenues increased 8% for fiscal 2021.
The increase was due to higher revenues across most territories, led by a 15% increase in Japan, a 37% increase in Pacific, which includes Australia and New Zealand, and a 12% increase in Korea, partially offset by a decline in Latin Distributors of 48%.
Additionally, the transition of our NIKE Brand business in Brazil to a third-party distributor operating model reduced APLA revenue growth by approximately 2 percentage points.
Revenues increased in most key categories, led by Sportswear and the Jordan Brand.
NIKE Direct revenues increased 22%, primarily fueled by strong digital sales growth of 73%, partially offset by comparable store sales declines of 4%, largely due to reduced physical retail traffic, in part resulting from safety-related measures in response to COVID-19.Currency-neutral footwear revenues increased 8% for fiscal 2021 due to higher revenues in several key categories, primarily the Jordan Brand and Sportswear.
Unit sales of footwear decreased 5%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 13 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven by higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs, in part reflecting inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory, which includes Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, as well as the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business.Currency-neutral apparel revenues increased 10% for fiscal 2021 due to higher revenues in most key categories, led by Sportswear.
Unit sales of apparel increased 5%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth.
Higher ASP per unit was primarily driven by higher full-price ASP, in part reflecting inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory.Reported EBIT increased 29% for fiscal 2021 driven by higher revenues, lower selling and administrative expense and gross margin expansion.
Gross margin increased approximately 130 basis points as higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, in part reflecting inflationary conditions in our SOCO territory, and lower other costs, were partially offset by higher product costs, unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and lower margin in our NIKE Direct business.
The decrease in other costs was primarily due to annualizing the impacts of COVID-19, including lower factory cancellation charges and lower inventory obsolescence reserves.

Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars.Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options.
As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (NTC) and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures.
Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged.
Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons.
We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.Refer to Note 6 — Fair Value Measurements and Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.2021 FORM 10-K 42Table of ContentsTRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURESWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk.
Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:•Product Costs — NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:1.Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:a.Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S.
Dollars.
The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies.
NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.b.Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S.
Dollars.
These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.2.Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories.
The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures.
Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (“factory currency exposure index”) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (“factory input costs”) are denominated.For the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party.
All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net.
Refer to Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE's U.S. Dollar inventory cost.
Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.•Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales — A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency.
These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.•Other Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent.
In certain cases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other (income) expense, net.
Refer to Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.•Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies.
These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURESTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program.
We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above.
Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges, except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements.2021 FORM 10-K 43 Table of ContentsCertain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement, and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments.
Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in Other (income) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged.
TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURESMany of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar.
Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S.
Dollars for consolidated reporting.
The translation of foreign subsidiaries' non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S.
Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Shareholders' equity.
In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings.
The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a benefit of approximately $893 million, a detriment of approximately $867 million and a detriment of approximately $1,236 million for the years ended May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a benefit of approximately $260 million, a detriment of approximately $212 million and a detriment of approximately $233 million for the years ended May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.Management generally identifies hyper-inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%.
Management has concluded our Argentina subsidiary within our APLA operating segment is operating in a hyper-inflationary market.
As a result, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the functional currency of our Argentina subsidiary changed from the local currency to the U.S. Dollar.
As of and for the period ended May 31, 2021, this change did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition and we do not anticipate it will have a material impact in future periods based on current rates.MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURESTo minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S.
Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments.
The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated investments at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.
We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments.
The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold.
Hedges of the purchase of U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had a favorable impact of approximately $19 million and unfavorable impacts of $91 million and $97 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIESWe are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings.
We have, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments.
These hedges are accounted for as net investment hedges in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2021 and 2020.
There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.2021 FORM 10-K 44Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCASH FLOW ACTIVITYCash provided (used) by operations was an inflow of $6,657 million for fiscal 2021 compared to $2,485 million for fiscal 2020.
Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated $6,612 million of operating cash inflow for fiscal 2021 compared to $3,730 million for fiscal 2020.
The increase primarily reflects the recovery of our business operations from the impact of COVID-19.
The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in an increase to Cash provided (used) by operations of $45 million for fiscal 2021, compared to a decrease of $1,245 million for fiscal 2020.
The net change in working capital was impacted by a $2,361 million decrease in Inventories, driven by strong consumer demand as we return to healthy inventory levels across markets closed in the prior year due to COVID-19.
An increase in Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities also contributed to the net change in working capital, primarily due to reduced spending in fiscal 2020 as a result of COVID-19.
In addition, the net change in working capital was impacted by a $2,845 million increase in Accounts receivable, net, primarily driven by higher revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.Cash provided (used) by investing activities was an outflow of $3,800 million for fiscal 2021, compared to an outflow of $1,028 million for fiscal 2020, primarily driven by higher purchases of short-term investments.
During fiscal 2021, the net change in investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash outflow of $3,276 million compared to a cash inflow of $27 million in fiscal 2020.
Additionally, during fiscal 2021, we continued investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, specifically focused around digital capabilities, our end-to-end technology foundation, our corporate facilities and improvements across our supply chain.
In future periods, we expect to make annual capital expenditures of approximately 3% of annual revenues.Cash provided (used) by financing activities was an outflow of $1,459 million for fiscal 2021 compared to an inflow of $2,491 million for fiscal 2020.
This change was primarily due to the net proceeds from a $5,942 million corporate bond issuance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, partially offset by lower share repurchases during fiscal 2021.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, to enhance our liquidity position in response to COVID-19, we elected to temporarily suspend share repurchases under our existing share repurchase program.
The existing program remained authorized by the Board of Directors and during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we began repurchasing shares under the program.
In fiscal 2021, we purchased 4.9 million shares of NIKE's Class B Common Stock for $650 million (an average price of $133.54 per share) under the four-year, $15 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2018.
As of May 31, 2021, we had repurchased 50.0 million shares at a cost of $4,669 million (an average price of $93.33 per share) under this program.
We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows and excess cash.
The timing and the amount of share repurchases will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions.
CAPITAL RESOURCESOn July 23, 2019, we filed a shelf registration statement (the “Shelf”) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time.
The Shelf expires on July 23, 2022.
On August 16, 2019, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings, with the option to increase borrowings up to $3 billion in total upon lender approval.
The facility matures on August 16, 2024, with a one-year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall the facility extend beyond August 16, 2026.
This facility replaces the prior $2 billion credit facility agreement entered into on August 28, 2015, which would have matured August 28, 2020.
On March 15, 2021, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings, with the option to increase borrowings up to $1.5 billion in total upon lender approval.
The facility matures on March 14, 2022, with a 364-day extension option up to 30 days prior to the existing termination date, provided that in no event shall the facility extend beyond March 13, 2023.
This facility replaces the prior $2 billion credit facility agreement entered into on April 6, 2020, which would have matured on April 5, 2021.
As of May 31, 2021 and 2020, no amounts were outstanding under our committed credit facilities.
Refer to Note 7 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines for additional information.We currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.
As it relates to our committed credit facilities entered into on August 16, 2019 and March 15, 2021, if our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fees and interest rates would increase.
Conversely, if our long-term debt ratings were to improve, the facility fees and interest rates would decrease.
Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities.
Under these facilities, we have agreed to various covenants.
These covenants include limits on our disposal of assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur.
In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under these facilities, failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become 2021 FORM 10-K 45 Table of Contentsimmediately due and payable.
As of May 31, 2021, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future.Liquidity was also provided by our $3 billion commercial paper program, which we decreased from $4 billion in connection with the new credit facility agreement, entered into on March 15, 2021, as described above.
During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, the maximum amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at any point was $248 million.
No commercial paper was outstanding as of May 31, 2021.
As of May 31, 2020, we had $248 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 1.65%.We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities depending on general corporate needs.
We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.To date, we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets; however, future volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets.As of May 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $13.5 billion, primarily consisting of commercial paper, corporate notes, deposits held at major banks, money market funds, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations, U.S. Treasury obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities.
Our fixed-income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk.
All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk.
While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2021, the weighted-average days to maturity of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 54 days.We believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future.We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed.
We indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings.
Should we require additional capital in the United States, we may determine to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the United States through debt.
Given our existing structure, if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings, we would be required to accrue and pay withholding taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions.OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTSIn connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor.
Currently, we have several such agreements in place.
Based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONSOur significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2021, and significant endorsement contracts, including related marketing commitments, entered into through the date of this report are as follows:DESCRIPTION OF COMMITMENTCASH PAYMENTS DUE DURING THE YEAR ENDING MAY 31,(Dollars in millions)20222023202420252026THEREAFTERTOTALOperating Leases$534 $530 $490 $437 $357 $1,397 $3,745 Long-Term Debt(1)286 786 275 1,275 251 11,290 14,163 Endorsement Contracts(2)1,502 1,244 1,091 966 726 2,863 8,392 Product Purchase Obligations(3)6,448 — — — — — 6,448 Other Purchase Obligations(4)1,347 541 331 191 96 230 2,736 Transition Tax Related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act(5)86 86 161 215 268 — 816 TOTAL$10,203 $3,187 $2,348 $3,084 $1,698 $15,780 $36,300 (1)The cash payments due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments.
Estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts, applicable fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of May 31, 2021 (if variable), timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations.
(2)The amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete, public figure, sport team and league endorsers of our products.
Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods.
Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods.2021 FORM 10-K 46Table of ContentsIn addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use.
It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product.
The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives.
In addition, the costs to design, develop, source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers.
(3)We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our direct to consumer operations.
The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms.
In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process.
(4)Other purchase obligations primarily include construction, service and marketing commitments, including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts, made in the ordinary course of business.
The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, and may include open purchase orders for non-product purchases.
(5)Represents the future cash payments due as part of the transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which is reflected net of foreign tax credits we utilized.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRefer to Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting standards.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESOur previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.We believe the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.
Management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit & Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.These policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements as of a given date.
Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies.
Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.REVENUE RECOGNITIONBeginning in fiscal 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
Our revenue recognition policies under Topic 606 are described in the following paragraphs.Revenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as Converse products, comprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels.
We satisfy the performance obligation and record revenues when transfer of control to the customer has occurred, based on the terms of sale.
A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive 2021 FORM 10-K 47 Table of Contentssubstantially all of the benefits of the product.
Control is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer.
Control transfers to retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment.
The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers.
Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer.
Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions.As part of our revenue recognition policy, consideration promised in our contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions, such as sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers.
We estimate the most likely amount we will be entitled to receive and record an anticipated reduction against Revenues, with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized.
The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.The provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns.
Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date.Estimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers and outstanding discounts and claims and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers.
Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and may differ from estimates recorded.
If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claims were significantly different than reserves established, a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made.Refer also to Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 16 — Revenues for additional information in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
INVENTORY RESERVESWe make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
If we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value.
This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales.
If changes in market conditions result in reductions to the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination.
CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTSA significant amount of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts.
In general, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.
However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract.Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship).
We record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year).
When we determine payments are probable, the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorser's performance.
In these instances, to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser's performance, adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period.Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products, which we record in Cost of sales as the related sales occur.
For contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments, we record the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product within Demand creation expense.PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEFINITE-LIVED ASSETSWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable.
Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others.
If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset 2021 FORM 10-K 48Table of Contentsgroup by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group.
If the recoverability test indicates the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows.
Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group's carrying amount and its estimated fair value.HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVESWe use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities.
When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), rather than Net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income.
In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative.
One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of the designated amount of anticipated transactions.
By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions.
When the designated amount of anticipated or actual transactions decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs.
In rare circumstances, the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside our control or influence.INCOME TAXESWe are subject to taxation in the United States, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions.
The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.
On an interim basis, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year.
This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date Income tax expense.
The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur.
As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year.
This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year.
When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs.We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary.
Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain.
At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income.
To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our Income tax expense in the period when such determination is made.We have not recorded withholding tax expense for foreign earnings we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested within certain of our foreign jurisdictions.
The amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore is due to the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore operations and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S. and foreign entities.
Withholding tax consequences are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore.We carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation.
Despite this approach, because the determination is based on expected working capital and other capital needs in jurisdictions where the earnings are generated, the possibility exists that foreign earnings declared as indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated.
For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. operations may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations.
This would result in additional withholding tax expense in the year we determined amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore.On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity.
Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes.
We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense.
Refer to Note 9 — Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.2021 FORM 10-K 49 Table of ContentsOTHER CONTINGENCIESIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters.
We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable.
Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts.
Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain.
If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred.
In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability.
While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.2021 FORM 10-K 50Table of ContentsITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKIn the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates.
It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes.We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities.
Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated, but not yet firmly committed, transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions.
We have, in the past, and may in the future, also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries.
Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.The timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions.
Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs.
The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2021, are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S.
Dollar, British Pound/Euro, Chinese Yuan/U.S.
Dollar and Japanese Yen/U.S.
Dollar currency pairs.
Refer to Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates.
Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs.
To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and fixed-rate debt of varying maturities.MARKET RISK MEASUREMENTWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk (“VaR”).
Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies and fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt.We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only.
The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments.
The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level.
There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation.
Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique).
These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one-year period.
The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate.
We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma”) to changes in the underlying currency rate.
This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates.
It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur.
Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $92 million and $48 million as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The VaR increased year-over-year as a result of an increase in foreign currency volatilities as of May 31, 2021.
Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged.
The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $184 million and $126 million during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively.2021 FORM 10-K 51 Table of ContentsThe instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies and fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt.
Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation.
Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above.
Therefore, we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Details of third-party debt are provided in the table below.
The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates.
