ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IntroductionThis MD&A is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our recent performance, financial condition and prospects.
This discussion and analysis compares 2019 results to 2018.
For a discussion that compares our 2018 results to 2017, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The reference to "N.M." indicates that the calculation is not meaningful.
In addition, we provide commentary regarding organic sales growth, which describes the impact of changes in volume, product mix and net selling prices on net sales.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and exited businesses also impact the year-over-year change in net sales.
Dollar amounts are reported in millions, except per share dollar amounts, unless otherwise noted.
The following will be discussed and analyzed:•Overview of Business•Overview of 2019 Results•Results of Operations and Related Information•Unaudited Quarterly Data•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates•Legal Matters•New Accounting Standards•Information Concerning Forward-Looking StatementsThroughout this MD&A, we refer to financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP, and are therefore referred to as non-GAAP financial measures.
These measures include adjusted gross and operating profit, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted other (income) and expense, net, and adjusted effective tax rate.
We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the financial measures used to evaluate management.
Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures, and they should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
There are limitations to these non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in methods of calculation and items being excluded.
We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as a supplement to the GAAP measures and by providing reconciliations of the non-GAAP and comparable GAAP financial measures.
The non-GAAP financial measures exclude the following items for the relevant time periods as indicated in the reconciliations included later in this MD&A:•2018 Global Restructuring Program - In 2018, we initiated a restructuring program to reduce our structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization.
See Item 8, Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for details.•Property Sale Gain - In the fourth quarter of 2019, we recognized a gain on the sale of property associated with a former manufacturing facility that was closed in 2012 as part of a past restructuring.•U.S.
Tax Reform Related Matters - In 2018 we recognized a net charge associated with U.S. tax reform related matters.
See Item 8, Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for details.

Although we are primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations, based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows, we believe exposure to losses, if any, under these arrangements is not material.•The open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts for goods and services we have negotiated for delivery.The table does not include amounts where payments are discretionary or the timing is uncertain.
The following payments are not included in the table:•We will fund our defined benefit pension plans to meet or exceed statutory requirements and currently expect to contribute approximately $50 to these plans in 2020.
•Other postretirement benefit payments are estimated using actuarial assumptions, including expected future service, to project the future obligations.
Based upon those projections, we anticipate making annual payments for these obligations of approximately $60 through 2029.•Accrued income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, deferred taxes and noncontrolling interests.
18KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION - 2019 Annual ReportInvestingOur capital spending was $1.2 billion in 2019 and $0.9 billion 2018, reflecting incremental spending in 2019 related to the 2018 Global Restructuring Program.
Proceeds from dispositions of property in 2019 of $242 primarily reflects the proceeds from the sales of manufacturing facilities and associated real estate related to the 2018 Global Restructuring Program and property associated with a former manufacturing facility that was closed as part of a past restructuring.
We expect capital spending to be approximately $1.15 billion to $1.35 billion in 2020, including significant spending associated with the 2018 Global Restructuring Program.
FinancingWe issue long-term debt in the public market periodically.
Proceeds from the offerings are used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of maturing debt or outstanding commercial paper indebtedness.
See Item 8, Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for details.Our short-term debt, which consists of U.S. commercial paper with original maturities up to 90 days and/or other similar short-term debt issued by non-U.S. subsidiaries, was $775 as of December 31, 2019 (included in debt payable within one year on the consolidated balance sheet).
The average month-end balance of short-term debt for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was $1.0 billion.
These short-term borrowings provide supplemental funding for supporting our operations.
The level of short-term debt generally fluctuates depending upon the amount of operating cash flows and the timing of customer receipts and payments for items such as pension contributions, dividends and income taxes.At December 31, 2019, total debt was $7.7 billion compared to $7.5 billion at December 31, 2018.
In February 2020, we issued $500 aggregate principal amount of 2.875% notes due February 7, 2050.
Proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of a portion of our commercial paper indebtedness.We maintain a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility which expires in June 2023 and a $750 revolving credit facility which expires in June 2020.
These facilities, currently unused, support our commercial paper program, and would provide liquidity in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is unavailable for any reason.We paid $1.4 billion in dividends in 2019.
The Board of Directors approved a dividend increase of 3.9 percent for 2020.
We repurchase shares of Kimberly-Clark common stock from time to time pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs.
During 2019, we repurchased 6.2 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $800 through a broker in the open market.
We are targeting full-year 2020 share repurchases between $700 and $900, subject to market conditions.We believe that our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue short-term and long-term debt are adequate to fund working capital, payments for our 2018 Global Restructuring Program, capital spending, pension contributions, dividends and other needs for the foreseeable future.
Further, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations for the foreseeable future.
19KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION - 2019 Annual ReportCritical Accounting Policies and Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period.
The critical accounting policies we used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used.
The critical judgments by management relate to accruals for sales incentives and trade promotion allowances, pension and other postretirement benefits, deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments.
These critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.Sales Incentives and Trade Promotion AllowancesTrade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees, cooperative marketing programs, temporary price reductions and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products.
Rebate and promotion accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales.
Promotion accruals also consider estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and timing and costs of activities within the promotional programs.
Generally, the estimated redemption value of consumer coupons and related expense are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption, influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories, and the cost is recorded when the related revenue from customers is realized.
Our related accounting policies are discussed in Item 8, Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.Employee Postretirement BenefitsSubstantially all regular employees in the U.S. and the United Kingdom are covered by defined contribution retirement plans and certain U.S. and United Kingdom employees previously earned benefits covered by defined benefit pension plans that currently provide no future service benefit (the "Principal Plans").
Certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or, in certain countries, termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees.
Our related accounting policies and account balances are discussed in Item 8, Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.Changes in certain assumptions could affect pension expense and the benefit obligations, particularly the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate the obligations:•Long-term rate of return on plan assets.
The expected long-term rate of return is evaluated on an annual basis.
In setting these assumptions, we consider a number of factors including projected future returns by asset class relative to the target asset allocation.
Actual asset allocations are regularly reviewed and they are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocations when considered appropriate.
As of December 31, 2019, the Principal Plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately $1.2 billion.
These unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by (i) actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns, (ii) other factors, including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations, or (iii) other actuarial gains, and whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the "corridor" as required.
If the expected long-term rate of return on assets for the Principal Plans were lowered by 0.25 percent, the impact on annual pension expense would not be material in 2020.•Discount rate.
The discount (or settlement) rate used to determine the present value of our future U.S. pension obligation at December 31, 2019 was based on a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with cash flows that largely match the expected benefit payments of the plan.
For the United Kingdom plan, the discount rate was determined based on yield curves constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities.
Each year's expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate to determine the pension obligations.
If the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, the increase in annual pension expense would not be material in 2020, and the December 31, 2019 pension liability would increase by about $130.•Other assumptions.
There are a number of other assumptions involved in the calculation of pension expense and benefit obligations, primarily related to participant demographics and benefit elections.
Pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate $105 in 2020, including incremental charges resulting from 2018 Global Restructuring Program actions.
Pension expense beyond 2020 will depend on future investment performance, 20KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION - 2019 Annual Reportour contributions to the pension trusts, changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered participants in the plans.Substantially all U.S. retirees and employees have access to our unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans.
Changes in significant assumptions could affect the consolidated expense and benefit obligations, particularly the discount rate used to calculate the obligations and the health care cost trend rate:•Discount rate.
The determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans is discussed in the pension benefit section above, and the methodology for each country is the same as the methodology used to determine the discount rate for that country's pension obligation.
If the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, the impact to 2020 other postretirement benefit expense and the increase in the December 31, 2019 benefit liability would not be material.
•Health care cost trend rate.
The health care cost trend rate is based on a combination of inputs including our recent claims history and insights from external advisers regarding recent developments in the health care marketplace, as well as projections of future trends in the marketplace.Deferred Income Taxes and Potential AssessmentsAs a global organization, we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the U.S. and internationally.
Changes in certain assumptions related to income taxes could significantly affect consolidated results, particularly with regard to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside the U.S. and uncertain tax positions.
Our income tax related accounting policies, account balances and matters affecting income taxes are discussed in Item 8, Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
•Deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances.
We have recorded deferred tax assets related to, among other matters, income tax loss carryforwards, income tax credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards and have established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets.
These carryforwards are primarily in non-U.S. taxing jurisdictions and in certain states in the U.S. Foreign tax credits earned in the U.S. in current and prior years, which cannot be used currently, also give rise to net deferred tax assets.
In determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets, many factors are considered, including the specific taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward period, income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction.
A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.•Undistributed earnings.
As of December 31, 2019, we have accumulated undistributed earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries of approximately $7.7 billion.
Earnings of $5.6 billion were previously subject to tax, primarily due to the one-time transition tax on foreign earnings required by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Any additional taxes due with respect to such previously-taxed earnings, if repatriated, would generally be limited to foreign and U.S. state income taxes.
Deferred taxes have been recorded on $0.9 billion of earnings, most of which were previously taxed for U.S. federal income tax purposes, of foreign consolidated subsidiaries expected to be repatriated.
We do not intend to distribute the remaining $4.7 billion of previously taxed foreign earnings and therefore have not recorded deferred taxes for foreign and U.S. state income taxes on such earnings.
While the transition tax resulted in a reduction of the excess amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries, any remaining amount of financial reporting over tax basis after such reduction could be subject to additional taxes, if repatriated.
However, we consider any excess to be indefinitely reinvested.
The determination of deferred tax liabilities on the amount of financial reporting over tax basis or the $4.7 billion of previously taxed foreign earnings is not practicable.•Uncertain tax positions.
We record our global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which we operate.
Where we believe that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in our income tax returns.
Where treatment of a position is uncertain, a liability is recorded based upon the expected most likely outcome taking into consideration the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter.
These liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities or the expiration of the statute of limitations.
Legal MattersSee Item 8, Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information on legal matters.
21KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION - 2019 Annual ReportNew Accounting StandardsSee Item 8, Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting standards and their anticipated effects on our consolidated financial statements.Information Concerning Forward-Looking StatementsCertain matters contained in this report concerning the business outlook, including the anticipated cost savings from our FORCE program, costs and savings from the 2018 Global Restructuring Program, cash flow and uses of cash, growth initiatives, innovations, marketing and other spending, net sales, anticipated currency rates and exchange risks, including the impact in Argentina, raw material, energy and other input costs, effective tax rate, contingencies and anticipated transactions of Kimberly-Clark, including dividends, share repurchases and pension contributions, constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based upon management's expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting Kimberly-Clark.
There can be no assurance that these future events will occur as anticipated or that our results will be as estimated.
Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update them.
The assumptions used as a basis for the forward-looking statements include many estimates that, among other things, depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases.
In addition, many factors outside our control, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the prices and availability of our raw materials, potential competitive pressures on selling prices for our products, energy costs, our ability to maintain key customer relationships and retail trade customer actions, as well as general economic and political conditions globally and in the markets in which we do business, could affect the realization of these estimates.The factors described under Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in this Form 10-K, or in our other SEC filings, among others, could cause our future results to differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.
Other factors not presently known to us or that we presently consider immaterial could also affect our business operations and financial results.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.
A variety of practices are employed to manage these risks, including operating and financing activities and, where deemed appropriate, the use of derivative instruments.
Derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation.
Foreign currency derivative instruments are primarily entered into with major financial institutions.
Our credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date.
Credit risk with respect to the counterparties is actively monitored but is not considered significant since these transactions are executed with a diversified group of financial institutions.Presented below is a description of our risks (foreign currency risk and interest rate risk) together with a sensitivity analysis, performed annually, of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices.
These analyses reflect management's view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a one-year period.
Also included is a description of our commodity price risk.Foreign Currency Risk A portion of our foreign currency risk is managed through the systematic use of foreign currency forward contracts.
The use of these instruments supports the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset, in whole or in part, gains or losses on the underlying foreign currency exposure.
We also utilize cross currency swaps and foreign denominated debt to hedge certain investments in foreign subsidiaries.
The gain or loss on these instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income to offset the change in value of the net investments being hedged.Foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
An annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on our foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures at the current year-end.
The balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliate's net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar.
22KIMBERLY-CLARK CORPORATION - 2019 Annual ReportAs of December 31, 2019, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would not be material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
This hypothetical loss on transactional exposures is based on the difference between the December 31, 2019 rates and the assumed rates.
Our operations in Argentina are reported using highly inflationary accounting and their functional currency is the U.S. dollar.
Changes in the value of an Argentine peso versus the U.S. dollar applied to our net peso monetary position are recorded in Other (income) and expense, net at the time of the change.
As of December 31, 2019, K-C Argentina had a small net peso monetary position and a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate would not be material.The translation of the balance sheets of non-U.S. operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Consequently, an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of non-U.S. operations into U.S. dollars.
These translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments ("UTA") within stockholders' equity.
The hypothetical change in UTA is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non-U.S. operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates.
As of December 31, 2019, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders' equity by approximately $550.
In the view of management, the above potential UTA adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position because they would not affect our cash flow.Interest Rate RiskInterest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixed-rate debt composed of short and long-term instruments.
The objective is to maintain a cost-effective mix that management deems appropriate.
At December 31, 2019, the long-term debt portfolio was comprised of primarily fixed-rate debt.
From time to time, we also hedge the anticipated issuance of fixed-rate debt and those contracts are designated as cash flow hedges.In order to determine the impact of changes in interest rates on our financial position or future results of operations, we calculated the increase or decrease in the market value of fixed-rate debt using a 10 percent change in current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments.
At December 31, 2019, a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixed-rate debt by about $210, which would not have a significant impact on our financial statements as we do not record debt at fair value.
Commodity Price RiskWe are subject to commodity price risk, the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp.
Selling prices of tissue products are influenced, in part, by the market price for pulp.
As previously discussed under Item 1A, "Risk Factors," increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices.
In some instances, we utilize negotiated short-term contract structures, including fixed price contracts, to manage volatility for a portion of our commodity costs, but derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks.Our energy, manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions.
As previously discussed under Item 1A, "Risk Factors," there can be no assurance we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources.
In addition, we are subject to price risk for utilities and manufacturing inputs, used in our manufacturing operations.
Derivative instruments are used in accordance with our risk management policy to hedge a limited portion of the price risk.
