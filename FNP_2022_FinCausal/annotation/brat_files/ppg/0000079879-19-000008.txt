and Canada net sales increased a low-single-digit percentage primarily driven by net sales from acquired businesses which added approximately $110 million, primarily from The Crown Group, as well as higher selling prices in most businesses.
Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) net sales increased a mid-single-digit percentage, led by slightly positive sales volumes, higher selling prices in all businesses and favorable foreign currency translation driven by the euro and U.K. pound.
Asia Pacific net sales increased by a mid-single-digit percentage aided by higher selling prices in most businesses and higher sales volumes, slightly offset by weakening industry demand in China later in the year.
Sales growth was also supported by a more than 10% increase in India and solid gains in Australia and Southeast Asia.
Net sales in this region also benefited from favorable foreign currency translation.
Latin American net sales volumes grew by a mid-single-digit percentage versus the prior year.
Sales also benefited from higher selling prices in the region, offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation driven by the Mexican peso.
For specific business results see the Segment Results section within Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 2017 vs. 2016Net sales increased $478 million due to the following:● Acquisition-related sales (+1%)● Higher sales volumes (+1%)● Slightly favorable foreign currency translation● Slightly higher selling pricesNet sales from acquired businesses added over $200 million of sales in 2017, primarily MetoKote, DEUTEK, Univer and The Crown Group.U.S.
and Canada sales volumes declined slightly year-over-year, with mixed demand by business and end-use segment.
Sales volumes in architectural coatings U.S. company-owned stores grew by a mid-single-digit percentage, but were more than offset by sales volumes declines in the independent dealer networks and national retail (DIY) customer accounts in aggregate.
Automotive OEM coatings sales volumes declined year-over-year and lagged industry demand levels due to a customer-driven share shift away from PPG that was offset in other regions of the world.
These decreases in sales volumes were partially offset by higher sales volumes in specialty coatings and materials, automotive refinish coatings, general industrial coatings, aerospace coatings and packaging coatings.EMEA sales volumes increased a low-single-digit percentage versus the prior year.
Sales volumes in our automotive OEM coatings and aerospace coatings businesses each grew by a mid-single-digit percentage.
Specialty coatings and materials sales volumes grew by a double-digit percentage, driven by strong silica demand.
Protective coatings volumes also grew year-over-year.
These increases in sales volumes were partially offset by lower demand in architectural coatings.28 2018 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-KAsia Pacific sales volumes expanded by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year led by growth in each business within the Industrial Coatings segment along with sales volume growth in the architectural coatings business.
These increases in sales volumes were partially offset by lower demand in marine coatings year-over-year.
From a country and sub-region perspective, sales volumes grew in India, China, and Southeast Asia versus the prior year.
Korea sales volumes continued to decline year-over-year primarily due to continued weakness in new shipbuilding.Latin America sales volumes expanded by a mid-single-digit percentage versus the prior year primarily due to above market growth in our automotive OEM coatings and general industrial coatings businesses.
The automotive OEM coatings growth was driven by industry production expansion with the opening of new assembly facilities in Mexico.
Regional sales volumes were lower in architectural coatings versus the prior year primarily due to lower sales volumes in Brazil and in Mexico due to the impact of the natural disasters during the third quarter.Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization % Change($ in millions, except percentages)2018201720162018 vs. 20172017 vs. 2016Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization$9,001$8,209$7,6659.6%7.1%Cost of sales as a % of net sales58.5%55.7%53.7%2.8%2.0%2018 vs. 2017Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased $792 million due to the following:● Raw material cost inflation● Higher sales volumes● Cost reclassifications associated with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.

Business restructuring, netA pretax restructuring charge of $83 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2018, offset by certain changes in estimates to complete previously recorded programs of $17 million.
A pretax charge of $191 million was recorded in 2016.
Refer to Note 8, "Business Restructuring" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Pension settlement chargesDuring 2017, PPG made lump-sum payments to certain retirees who had participated in PPG's U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans totaling approximately $127 million.
As the lump-sum payments were in excess of the expected 2017 service and interest costs for the affected plans, PPG remeasured the periodic benefit obligation of these plans in the period payments were made and recorded settlement charges totaling $60 million ($38 million after-tax) during 2017.
During 2016, PPG permanently transferred approximately $1.8 billion of its U.S. and Canadian pension obligations and assets to several highly rated insurance companies.
These actions triggered remeasurement and partial settlement of certain of the Company’s defined benefit pension plans.
PPG recognized a $968 million pre-tax settlement charge in connection with these transactions.
Refer to Note 13, "Employee Benefit Plans" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Other chargesOther charges in 2018 and 2016 were higher than 2017 primarily due to environmental remediation charges.
These charges were principally for environmental remediation at a former chromium manufacturing plant and associated sites in New Jersey.
Refer to Note 14, "Commitments and Contingent Liabilities" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.Other incomeOther income was lower in 2018 and 2016 than in 2017 primarily due to the gain from the sale of the Mexican Plaka business of $25 million and income from a legal settlement of $18 million in 2017.

In 2017, the tax rate included the tax toll charge for unremitted foreign earnings under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, while in 2018, the tax rate benefited from prior period adjustments, including finalization of the provisional toll charge recorded in 2017.
The 2019 effective tax rate from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of 23% to 25%.
As reported, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased year-over-year.
Refer to the Regulation G Reconciliations - Results of Operations for additional information.
The Company’s earnings per diluted share and adjusted earnings per diluted share benefited from the 15.9 million, 7.4 million and 10.7 million shares of stock repurchased in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, in conjunction with the Company’s cash deployment objectives.
Regulation G Reconciliations - Results of OperationsPPG Industries believes investors’ understanding of the Company’s operating performance is enhanced by the disclosure of net income, earnings per diluted share and the effective tax rate adjusted for certain charges.
PPG’s management considers this information useful in providing insight into the Company’s ongoing operating performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on a quarterly basis or that are not attributable to our primary operations.
Net income and earnings per diluted share adjusted for these items are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered a substitute for net income or earnings per diluted share or other financial measures as computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
In addition, adjusted net income, earnings per diluted share and the effective tax rate may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies.
Income before income taxes from continuing operations is reconciled to adjusted income before income taxes, the effective tax rate from continuing operations is reconciled to the adjusted effective tax rate from continuing operations and net income (attributable to PPG) and earnings per share – assuming dilution (attributable to PPG) are reconciled to adjusted net income (attributable to PPG) and adjusted earnings per share – assuming dilution below:Year-ended December 31, 2018

Sales volumes were positive year-over-year in the U.S. and Canada company-owned store network as well as in Mexico, Central America, Australia and Brazil.
This growth was more than offset by lower DIY and independent dealer network channel declines, including the unfavorable impact from a customer assortment change in the U.S. architectural DIY channel.
In February 2018, PPG announced that Lowe’s would discontinue the sale of OLYMPIC® brand paints and stains in its U.S. retail stores, effective mid-2018.
During the second quarter 2018, the Company launched its OLYMPIC® stain products at THE HOME DEPOT®’s U.S. retail stores, expanding an existing partnership arrangement.
The net impact of these customer assortment changes resulted in net sales being lower by approximately $100 million in 2018.Architectural coatings - EMEA net sales grew by a mid-single digit percentage.
Higher selling prices and acquisition-related sales more than offset modestly lower sales volumes.
Sales volumes grew in countries in Northern and Eastern Europe and were lower in Southern Europe.Automotive refinish coatings organic sales grew by a low-single-digit percentage year-over-year, despite lower demand in the U.S. due to customer inventory destocking and lower industry collision claim activity.
Organic sales increased in all other geographic regions as customers continued to adopt PPG’s industry leading technologies.Aerospace coatings sales volumes grew by more than 10 percent versus the prior year, including above-market volume growth in the U.S. and Asia.
Strong growth was supported by positive industry demand fundamentals and market outperformance in all major platforms stemming from technology advantaged products.Protective and marine coatings sales volumes increased by a high-single-digit percentage year-over-year.
Protective coatings sales volumes were up a mid-single-digit percentage, driven by growth in China.
Marine coatings sales volumes grew by more than 10 percent off a low sales base as ship building activity grew modestly in Asia.Segment income decreased $13 million year-over-year primarily driven by increasing raw material and logistics costs.
These cost increases were partially offset by higher selling prices and additional benefits from the Company’s restructuring programs.
Favorable foreign currency translation increased segment income by approximately $15 million, primarily related to the strengthening of the euro.2017 vs. 2016Performance Coatings net sales increased (2%) due to the following: ● Higher selling prices (+1%)● Net sales from acquisitions (+1%)● Modest foreign currency translationPartially offset by:● Slightly lower sales volumes Selling prices increased year-over-year primarily due to selling price initiatives across all businesses to combat accelerating raw material cost inflation.Architectural coatings - Americas and Asia Pacific sales volumes declined a low-single-digit-percentage versus the prior year.
Sales volumes increased by a mid-single-digit percentage in company-owned stores in the U.S. and Canada, including 2018 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 33the unfavorable impact from natural disasters in the third quarter 2017.
This increase was more than offset by sales volume declines in the U.S. and Canada independent dealer networks and national retail (DIY) customer accounts, as both distribution channels continued to experience soft demand.
Organic sales improved in both the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions.Architectural coatings - EMEA net sales increased by a high-single-digit percentage year-over-year, primarily due to acquisition-related sales, principally DEUTEK and Univer, which contributed approximately $85 million to net sales.
Sales volumes were down year-over-year primarily driven by continued weak demand in France and eastern Europe, as well as our turning away certain business due to low profitability or lack of customer acceptance of selling price increases.
Demand growth continued in Northern Europe, where we continued to outperform the market.
Automotive refinish coatings organic sales grew by a low-single-digit percentage year-over-year, led by above-market performance in U.S. and Canada as customers continued to adopt PPG’s industry leading technologies.
Organic sales also increased in the Latin American region versus the prior year, reflecting high end-use market demand.
In Asia Pacific, net sales increased, largely due to the recent Futian Xinshi acquisition in China.Aerospace coatings sales volumes grew by a low-single-digit percentage versus the prior year, led by above market performance in Europe and consistent with the overall industry demand.Protective and marine coatings sales volumes declined by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year.
Protective coatings sales volumes expanded in most regions, led by Europe, but were more than offset by significant weakness in new shipbuilding activity, primarily in the Asia Pacific region.Segment income decreased $9 million year-over-year primarily due increasing raw material costs, wage and other cost inflation, and lower sales volumes partially offset by selling price increases, lower overhead and manufacturing costs, including the initial benefits from business restructuring actions.Looking AheadLooking ahead, year-over-year raw material cost inflation is expected in the first half of 2019, primarily due to carry-over inflation.
Acquisition related sales are forecast to add a low-single-digit percentage of sales growth primarily from the SEM acquisition and based on current exchange rates, we expect foreign currency translation to have an unfavorable impact on segment sales of approximately $100 million in the first quarter.Additionally, further selling price increases are expected in 2019 as we continue to offset the cumulative impact of raw material inflation over the past nine quarters.
Net sales are expected to be lower in the first half compared to 2018 driven by lower U.S. DIY sales of approximately $110 million due to the customer assortment changes that occurred in 2018.
The impact will be larger than the impact realized in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to the seasonality of the U.S. DIY business.34 2018 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-KIndustrial Coatings $ Change % Change($ in millions, except percentages)201820172016 2018 vs. 20172017 vs. 2016 2018 vs. 20172017 vs. 2016Net sales$6,287$6,018$5,690 $269$328 4.5%5.8%Segment income$818$979$1,060 ($161)($81) (16.4)%(7.6)%2018 vs. 2017Industrial Coatings segment net sales increased (5%) due to the following:● Acquisition-related sales (+1.5%)● Higher selling prices (+1.5%)● Higher sales volumes (+1%) Selling prices increased sequentially throughout the year and were up approximately 1.5 percent year-over-year primarily driven by the general industrial and packaging businesses.Industrial coatings sales volumes continued to grow led by strong outperformance in coil, heavy-duty equipment and electronics materials.
From a geographic perspective, sales volume growth was led by EMEA and Latin America.
Acquisition-related sales from The Crown Group added approximately $100 million in sales during the year.Packaging coatings sales volumes were up a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year driven by continued customer adoption of PPG's new can coating technologies.
From a geographic perspective, sales volumes in the developed regions grew a high-single-digit percentage, offset by a low-single-digit percentage decrease in the Asia Pacific region.PPG’s automotive OEM coatings sales volumes were slightly lower versus the prior year, consistent with the global automotive industry growth rate.
In the second half of the year, automotive OEM production fell sharply in China and new emission standards negatively impacted production in Europe.Specialty coatings and materials net sales increased by a low-single-digit percentage due to higher selling prices and higher sales volumes in EMEA.Segment income decreased $161 million year-over-year primarily due to continuing, significant raw material and logistics cost inflation, partially offset by higher selling prices and lower manufacturing costs, including benefits from business restructuring actions.
Favorable foreign currency translation added approximately $5 million to segment income.2017 vs. 2016Industrial Coatings segment net sales increased (6%) due to the following:● Higher sales volumes (+4%)● Acquisition-related sales (+3%)Partially offset by:● Lower selling prices (1%)PPG’s automotive OEM coatings sales volumes increased by a low-single-digit percentage versus the prior year, consistent with the global automotive industry production growth rate, led by China, Mexico, Europe and Brazil.
Sales volumes declined in the U.S. and Canada, partially reflecting fewer automotive new builds.General industrial coatings and specialty coatings and materials sales volumes, in aggregate, grew by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year.
Sales volumes grew year-over-year in every major region with mixed demand by end-use and geography.
This growth was led by Asia Pacific and the U.S., which outpaced regional industrial production demand growth.
Sales volumes grew across most segments, including year-over-year increases in electronics materials, heavy duty equipment and organic light emitting diode (OLED) materials.
Acquisition-related sales, primarily MetoKote, added approximately $155 million.Packaging coatings sales volumes grew by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year, primarily driven by ongoing industry conversions to PPG’s new can coatings technologies, led by the U.S.Segment income decreased $81 million year-over-year primarily due to increasing raw material costs, lower selling prices and wage and other cost inflation.
These cost increases were partially offset by income from higher sales volumes, lower manufacturing and overhead costs, including the initial benefits from business restructuring actions, and acquisition-related income.2018 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 35Looking aheadLooking ahead, we expect that greater volatility in global industrial demand will continue through the first quarter of 2019 with inconsistencies by region.
The carryover impact from 2018 cost inflation and significantly unfavorable foreign currency translation will impact first quarter earnings.
The Company will continue to prioritize implementing selling price increases and operating margin recovery.
Global automotive OEM industry demand is expected to remain soft in the first quarter for most major regions with greater volatility expected in China.
We anticipate that aggregate global general industrial demand growth will continue, but at a more moderate rate than in the first quarter of 2019.
In addition, we expect that the Whitford acquisition will close during the latter portion of the first quarter, pending required regulatory approvals, and therefore will not provide meaningful sales or earnings benefit in the quarter.
In addition, we expect packaging sales volumes to moderate as the pace of technology conversions slow in 2019.Review and OutlookDuring 2018, economic conditions were generally positive in all of our major geographical regions while remaining mixed by end-uses.
PPG’s aggregate organic sales grew approximately 3% versus the prior year.
Acquisition-related sales from two acquisitions completed in 2017 and the four completed in 2018 contributed approximately 1% to net sales growth year-over-year, net of dispositions.
Foreign currency translation was favorable for the first half of the year then turned unfavorable in the second half of the year.
For the full year 2018, foreign currency translation favorably impacted sales by approximately 1%.
Raw material inflation was elevated throughout the year and overall rose a mid-single digit percentage driven by supply related factors, including government mandated production curtailments in China to help improve pollution and higher oil prices.
In addition, logistics costs were significantly higher in 2018 driven by higher oil prices and shortages in the availability in transportation.U.S.
and CanadaDuring 2018, the pace of economic activity improved in the U.S. and Canada region versus the prior year, led by stronger GDP growth in the U.S. despite flat automotive industry builds.
Demand in the residential and commercial construction markets was modestly higher in 2018 compared to 2017.
New home starts advanced approximately 4% in 2018 versus approximately 3% in 2017.
Residential remodeling was flat in 2018 versus 2017, while commercial construction was flat compared to a 1% decline in 2017.
Market demand for architectural paint continued to shift more to the professional trade painters channel as the continued decline in U.S. unemployment resulted in consumers choosing professional painters rather than completing projects themselves.
Demand in U.S. do-it-yourself (DIY) paint stores continued to remain soft throughout the year consistent with 2017.
PPG’s architectural coatings performance in the U.S. and Canada was impacted by DIY customer assortment changes that unfavorably impacted sales by approximately $100 million.
The automotive refinish coatings business was impacted by lower collision rates and a higher number of automobiles in accidents being totaled rather than repainted offsetting modest growth in miles driven.
PPG’s packaging coatings business continued to expand well ahead of the industry driven by continued strong sales growth momentum related to customer adoption of PPG’s new interior can coatings technologies.
PPG’s automotive OEM coatings business performance was slightly better than industry demand levels due to modest share gains.
The U.S. and Canada region remained PPG’s largest, representing approximately 42% of 2018 sales, although a smaller percentage of total sales than in the prior year.Europe, Middle East and AfricaEuropean economic activity was mixed in 2018.
Industrial production was higher in the first half of the year and moderated as the year progressed.
The region was impacted by continuing uncertainty over the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union.
Overall GDP and industrial production were similar to 2017 in the region.
Regional demand continued to be mixed by country and end-uses.
Demand for PPG’s products in several end-uses drove the regional growth rate, including above market performance in general industrial coatings, packaging coatings and specialty coatings and materials.
PPG’s architectural coatings - EMEA business sales volumes decreased year-over-year, driven by soft demand in Southern Europe.EMEA represented approximately 30% of PPG’s 2018 sales, similar to prior year levels.
Regional coatings volumes remain approximately 15% below their pre-recession levels in 2008.
The modest volume recovery reflects the slow pace of economic growth in the region.
PPG expects modest volume growth over time at attractive incremental margins due to significant cost structure improvements and available capacity to satisfy additional demand.
In the second half of the year, the euro and British pound both depreciated against the U.S. dollar.
Asia Pacific and Latin AmericaThe emerging regions of Asia Pacific and Latin America represented 28% of PPG’s 2018 sales in aggregate, similar to the prior year.36 2018 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-KAsia remained the largest emerging region, with sales of approximately $2.5 billion, led by China, which continued as PPG’s second largest country by revenue.
The Performance Coatings segment led sales volume growth in Asia, in part due to strong sales volume growth in protective and marine coatings, aerospace coatings, and automotive refinish coatings.
These increases were partially offset by a decline in automotive OEM coatings, particularly in China where industry retail automobile sales fell for the first time in over 25 years.
Overall, demand in Latin America improved year-over-year for the second consecutive year, with continued above market growth in Mexico and Central America.
Economic conditions were mixed in South America, and there was heightened currency volatility throughout the entire region.
In Mexico, the PPG-Comex business added over 200 new concessionaire locations.
The overall region’s performance was supported by strong growth in the general industrial and packaging coatings businesses.
Foreign currency translation was volatile and finished 4 percent unfavorable compared to 2017, principally the Mexican peso and Brazilian real.
OutlookLooking ahead to 2019, we expect global market growth to continue, but we expect a downshift in the pace of growth, and it will likely be uneven by region and end-use.
We expect most regional growth rates to be modestly lower than 2018, but the Latin America region growth rate to be slightly higher.We anticipate PPG’s U.S. and Canada regional growth will be led by general industrial coatings and aerospace coatings, with flat automotive industry builds.
We expect growth in housing and commercial construction to be comparable to 2018.We expect demand in Europe to grow but at lower levels than 2018.
Regional growth is expected to remain mixed by sub-region and country.
Favorable end-use trends are expected to continue in general industrial and packaging with flattening demand in automotive OEM coatings as industry growth rates are anticipated to be flat.
Demand is expected to stay subdued in the architectural coatings business.
We continue to monitor the economic environment in the U.K. as their exit from the European Union progresses and impacts consumer sentiment and coatings demand.In Asia Pacific, we expect continued industrial production growth in China, Southeast Asia and India.
In China, we foresee continued above global average growth with heightened risk as the Chinese economy continues to shift and rely more on domestic consumption.
The sharp decline in automotive OEM activity seen in the second half of 2018 is expected to continue in the beginning of 2019.
We expect year-over-year demand patterns to become more favorable in the second half of 2019.
The recovery in marine coatings demand is expected to continue, albeit off a low base.
In Latin America, we anticipate economic expansion will continue in Mexico, most of Central America and South America.Significant other factorsIn May 2018, PPG initiated an $83 million global restructuring program.
The program is largely centered around the change in customer assortment related to the U.S. architectural coatings DIY business.
PPG recognized $18 million of savings from this program in 2018.Significant progress was made on the global restructuring program that was announced in December 2016.
This program targeted annual savings of approximately $125 million once fully implemented.
The Company achieved approximately $60 million of savings in 2018 bringing the total savings to approximately $110 million to date.
We expect to achieve the full-annualized target of $125 million in 2019.
We will continue to aggressively manage the Company’s cost structure to ensure alignment with the overall demand environment, and we will make adjustments as required to remain competitive in the marketplace.
Restructuring savings from the 2018 and 2016 programs are expected to be between $60 million and $70 million in 2019.Raw materials are a significant input cost to the process of manufacturing coatings.
PPG experiences fluctuating energy and raw material costs driven by various factors, including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories, global industry activity levels, foreign currency exchange rates, and global supply and demand factors.
In aggregate, average raw material costs were higher by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2018 versus 2017 due to variety of reasons, including supplier force majeure, environmental regulation enforcement, and higher crude oil prices.
PPG currently expects overall coatings raw material prices to increase a low-single-digit percentage in the first half of 2019, with impacts varied by region and commodity, marking the tenth and eleventh consecutive quarters of inflation.
In addition, logistics costs were inflated throughout the year driven by higher crude oil prices and availability of transportation.
Logistics costs are expected to further increase in 2019.
In 2018, we achieved broad selling price improvement, reflecting the Company’s efforts to offset higher raw material costs.
Further benefits from selling price actions are necessary in 2019 to recover profit contribution margins.
The Company will carefully monitor raw material costs during 2019 and assess the need for additional increases to selling prices for increases in these costs.2018 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 37Pension and postretirement benefit costs, excluding settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits, totaled approximately $30 million in 2018, down approximately $20 million from 2017.
In 2019, we expect pension and other postretirement benefit costs will be approximately $30 million, similar to 2018.PPG contributed $75 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2018 and $54 million in 2017.
In 2018, the Company made contributions aggregating $24 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans.
In 2019, mandatory contributions to PPG’s non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be between $20 million and $30 million.In 2018, favorable foreign currency translation experienced in the first half of the year was mostly offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation experienced in the second half of the year.
Based on mid-January 2019 exchange rates, the Company expects year-over-year unfavorable foreign currency translation to decrease 2019 sales by $400 million to $500 million and 2019 income before income taxes by $50 million to $70 million.
We expect the foreign currency translation impact to be more prevalent during the first half of 2019 due to prior year foreign exchange rate trends.
The foreign currency environment continues to be volatile, and the impact on 2019 net sales and income before income taxes could differ from this estimate.
The Company generally purchases raw materials, incurs manufacturing costs and sells finished goods in the same currency, so we typically incur only modest foreign currency transaction related impacts.The 2019 effective tax rate from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of 23% to 25%.
This range represents the Company’s best estimate, including updated guidance for the 2017 the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Over the past five years, the Company used over $5 billion of cash to repurchase approximately 50 million shares of PPG stock, including approximately $1.7 billion in 2018.
The Company ended the year with approximately $1.8 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.
During 2018, the Company deployed approximately $380 million for acquisitions and $450 million for dividends.
PPG increased its per-share dividend in October 2018, marking the 47th annual per share dividend increase and the 119th consecutive year of annual dividend payments.
PPG ended 2018 with approximately $1 billion in cash and short-term investments.
The Company expects continued strong cash generation in 2019.Accounting Standards Adopted in 2018 Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the Company’s recently adopted accounting pronouncements.Accounting Standards to be Adopted in Future YearsNote 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes accounting pronouncements that have been promulgated prior to December 31, 2018 but are not effective until a future date.Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, including Environmental MattersPPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, including some that it has asserted against others, in which substantial monetary damages are sought.
See Item 3.
“Legal Proceedings” and Note 14, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a description of certain of these lawsuits.As discussed in Item 3 and Note 14, although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable, management believes that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving PPG, including asbestos-related claims, will not have a material effect on PPG’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized.It is PPG’s policy to accrue expenses for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
Reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted.
In management’s opinion, the Company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the Company’s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on PPG’s financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized.
Management anticipates that the resolution of the Company’s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time.
The Company continues to analyze, assess and remediate the environmental issues associated with PPG’s former chromium manufacturing plant in Jersey City, N.J. and associated sites (“New Jersey Chrome”).
Information will continue to be generated from the ongoing groundwater remedial investigation activities related to New Jersey Chrome and will be incorporated into a final draft remedial action work plan for groundwater expected to be submitted to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 2021.There are multiple, future events yet to occur, including further remedy selection and design, remedy implementation and execution and applicable governmental agency or community organization approvals.
Considerable uncertainty exists 38 2018 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-Kregarding the timing of these future events for the New Jersey Chrome sites.
Final resolution of these events is expected to occur over the next several years.
As these events occur and to the extent that the cost estimates of the environmental remediation remedies change, the existing reserve for this environmental remediation matter will be adjusted.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesDuring the past three years, PPG has had sufficient financial resources to meet its operating requirements, to fund our capital spending, including acquisitions, share repurchases and pension plans and to pay increasing dividends to shareholders.Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments($ in millions)2018 2017Cash and cash equivalents$902 $1,436Short-term investments61 55Total$963 $1,491Cash from operating activities - continuing operations($ in millions, except percentages) % Change 2018201720162018 vs. 20172017 vs. 2016Cash from operating activities$1,487$1,551$1,218(4.1)%27.3%2018 vs. 2017The $64 million decrease in Cash from operating activities - continuing operations was primarily due to unfavorable changes in working capital and lower income in 2018 partially offset by lower cash taxes.
2017 vs. 2016The $333 million increase in Cash from operating activities - continuing operations was primarily due to the absence of the prior year funding of the Pittsburgh Corning asbestos trust (the “Trust”), lower defined benefit pension contributions, lower restructuring payments and lower interest payments, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid in 2017 and higher working capital.
Operating working capital Operating Working Capital is a subset of total working capital and represents (1) receivables from customers, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, (2) inventories, and (3) trade liabilities.
See Note 4, “Working Capital Detail” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information related to the components of the Company’s Operating Working Capital.
We believe Operating Working Capital represents the key components of working capital under the operating control of our businesses.A key metric we use to measure our working capital management is Operating Working Capital as a percentage of sales (fourth quarter sales annualized).

Contributions to PPG’s non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in 2018 were required by local funding requirements.
PPG expects to make mandatory contributions to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in the range of $20 million to $30 million in 2019.
PPG may make voluntary contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2019 and beyond.Asbestos settlement trust fundingIn June 2016, PPG fully funded its portion of the trust that was established by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania in May 2016.
PPG’s total cash obligations to fund the Trust totaled $813 million (pre-tax).
All payments were applied against a previously established PPG reserve for the total asbestos trust obligation.
The Company utilized cash on hand for the payments, and this funding had no impact on PPG’s previously stated cash-deployment targets.

A primary focus for the Company in 2019 will continue to be cash deployment focused on shareholder value creation, with a preference for business acquisitions.
Cash proceeds from divestituresIn September 2017, PPG completed the sale of its North American fiber glass business to Nippon Electric Glass Co. and received approximately $540 million in pre-tax cash proceeds.
During 2016, PPG finalized the sale of its flat glass business and several other businesses and business affiliates.
The Company received total pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion from these business divestitures.

The Credit Agreement provides for a $1.8 billion unsecured revolving credit facility.
The Credit Agreement will terminate on December 18, 2020.
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no borrowings outstanding.In addition to the amounts available under the lines of credit, the Company maintains access to the capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity.
See Note 9, “Borrowings and Lines of Credit” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding notes entered into and repaid as well as details regarding the use and availability of committed and uncommitted lines of credit, letters of credit, guarantees and debt covenants.2018 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 41Contractual obligationsWe continue to believe that our cash on hand and short term investments, cash from operations and the Company’s access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital spending, acquisitions, dividend payments, debt service, share repurchases, contributions to pension plans, and PPG’s significant contractual obligations.
These significant contractual obligations are presented in the following table.

(3)The unconditional purchase commitments are principally take-or-pay obligations related to the purchase of certain materials, including industrial gases and electricity, consistent with customary industry practice.
Other liquidity mattersAt December 31, 2018, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits, was $182 million.
The timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities.
PPG does not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year.
The Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements include the operating leases and unconditional purchase commitments disclosed in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section in the contractual obligations table as well as letters of credit and guarantees as discussed in Note 9, “Borrowings and Lines of Credit” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Critical Accounting EstimatesManagement has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes presented under Item 8 of this Form 10-K and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate.
We believe that the most critical accounting estimates made in the preparation of our financial statements are those related to accounting for contingencies, under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, and to accounting for pensions, other postretirement benefits, business combinations, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies.ContingenciesContingencies, by their nature, relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss.
The most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to environmental remediation, to pending, impending or overtly threatened litigation against the Company and to the resolution of matters related to open tax years.
For more information on these matters, see Note 14, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” and Note 12, “Income Taxes” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit PlansAccounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works.
To accomplish this, we make extensive use of assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, turnover, medical costs and discount rates.
The Company has 42 2018 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-Kestablished a process by which management reviews and selects these assumptions annually.
See Note 13, “Employee Benefit Plans” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information on these plans and the assumptions used.Business CombinationsIn accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations, the Company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition.
The excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized as goodwill.
The valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results.
In addition to using management estimates and negotiated amounts, the Company uses a variety of information sources to determine the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including: third-party appraisals for the estimated value and lives of identifiable intangible assets and property, plant and equipment; third-party actuaries for the estimated obligations of defined benefit pension plans and similar benefit obligations; and legal counsel or other experts to assess the obligations associated with legal, environmental and other contingent liabilities.
The business and technical judgment of management was used in determining which intangible assets have indefinite lives and in determining the useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsThe Company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment annually by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test.
The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of a reporting unit or asset is less than its carrying amount.
Fair values under the quantitative test are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows.
For more information on these matters, see Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K related to these contingencies, pensions, other postretirement benefits, business combinations, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate PPG management, although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates.CurrencyComparing exchange rates from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, the U.S. dollar strengthened against all other major currencies associated with countries in which PPG operates, most notably the Australian dollar, British pound, Chinese yuan, euro and South Korean won.
As a result, consolidated net assets at December 31, 2018 decreased by approximately $167 million from December 31, 2017.
Comparing exchange rates from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, the U.S. dollar was weaker against the currencies in most countries in which PPG operates, most notably the Mexican peso, British pound, Chinese yuan and euro.
As a result, consolidated net assets at December 31, 2017 increased by approximately $231 million from December 31, 2016.
Comparing exchange rates during 2018 to those of 2017, in the countries in which PPG operates, there was a favorable impact of approximately $21 million on full year 2018 income before income taxes from the translation of this foreign income into U.S. dollars.
Comparing exchange rates during 2017 to those of 2016, in the countries in which PPG operates, there was an unfavorable impact of approximately $7 million on full year 2017 income before income taxes from the translation of this foreign income into U.S. dollars.Forward-Looking StatementsThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis and other sections of this Annual Report contain forward-looking statements that reflect the Company’s current views with respect to future events and financial performance.You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to current or historic facts.
Forward-looking statements are identified by the use of the words “aim,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “project,” “outlook,” “forecast” and other expressions that indicate future events and trends.
Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Also, note the following cautionary statements.Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company’s forward-looking statements.
Such factors include global economic conditions, increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors, fluctuations 2018 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 43in cost and availability of raw materials, the ability to achieve selling price increases, the ability to recover margins, customer inventory levels, our ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, the timing of and the realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring initiatives, the ability to identify additional cost savings opportunities, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom, economic and political conditions in the markets we serve, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, fluctuations in tax rates, the impact of future legislation, the impact of environmental regulations, unexpected business disruptions, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, including the identification of additional control deficiencies, further expenditures related to our restatement, the results of governmental actions relating to pending investigations, the results of shareholder actions relating to the restatement of our financial statements and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation.
However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.Consequently, while the list of factors presented here and under Item 1A is considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.
Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements.Consequences of material differences in the results compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, lower sales or income, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties, other factors set forth in Item 1A of this Form 10-K and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskPPG is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and was exposed to changes in PPG’s stock price.
The Company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks.
A detailed description of these exposures and the Company’s risk management policies are provided in Note 10, “Financial Instruments, Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.The following disclosures summarize PPG’s exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks.
Quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible, unfavorable changes in market rates can impact PPG’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position.Foreign Currency RiskWe conduct operations in many countries around the world.
Our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction and currency translation risk.
Foreign currency forward contracts outstanding during 2018 and 2017 were generally designated as a hedge of PPG’s exposure to foreign currency transaction risk.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of $36 million and a net liability of $19 million, respectively.
The potential reduction in PPG’s Income before income taxes resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for European and Canadian currencies and 20% for Asian and Latin American currencies for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 would have been $291 million and $255 million, respectively.In February 2018, PPG entered into U.S. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of $575 million outstanding, which had a fair value of a net asset of $35 million as of December 31, 2018.
As of December 31, 2017, PPG had U.S. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with a total notional amount of $560 million outstanding, which had a fair value of a net asset of $2 million.
A 10% increase in the value of the euro to the U.S. dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts by reducing the value of these instruments by $57 million and $58 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, PPG had non-U.S. dollar denominated debt outstanding of $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively.
A weakening of the U.S. dollar by 10% against European currencies and by 20% against Asian and South American currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of $299 million and $314 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Interest Rate RiskThe Company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs.
In the first quarter of 2018, PPG entered into interest rate swaps which converted $525 million of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt.
The fair value of these contracts was an asset of $8 million as of December 31, 2018.
