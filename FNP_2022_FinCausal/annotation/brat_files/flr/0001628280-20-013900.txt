Item 7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements.
Restatement of Previously Issued Financial StatementsWe have determined that our previously issued financial statements contained errors.
Accordingly, we have restated our financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 and our unaudited interim financial statements as of and for each of the previously issued quarterly periods in 2019 and 2018, to correct the identified errors.
Our financial statements contain additional information related to the restatement, including descriptions of the misstatements and the impacts on our financial statements.Results of OperationsInitiatives impacting our 2019 operations included the following:•During the first quarter of 2019, we approved and initiated a broad restructuring plan designed to optimize costs, improve operational efficiency and support long-term sustainable growth.
These restructuring activities included the rationalization of resources, investments, real estate and overhead across various geographies.
•During the second quarter of 2019, we met with a number of our clients, subcontractors and suppliers in an attempt to bring resolution to or get clarification on a variety of matters, including outstanding disputes and claims, pending change orders, schedule extensions, accounts receivable and other project close out items.
The negotiations and agreements resulting from these meetings, as well as project developments during the second quarter, resulted in the recognition of significant charges across three segments, which are reflected in the results for 2019.
•During the third quarter of 2019, management committed to a plan to sell substantially all of our government and AMECO equipment businesses, while retaining two fixed price projects (associated with the U.S. government) and a few small international components of AMECO.
The operations of these businesses to be divested are presented as discontinued operations, net of tax, for all periods presented.
During 2020, the company reversed its decision to sell the government business and will revert its results as a component of continuing operations for all periods to be presented beginning with the first quarter of 2020.•During the third quarter of 2019, management reviewed our business lines, markets and geographies and changed the composition of our reportable segments to align them with the manner in which the chief executive officer manages the business and allocates resources.
The Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment was separated into a Mining & Industrial segment and an Infrastructure & Power segment.
The operations of NuScale, as well as two retained U.S. government projects, were combined into a newly created segment called Other.
At December 31, 2019, we reported our operating results in the following five reportable segments:◦Energy & Chemicals◦Mining & Industrial ◦Infrastructure & Power◦Diversified Services◦OtherSegment information for 2018 and 2017 has been recast to reflect these changes.
In light of our decision to retain our government business, beginning in the first quarter of 2020 our government business will be reported as the Government segment and we will report our operating results in six reportable segments.38Table of Contents(in millions)

We believe that total segment profit (loss) provides a meaningful perspective on our business results as it is the aggregation of individual segment profit (loss) measures that we use to evaluate and manage our business performance.We adopted ASC Topic 606 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" on January 1, 2018.
The impact of adoption was an increase to our revenue during 2018 of $132 million, primarily in the Energy & Chemicals segment.
Changes to segment revenue and margin are discussed later in MD&A.During 2019, we recognized charges (related to cumulative catch up adjustments and loss projects) totaling $839 million in the Energy & Chemicals, Infrastructure & Power and Other segments.
We also recognized $533 million related to impairments, restructuring and other exit costs.
Additionally, we settled the remaining obligations associated with our defined 39Table of Contentsbenefit pension plan in the United Kingdom and recognized a loss on pension settlement of $138 million during 2019.
During 2018, we recognized charges totaling $417 million related to projects in the Energy & Chemicals, Infrastructure & Power and Other segments.
These project charges were partially offset by a gain of $125 million from the sale of a joint venture interest in the United Kingdom.
Earnings in 2018 also benefitted from the adoption of ASC 606 which resulted in an increase to earnings before taxes of $132 million, primarily in the Energy & Chemicals segment.
During 2017, we recognized charges totaling $341 million related to projects in the Energy & Chemicals, Infrastructure & Power and Other segments.
The effective tax rate from continuing operations was (34.5%), 70.3% and 30.4% for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
The effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by $731 million in charges related to establishing valuation allowances attributable to the U.S., the U.K. and Australia to reduce net deferred tax assets.
The 2018 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted due to a $79 million increase in valuation allowances attributable to the U.S., the Netherlands and Belgium to reduce certain deferred tax assets.
The effective tax rate for 2017 was unfavorably impacted by a $53 million tax charge resulting from the enactment in 2017 of comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "2017 Tax Act").
Apart from the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, the effective tax rate for 2017 benefited from the release of a deferred tax liability as a result of the restructuring of certain international operations and a worthless stock deduction for an insolvent foreign subsidiary.
These benefits were partially offset by the establishment of valuation allowances on certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards.
The 2018 and 2017 periods benefitted from earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for which income taxes are not typically our responsibility.Our results reported by foreign subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are affected by foreign currency volatility.
When the U.S. dollar appreciates against the non-U.S. dollar functional currencies of these subsidiaries, our reported revenue, cost and earnings, after translation into U.S. dollars, are lower than what they would have been had the U.S. dollar depreciated against the same foreign currencies or if there had been no change in the exchange rates.Our margins, in some cases, may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by a change in the amount of materials and customer-furnished materials, which are accounted for as pass-through costs.
As a result of adopting ASC 606 on January 1, 2018, we now generally account for engineering and construction contracts as a single performance obligation, resulting in a more constant recognition of revenue and margin over the term of the contract than under the previous guidance in which we typically segmented between the engineering and construction phases of its contracts.
Prior to 2018, changes in the mix of work performed by us had a larger impact, favorably or unfavorably, on our margins.
Segment profit margins were generally higher during the earlier stages of the project life cycle as project execution activities were more heavily weighted to higher margin engineering activities rather than lower margin construction activities, particularly when there was a significant amount of materials, including customer-furnished materials, recognized during construction.
For example, during 2017, margins in our Energy & Chemicals segment were adversely affected by a shift in the mix of work from higher margin engineering activities to lower margin construction activities.The lack of broad based new awards could continue to put pressure on our earnings streams, particularly in the Energy & Chemicals segment.
The decrease in backlog during 2019 primarily resulted from new award activity being outpaced by work performed as well as the removal of certain contracts associated with our joint venture in Mexico that were suspended in 2019.
The increase in backlog during 2018 primarily resulted from new award activity.
As of December 31, 2019, 41 percent of our revenue backlog was reimbursable while 59 percent was for fixed-price or lump-sum contracts.
As of December 31, 2019, approximately 26 percent of consolidated backlog related to a single lump-sum project in the Energy & Chemicals segment.
Certain of our businesses have been adversely affected by the economic impacts of the outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus ("COVID-19") and the steep decline in commodity prices that occurred in the early part of 2020.
Both of these events have created significant uncertainty and economic volatility and disruption, which have impacted and may continue to impact our business operations.
We have experienced, and may continue to experience, reductions in demand for certain of our services and the delay or abandonment of ongoing or anticipated projects due to our clients’, suppliers’ and other third parties’ diminished financial conditions or financial distress, as well as governmental budget constraints.
These impacts are expected to continue or worsen if stay-at-home, social distancing, travel restrictions and other similar orders or restrictions remain in place for an extended period of time or are re-imposed after being lifted or eased.
Because of these events, we performed interim impairment testing of our goodwill, intangible assets and investments.
We also evaluated the impact of these events on our reserves for credit risk and the fair value of our assets held for sale.
While significant uncertainty exists concerning the magnitude of the impact and duration of these events, the company expects to recognize losses ranging from $450 million to $475 million during the first quarter of 2020, for such matters.
40Table of ContentsDiscontinued Operations During 2019, management committed to a plan to sell substantially all of our government and AMECO equipment businesses, while retaining two lump-sum projects previously included in the government segment and a few small international components of AMECO.
These disposal groups meet the held for sale criteria, and as a result, the underlying assets and liabilities have been classified as held for sale for all periods presented.
The operations of the disposal groups also qualify for discontinued operations, and therefore their results have been presented as earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, for all periods presented.
In the first quarter of 2020, we decided to retain our government business, which will no longer be reported as discontinued operations in 2020.On August 1, 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement in connection with legal matters related to a previously divested business.
The resulting gain on settlement as well as all legal fees associated with this matter were reported in 2019's earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax.Impairment, Restructuring and Other Exit CostsDuring 2019, we initiated a broad restructuring plan designed to optimize costs and improve operational efficiency.
These efforts primarily relate to the rationalization of resources, investments, real estate and overhead across various geographies, as well as the liquidation of certain components of the AMECO business that are being excluded from sale.
We expect that our restructuring activities will be substantially completed in 2020.
Asset impairment charges included the write down of assets held for sale to fair value less cost to sell and the write down of certain other assets to fair value.

Impairment losses on: Intangible customer relationships $33.7 Investments256.8 Goodwill2.1 Total impairments$292.6
Impairment, restructuring and other exit costs$532.6 (1) Includes amounts recognized in 2019.Given the 2019 performance in certain businesses and geographies, the significant drop in our stock price since our second quarter earnings release, and changes in pursuit criteria, we performed interim impairment tests of our goodwill, intangible assets and significant investments during the third quarter of 2019.
We quantitatively determined that none of our goodwill was impaired as of September 30, 2019.
However, we recognized an impairment loss on our intangible customer relationships associated with Stork.
During the fourth quarter of 2019, we recognized goodwill impairment of approximately $2 million in connection with the liquidation of a business.
Completion of our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2019 resulted in no further impairment.
We also evaluated our significant investments and determined that certain of our investments were other-than-temporarily impaired as of September 30, 2019.
Segment OperationsWe provide professional services in the fields of engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication and modularization, operations, maintenance and asset integrity, as well as project management services, on a global basis and serve a diverse set of industries worldwide.
We consider charges to include effects that negatively impact a project's gross margin, including negative adjustments to revenue and recognition of project losses.41Table of ContentsEnergy & ChemicalsRevenue in 2019 decreased compared to 2018 due to a significant decline in the volume of customer-furnished materials and project execution activities, combined with the impact of a lower volume of broad based new awards.
The revenue decline in 2019 was partially offset by increased project execution activity for a liquefied natural gas project in Canada.
Revenue in 2018 decreased compared to 2017, primarily due to reduced volume of project execution activity for several chemicals and downstream projects that were nearing completion in 2017.
This revenue decline was partially offset by an increase in project execution activities for a large upstream project.Segment profit in 2019 significantly decreased compared to 2018, primarily due to the following 2019 items:•$260 million in charges resulting from late design changes, schedule-driven cost growth including liquidated damages, and subcontractor negotiations on a lump-sum, offshore project; •$87 million in charges resulting from schedule-driven cost growth and client and subcontractor negotiations on two lump-sum, downstream projects and scope reductions on a large upstream project; •$31 million in charges resulting from the resolution of certain close-out matters with a customer;•$26 million in charges resulting from the write-off of pre-contract costs due to the continued evaluation of the probability of receiving an award; and•$26 million of unrealized foreign currency losses associated with embedded foreign currency derivatives of our joint venture in Mexico, primarily due to the full suspension of certain client contracts in the second quarter of 2019.
Segment profit in 2018 included the following items:•$133 million in charges for estimated cost growth on a completed, lump-sum, downstream project;•$40 million in charges resulting from estimated cost growth on the offshore project mentioned above; •reduced volume of project execution activity for several downstream projects that were nearing completion in 2017; and•the favorable impact of the adoption of ASC 606.Segment profit in 2017 included charges totaling $44 million for estimated cost growth on the downstream project mentioned above.The changes in segment profit margin in 2019 and 2018 were primarily attributable to the same factors that affected revenue and segment profit.
We are currently in discussions with the clients of the two lump-sum, downstream projects mentioned above over unapproved change orders totaling $66 million for cost growth and extension of time due to client-caused delays.
Our current forecasts are based on the probability of favorably resolving these matters.
Revenue and segment profit could be adversely affected if these matters are not successfully resolved, including the assessment of liquidated damages for which our combined maximum exposure for both projects is approximately $121 million.New awards in 2019 included a downstream project in the United Kingdom as well as chemicals projects in China, India and on the U.S. gulf coast.
New awards in 2018 included a liquefied natural gas export facility in Canada as well as an engineering and procurement contract for a refinery in Texas.
New awards in 2017 included an offshore project in the North Sea, a propylene oxide project in Texas, a petrochemical project in Malaysia and two refinery projects in Texas.
The decrease in backlog during 2019 resulted primarily from new award activity being outpaced by work performed as well as the removal of certain contracts associated with our joint venture in Mexico that were suspended during 2019.
The increase in backlog during 2018 resulted from the new award activity discussed above.Mining & IndustrialRevenue in 2019 increased compared to 2018 primarily due to increased project execution activities for several large mining projects as well as work performed for an advanced manufacturing client.
Revenue in 2018 increased compared to 2017 primarily due to increased project execution activity for several large mining projects.
Segment profit in 2019 increased compared to 2018 due to the increased volume of project execution activities for the projects mentioned above as well as a benefit of $31 million recognized in 2019 resulting from a favorable resolution of a 42Table of Contentslongstanding customer dispute.
Segment profit in 2018 increased compared to 2017 due to the increased volume of project execution activities for the projects mentioned above.
The changes in segment profit margin in 2019 and 2018 were primarily attributable to the same factors impacting segment profit in those years.
New awards in 2019 included an advanced manufacturing project in the Netherlands.
New awards in 2018 included a copper project in the south of Peru, an iron ore replacement mine in Australia and a mine expansion project in Peru.
New awards in 2017 included a mining project in Chile.
The decrease in backlog during 2019 was primarily due to new award activity being outpaced by work performed.
The increase in backlog during 2018 primarily resulted from the new award activity discussed above.
Infrastructure & PowerRevenue in 2019 decreased compared to 2018 primarily due to the substantial completion of certain large power projects during 2019.
This decline was partially offset by increased project execution activities on several infrastructure projects.
Revenue also reflects the adverse impact of various forecast revisions discussed below.
Revenue in 2018 decreased compared to 2017 primarily due to reduced levels of project execution activity for the large power projects discussed above.
This decline was partially offset by increased project execution activities on certain infrastructure projects.
Segment profit in 2019 significantly decreased compared to 2018, primarily due to the following 2019 charges:•$135 million, including the settlement of client disputes, as well as cost growth related to certain close-out matters, on three lump-sum, gas-fired power plant projects that were substantially complete as of December 31, 2019; and•$133 million resulting from late engineering changes and schedule-driven cost growth, as well as negotiations with clients and subcontractors on pending change orders, for several infrastructure projects.
Segment profit in 2018 included the following items:•$188 million in charges on one of the aforementioned power projects as a result of cost growth; and•$125 million gain associated with the sale of a joint venture interest in the United Kingdom.
Segment profit in 2017 was adversely affected by charges totaling $260 million resulting from estimated cost growth at the three lump-sum, gas-fired power plant projects.
The changes in segment profit margin in 2019 and 2018 were primarily attributable to the same factors impacting segment profit in those years.
Lower margin contributions from certain infrastructure projects for which charges were recognized during 2019 may continue to adversely impact near term segment profit margin.New awards in 2019 included a large infrastructure project in Texas and the Red and Purple Line Modernization project for the Chicago Transit Authority.
New awards in 2018 included an international bridge project in Canada and the Los Angeles International Airport Automated People Mover project.
New awards in 2017 included the Southern Gateway project in Texas, the A10 Zuidasdok infrastructure project in Amsterdam and the Green Line Light Rail Extension project in Boston.
The decrease in backlog during 2019 was primarily due to work performed and project cancellations outpacing new award activity.
The increase in backlog during 2018 primarily resulted from the new award activity discussed above.Diversified ServicesAs discussed elsewhere, most of the operating results of our AMECO equipment business are now included in discontinued operations.
Certain operations of AMECO, primarily in Mexico, are in the process of being liquidated and did not meet the qualifications of discontinued operations.
These retained operations will remain in the Diversified Services segment until liquidation is complete.Revenue in 2019 decreased compared to 2018, primarily due to lower volumes in the Stork business in Europe, the cancellation of a large operations and maintenance project in North America in 2018 and scope reductions on a maintenance project in Australia.
The decline in 2019 revenue was further driven by scope reductions on a large power services project in the U.S. and lower volumes at the AMECO equipment business in Mexico.
The revenue declines in 2019 were partially offset by higher contributions from the staffing business in North America and Europe.
Revenue in 2018 remained relatively flat compared to 2017.
Revenue growth from Stork operations in Latin America and the staffing business were offset by the cancellation of the large operations and maintenance project in North America and revenue declines in the equipment and power services businesses.43Table of ContentsSegment profit in 2019 decreased compared to 2018 primarily driven by the above mentioned reduced volumes of higher margin specialty services in the operations and maintenance business and the closure of the AMECO equipment business in Mexico.
The decline in segment profit in 2019 was further driven by charges recognized in the second quarter related to negotiations with clients and joint venture partners.
Segment profit in 2018 decreased compared to 2017, primarily due to the cancellation of the large operations and maintenance project in North America and lower contributions from the power services businesses.
The declines in segment profit margin in 2019 and 2018 were primarily due to the same factors affecting segment profit.The increase in backlog during 2019 was primarily due to a large award for the power services business.
The reduction in backlog during 2018 resulted from scope changes on certain power services projects and the cancellation of the large operations and maintenance project in North America.
The equipment and staffing businesses do not report backlog or new awards.OtherOther includes the operations of NuScale, as well as two lump-sum projects that are being excluded from the sale of the government business, including a plant for which we serve as a subcontractor to a commercial client (the "Radford" project) and a weapons storage and maintenance facility that commenced earlier this year (the "Warren" project).
The Radford and Warren projects are projecting losses as of December 31, 2019.Segment loss in 2019 included charges totaling $59 million resulting from forecast revisions for cost growth on the Warren project and charges totaling $83 million resulting from forecast revisions for late engineering changes and cost growth related to the Radford project.
Segment loss in 2018 and 2017 included charges totaling $56 million and $37 million, respectively, on the Radford project.
Our forecast for both projects is based on our assessment of the probable cost to finish the projects as well as our assessment of the recovery of unapproved change orders.
The Radford project includes the construction of a complex, large-scale nitrocellulose manufacturing facility.
The Warren project requires the procurement and installation of certain first-of-a-kind technologies that are inherently more difficult to estimate.
If our forecasts for these projects are not achieved, revenue and segment profit could be further adversely affected.
We continue to pursue recovery of all unapproved change orders associated with these projects.NuScale expenses, net of qualified reimbursable expenses, included in the determination of segment loss, were $66 million, $74 million and $76 million during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

However, in 2018, most major foreign currencies weakened against the U.S. dollar resulting in foreign currency exchange gains.The decrease in net interest expense during 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in interest income from time deposits held at the large LNG project in Canada in 2019 as well as the payment of a "make-whole" premium associated with the redemption of $500 million of 3.375% Senior Notes in 2018.Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our financial statements.
The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Estimates are based on information available through the date of the issuance of the financial statements and, accordingly, actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates.
44Table of ContentsSignificant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements apply to the following critical accounting policies:Revenue Recognition for Long-Term Contracts.
We recognize our engineering and construction contract revenue over time as we provide services to satisfy our performance obligations.
We generally use the cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion measure of progress as it best depicts how control transfers to our clients.
The cost-to-cost approach measures progress towards completion based on the ratio of contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost.
Use of the cost-to-cost measure of progress requires us to prepare estimates of total expected revenue and cost to complete our projects.
Due to the nature of our industry, there is significant complexity in our estimation of total expected revenue and cost, for which we must make significant judgments.
Our contracts with our customers may contain award fees, incentive fees, liquidated damages or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the contract price to arrive at estimated revenue.
These variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets and can be based upon customer discretion.
We estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled.
We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable we will realize that amount.
Our estimates of variable consideration and our determination of its inclusion in project revenue for accounting purposes are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance and other information that may be available to us.
At a project level, we have specific practices and procedures to review our estimate of total revenue and cost.
Each project team reviews the progress and execution of our performance obligations, which impact the project’s accounting outcome.
As part of this process, the project team reviews information such as any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule and identified risks and opportunities.
The accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period depends on the accuracy of our project estimates, which can change from period to period for factors such as:•Complexity in original design;•Extent of changes from original design;•Different site conditions than assumed in our bid;•The productivity, availability and skill level of labor;•The technical maturity of the technologies involved;•Length of time to complete the project;•Availability and cost of equipment and materials;•Subcontractor and joint venture partner performance;•Expected costs of warranties; and•Our ability to recover for additional contract costs.We recognize changes in contract estimates on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the changes are identified.
Such changes in contract estimates can result in the recognition of revenue in a current period for performance obligations which were satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods.
Changes in contract estimates may also result in the reversal of previously recognized revenue if the current estimate adversely differs from the previous estimate.
If we estimate that a project will have costs in excess of revenue, we recognize the total loss in the period it is identified.Variable Consideration.
The nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including claims, unpriced change orders, award and incentive fees, liquidated damages and penalties.
We consider variable consideration in the development of our project forecasts so that our forecasted revenue reflects the amount of consideration we expect to be probable of recovering without a future significant reversal.
We estimate the amount of revenue attributable to variable consideration using the expected value method (i.e., the sum of a probability-weighted amount) or the most likely amount method, whichever offers better prediction.
Significant judgments are required in developing estimates for variable consideration.
Fair Value Measurements.
We are often required to use fair value measurement techniques with inputs that require the use of estimates and involve significant judgment.
These circumstances include:•Annual goodwill impairment testing of reporting units when quantitative analysis is deemed necessary•Impairment testing of intangible assets when impairment indicators are present•Impairment testing of investments as part of other than temporary impairment assessments when impairment indicators are present•Fair value assessments of businesses held for sale that are reported at fair value less cost to sell•Purchase price allocations for acquired businesses45Table of ContentsWhen performing quantitative fair value or impairment evaluations, we estimate the fair value of our assets by taking into consideration the results of both income-based and market-based valuation approaches.
Under the income approach, we prepare a discounted cash flow valuation model using recent forecasts and compare the estimated fair value of each asset to its carrying value.
Cash flow forecasts are discounted using the weighted-average cost of capital for the applicable reporting unit at the date of evaluation.
The weighted-average cost of capital is comprised of the cost of equity and the cost of debt with a weighting for each that reflects our current capital structure.
Preparation of long-term forecasts involve significant judgments involving consideration of our backlog, expected future awards, customer attribution, working capital assumptions, and general market trends and conditions.
Significant changes in these forecasts or any valuation assumptions, such as the discount rate selected, could affect the estimated fair value of our assets and could result in impairment charges.
Under the market approach, we consider market information such as multiples of comparable publicly traded companies and/or completed sales transactions to develop or validate our fair value conclusions, when appropriate and available.
During the third quarter of 2019, we performed quantitative testing of our goodwill, intangibles and other investments.
The majority of our goodwill resides in our Diversified Services reporting unit.
Based on the testing performed, the fair value of the Diversified Services reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill, by 20%.
All other factors being equal, a one hundred basis point increase in the discount rate used in the valuation would have resulted its fair value exceeding its carrying value by 7%.
During the third quarter of 2019, we recognized impairment charges of $257 million related to certain investments and $34 million related to customer relationship intangible assets.
All other factors being equal, a one hundred basis point change in the discount rates used in these valuations would have affected these impairments by $20 million and $4 million, respectively.
Restructuring Accruals.
We recognize and accrue restructuring related termination benefits when the recognition criteria in the applicable GAAP has been met, depending on the nature of the termination benefit.
Recognition of termination benefits requires the use of estimates in determining the expected termination benefits payable, when they are probable of being realized and can be reasonably estimated.
Our estimates consider the number of employees that we expect will be eligible to receive the benefit and the amount of benefit potentially payable to each employee based on either the terms of the plan or statutory entitlement.Recent Accounting PronouncementsRecent accounting pronouncements are discussed in our financial statements.Litigation and Matters in Dispute ResolutionLitigation and matters in dispute resolution are discussed in our financial statements.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesLiquidity is provided by available cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, credit facilities and access to capital markets, including the use of commercial paper.
We have both committed and uncommitted lines of credit available to be used for revolving loans and letters of credit.
As of December 31, 2019, our financial covenants limit our borrowings to approximately $1 billion under our committed credit facilities which expire in February 2022.
We believe that for at least the next 12 months, cash generated from operations, along with our unused credit capacity and cash position, is sufficient to support operating requirements.
However, we regularly review our sources and uses of liquidity and may pursue opportunities to increase our liquidity position.
Our committed credit facilities contain customary financial and restrictive covenants, including the timely filing of financial statements and a debt-to-capitalization ratio that cannot exceed 0.6 to 1.0.
In order to accommodate the delays in filing our financial statements, we have entered into amendments with our lenders to extend the deadline for filing this 2019 10-K to September 30, 2020 and to extend the first, second and third quarter deadlines to October 31, November 30 and December 31, 2020, respectively, and we believe that we will satisfy the extended deadlines.
Future losses and impairment charges could further reduce the amount of available credit capacity under our committed facilities.Cash FlowsCash and cash equivalents combined with marketable securities were $2.0 billion as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous accounts throughout the world to fund our global project execution activities.
Non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents amounted to $944 million and $964 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents exclude deposits of U.S. legal entities that are either swept into overnight, offshore accounts or invested in offshore, short-term time deposits, to which there is unrestricted access.In evaluating our liquidity needs, we consider cash and cash equivalents held by our consolidated variable interest entities (joint ventures and partnerships).
These amounts (which totaled $393 million and $392 million as of December 31, 46Table of Contents2019 and 2018, respectively, as reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet) were not necessarily readily available for general purposes.
We also consider the extent to which client advances (which totaled $69 million and $109 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively) are likely to be sustained or consumed over the near term for project execution activities and the cash flow requirements of our various foreign operations.
In some cases, it may not be financially efficient to move cash and cash equivalents between countries due to statutory dividend limitations and/or adverse tax consequences.
We did not consider any cash to be permanently reinvested overseas as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, other than unremitted earnings required to meet our working capital and long-term investment needs in foreign jurisdictions where we operate.

Working capital levels vary from year to year and are primarily affected by our volume of work.
These levels are also impacted by the stage of completion and commercial terms of engineering and construction projects, as well as our execution of our projects within budget.
Working capital requirements also vary by project and the payment terms agreed to with our clients, vendors and subcontractors.
Most contracts require payments as the projects progress.
We evaluate the counterparty credit risk of third parties as part of its project risk review process.
We maintain adequate reserves for potential credit losses and generally such losses have been minimal and within management's estimates.
Additionally, certain projects receive advance payments from clients.
A normal trend for these projects is to have higher cash balances during the initial phases of execution which then level out toward the end of the construction phase.
As a result, our cash position is reduced as customer advances are utilized, unless they are replaced by advances on other projects.
We maintain cash reserves and borrowing facilities to provide additional working capital in the event that a project's net operating cash outflows exceed our available cash balances.47Table of ContentsDuring 2019, working capital significantly decreased.
Specific factors related to the change in working capital include:•Decreases in accounts receivable which resulted primarily from normal billing and collections for several projects in the Mining & Industrial segment as well as the LOGCAP IV program in Afghanistan, now included in discontinued operations.•Decreases in contract assets which resulted primarily from normal project execution activities for several projects in the Energy & Chemicals and Infrastructure & Power segments.•Increases in contract liabilities resulting from loss provisions and forecast adjustments for several projects in the Energy & Chemicals and Other segments.Our working capital accounts as of December 31, 2018 reflect the adoption of ASC 606.
Excluding the non-cash impact of adopting ASC 606, working capital increased.
Specific factors related to the change in working capital include:•Increases in contract assets which resulted primarily from normal project execution activities on a large mining project and several infrastructure projects, partially offset by decreases in contract assets on several Energy & Chemicals projects.•A decrease in contract liabilities in the Energy & Chemicals segment, which resulted primarily from normal project execution activities on several large projects.•An increase in accounts payable in the Mining & Industrial segment, which resulted from normal invoicing activities on a large mining project.•A decrease in other current assets, driven primarily by the receipt of income tax refunds in 2018.During 2017, working capital decreased primarily due to decreases in accounts receivable and contract assets partially offset by an increase in prepaid income taxes and a decrease in accounts payable.
Specific factors related to these drivers include:•A decrease in accounts receivable, primarily related to collections from an Energy & Chemicals joint venture project in the United States.•A decrease in contract assets in the Energy & Chemicals segment, which resulted primarily from normal project execution activities.•A decrease in accounts payable in the Energy & Chemicals segment, which resulted primarily from normal invoicing and payment activities.The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2019 resulted from a higher level of working capital inflows compared to 2018.
The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2018 resulted primarily from a higher level of working capital outflows compared to 2017.We made income tax payments (net of refunds) of $204 million, $(28) million and $175 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Cash from operating activities is used to provide contributions to our defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans.
Contributions into the defined contribution plans during 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $115 million, $150 million and $165 million, respectively.
We contributed approximately $15 million, $45 million and $15 million into our defined benefit pension plans during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Company contributions to defined benefit pension plans during 2018 included additional funding required to execute a buy-in policy contract with an insurance company to fully insure the benefits of the plan in the United Kingdom.
In 2019, we approved the termination of the U.K. plan effective December 27, 2019 and the U.K. plan moved from "buy-in" to "buy-out" status, at which point the remaining benefit obligations were transferred to the insurer and we were relieved of any further obligation.
During 2019, we recorded a loss on pension settlement of $138 million, which consisted primarily of unrecognized actuarial losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss and did not have an impact on our cash position.
Assuming no changes in current assumptions, we expect to contribute up to $15 million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2020, which is expected to be in excess of the minimum funding required.
All periods included the operations of NuScale, which are primarily for research and development activities associated with the licensing and commercialization of small modular nuclear reactor technology.
NuScale expenses included in the determination of segment profit were $66 million, $74 million and $76 million during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
48Table of ContentsNuScale expenses for 2019, 2018 and 2017 were reported net of qualified reimbursable expenses of $44 million, $62 million and $48 million, respectively.
Investing ActivitiesWe hold cash in bank deposits and marketable securities which are governed by our investment policy.
This policy focuses on, in order of priority, the preservation of capital, maintenance of liquidity and maximization of yield.
These investments may include money market funds, bank deposits placed with highly-rated financial institutions, repurchase agreements that are fully collateralized by U.S.
Government-related securities, high-grade commercial paper and high quality short-term and medium-term fixed income securities.
Capital expenditures primarily related to construction equipment associated with the equipment business now included in discontinued operations, as well as expenditures for facilities and investments in information technology.
Proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment primarily related to the disposal of construction equipment associated with the equipment business in discontinued operations.In 2018, we sold our interest in a joint venture in the United Kingdom.
Investments in unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures in 2019 included capital contributions to two infrastructure joint ventures in the United States.
Investments in 2018 included capital contributions to an infrastructure joint venture in the United States as well as investments in COOEC Fluor.
Investments in 2017 included capital contributions to an Energy & Chemicals joint venture in the United States and investments in COOEC Fluor.
We have a future funding commitment to COOEC Fluor of $26 million due at the end of 2020. Financing ActivitiesWe have a common stock repurchase program, authorized by the Board of Directors, to purchase shares in the open market or privately negotiated transactions at our discretion.
In 2018, we repurchased 1,097,126 shares of common stock under our current and previously authorized stock repurchase programs.
As of December 31, 2019, 10,513,093 shares could still be purchased under the existing stock repurchase program.Quarterly cash dividends are typically paid during the month following the quarter in which they are declared.
Therefore, dividends declared in the fourth quarter of 2019 were paid in the first quarter of 2020.
Quarterly cash dividends of $0.21 per share were declared in 2018 and 2017 and in the first, second and third quarters of 2019.
Quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share were declared in the fourth quarter of 2019.
We have suspended our dividend as of April 29, 2020.
The payment and level of future cash dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors.
During the second and third quarters of 2018, we issued commercial paper to meet our short-term liquidity needs.
All of the outstanding commercial paper was repaid in October 2018.In August 2018, we issued $600 million of 4.250% Senior Notes (the “2018 Notes”) due September 15, 2028 and received proceeds of $595 million, net of underwriting discounts.
Interest on the 2018 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2019.
In September 2018, we used a portion of the proceeds from the 2018 Notes to fully redeem its $500 million 3.375% Senior Notes (the “2011 Notes”) due September 15, 2021.
The redemption price of $503 million was equal to 100 percent of the principal amount of the 2011 Notes plus a “make-whole” premium of $3 million.
Distributions paid to holders of NCI represent cash outflows to partners of consolidated partnerships or joint ventures created primarily for the execution of single contracts or projects.
Distributions in 2019 primarily related to a mining joint venture project in Chile.
Distributions in 2018 and 2017 primarily related to transportation joint venture projects in the United States.
Capital contributions by joint venture partners in 2019 primarily relates to initial investments from new partners in NuScale.Effect of Exchange Rate Changes on Cash During 2019 and 2017, most major foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar resulting in unrealized translation gains of $101 million and $110 million, respectively, of which $10 million and $51 million, respectively, related to cash held by foreign subsidiaries.
During 2018, most major foreign currencies weakened against the U.S. dollar resulting in unrealized translation losses of $117 million of which $62 million related to cash held by foreign subsidiaries.
The cash held in foreign currencies will primarily be used for project-related expenditures in those currencies, and therefore our exposure to exchange gains and losses is generally mitigated.49Table of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2019, letters of credit totaling $371 million were outstanding under our committed lines of credit, which consist of a $1.7 billion Revolving Loan and Letter of Credit Facility and a $1.8 billion Revolving Loan and Letter of Credit Facility.
Both facilities mature in February 2022.
Each of the credit facilities contain customary financial and restrictive covenants, including the timely filing of financial statements and a debt-to-capitalization ratio that cannot exceed 0.6 to 1.0 and a limitation on the aggregate amount of debt of the greater of $750 million or €750 million for our subsidiaries.
Borrowings under both facilities, which may be denominated in USD, EUR, GBP or CAD, bear interest at rates based on the Eurodollar Rate or an alternative base rate, plus an applicable borrowing margin.As of December 31, 2019, letters of credit totaling $1.0 billion were also outstanding under uncommitted lines of credit.Letters of credit are provided in the ordinary course of business primarily to indemnify our clients if we fail to perform our obligations under our contracts.
Surety bonds may be used as an alternative to letters of credit.Guarantees, Inflation and Variable Interest EntitiesGuaranteesIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into various agreements providing performance assurances and guarantees to our clients.
These agreements are entered into primarily to support project execution commitments.
The performance guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from mechanical completion of the project to a period extending beyond contract completion.
The maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under outstanding performance guarantees, which represents the remaining cost of work to be performed, was estimated to be $17 billion as of December 31, 2019.
Amounts that may be required to be paid in excess of estimated cost to complete contracts in progress are not estimable.
For cost reimbursable contracts, amounts that may become payable pursuant to guarantee provisions are normally recoverable from the client for work performed.
For lump-sum or fixed-price contracts, the performance guarantee amount is the cost to complete the contracted work, less amounts remaining to be billed to the client under the contract.
Remaining billable amounts could be greater or less than the cost to complete.
In those cases where costs exceed the remaining amounts payable under the contract, we may have recourse to third parties, such as owners, co-venturers, subcontractors or vendors for claims.
The performance guarantee obligation was not material as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.Financial guarantees, made in the ordinary course of business in certain limited circumstances, are entered into with financial institutions and other credit grantors and generally obligate us to make payment in the event of a default by the borrower.
These arrangements generally require the borrower to pledge collateral to support the fulfillment of the borrower's obligation.InflationAlthough inflation and cost trends affect our results, we mitigate these trends by seeking to fix our cost at or soon after the time of award on lump-sum or fixed-price contracts or to recover cost increases in cost reimbursable contracts.Variable Interest EntitiesWe frequently form joint ventures or partnerships with others primarily for the execution of single contracts or projects.
We assess our joint ventures and partnerships at inception to determine if any meet the qualifications of a VIE as defined in GAAP.
If a joint venture or partnership is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary, the joint venture or partnership is consolidated and our partners' interests are recognized as NCI.
For further discussion of our VIEs, see "Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" above and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.50Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsContractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 are summarized as follows: Payments Due by PeriodContractual ObligationsTotal1 year or less2–3 years4–5 yearsOver 5 years(in millions)

(2)Operating leases are primarily for engineering and project execution office facilities in various U.S and international locations, equipment used in connection with long-term construction contracts and other personal property.
Some of the operating leases are included in our discontinued operations.
(3)We generally provide funding to our international pension plans to at least the minimum required by applicable regulations.
In determining the minimum required funding, we utilize current actuarial assumptions and exchange rates to forecast estimates of amounts that may be payable for up to five years in the future.
In management's judgment, minimum funding estimates beyond a five-year time horizon cannot be reliably estimated.
Where minimum funding as determined for each individual plan would not achieve a funded status to the level of accumulated benefit obligations, additional discretionary funding may be provided from available cash resources.
(4)Principally deferred executive compensation.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskCash and marketable securities are deposited with major banks throughout the world.
Such deposits are placed with high quality institutions and the amounts invested in any single institution are limited to the extent possible in order to minimize concentration of counterparty credit risk.
Marketable securities may consist of time deposits, registered money market funds, U.S. agency securities, U.S. Treasury securities, commercial paper, non-U.S. government securities and corporate debt securities.
We have not incurred any credit risk losses related to deposits in cash and marketable securities.Certain of our contracts are subject to foreign currency risk.
We limit exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in most of our engineering and construction contracts through provisions that require client payments in currencies corresponding to the currency in which cost is incurred.
As a result, we generally do not need to hedge foreign currency cash flows for contract work performed.
However, in cases where revenue and expenses are not denominated in the same currency, we may hedge our exposure, if material and if an efficient market exists, as discussed below.We utilize derivative instruments to mitigate certain financial exposures, including currency and commodity price risk associated with engineering and construction contracts, currency risk associated with monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and risk associated with interest rate volatility.
As of December 31, 2019, we had total gross notional amounts of $804 million of foreign currency contracts (primarily related to the British Pound, Kuwaiti Dinar, Indian Rupee, Philippine Peso, South Korean Won, Canadian Dollar and Chinese Yuan) and $23 million of commodity contracts.
The foreign currency contracts are of varying duration, none of which extend beyond March 2022.
The commodity 51Table of Contentscontracts are of varying duration, none of which extend beyond December 2022.
Our historical gains and losses associated with foreign currency contracts have typically been immaterial, and have largely mitigated the exposures being hedged.
As of December 31, 2019, we had total gross notional amounts of $19 million associated with contractual foreign currency payment provisions that were deemed embedded derivatives.
We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.Our results reported by foreign subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are also affected by foreign currency volatility.
When the U.S. dollar appreciates against the non-U.S. dollar functional currencies of these subsidiaries, our reported revenue, cost and earnings, after translation into U.S. dollars, are lower than what they would have been had the U.S. dollar depreciated against the same foreign currencies or if there had been no change in the exchange rates.Our long-term debt obligations typically carry a fixed-rate coupon, and therefore, our exposure to interest rate risk is not material.
