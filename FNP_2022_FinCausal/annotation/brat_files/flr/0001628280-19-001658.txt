Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsIntroductionThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes.
For purposes of reviewing this document, "segment profit" is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests excluding: corporate general and administrative expense; interest expense; interest income; domestic and foreign income taxes; and other non-operating income and expense items.
For a reconciliation of total segment profit to earnings before taxes, see Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Results of OperationsConsolidated revenue was $19.2 billion, $19.5 billion and $19.0 billion during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
During 2018, a revenue decline in the Energy & Chemicals segment was partially offset by revenue growth in the Government segment.
Revenue in the Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power and Diversified Services segments remained flat compared to 2017.
The company adopted Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 606 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" on January 1, 2018.
The impact of adoption was an increase to the company’s revenue during 2018 of $132 million, primarily in the Energy & Chemicals segment.
See Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
During 2017, revenue growth in the Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power, Government and Diversified Services segments was partially offset by a revenue decline in the Energy & Chemicals segment.28Table of ContentsEarnings before taxes for 2018 increased 25 percent to $482 million from $386 million in 2017.
Earnings in 2018 were adversely affected by pre-tax charges totaling $361 million resulting from forecast revisions for estimated cost and schedule impacts on a fixed-price, gas-fired power plant project, a fixed-price downstream project and a fixed-price, offshore project.
These charges were partially offset by a gain of $125 million associated with the sale of the company’s interest in a joint venture in the United Kingdom.
Earnings in 2018 also benefitted from the adoption of ASC 606 which resulted in an increase to earnings before taxes of $134 million, primarily in the Energy & Chemicals segment.
Earnings in 2017 were adversely affected by pre-tax charges totaling $304 million resulting from forecast revisions for estimated cost growth at three fixed-price, gas-fired power plant projects in the southeastern United States and the downstream project mentioned above.
Excluding the adverse effects of forecast revisions in both 2018 and 2017, the gain on the sale of the joint venture interest in 2018 and the impact of adopting ASC 606, earnings in 2018 declined when compared to 2017.
Earnings declines in 2018 in the Energy & Chemicals; Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power; and Diversified Services segments were partially offset by an increase in earnings in the Government segment.
Earnings before taxes for 2017 decreased 29 percent to $386 million from $547 million in 2016.
Earnings in 2016 were adversely affected by pre-tax charges totaling $265 million related to forecast revisions for estimated cost increases on a petrochemicals project in the United States.
Apart from the adverse effects of the forecast revisions in both years, earnings in 2017 declined primarily in the Energy & Chemicals and Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segments.The effective tax rate was 39.2%, 31.6%, and 40.1% for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
The 2018 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted due to a $79 million increase in valuation allowances to reduce certain deferred tax assets.
The effective tax rate for 2017 was unfavorably impacted by a $37 million tax charge resulting from the enactment on December 22, 2017 of comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "2017 Tax Act"), as further discussed in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Apart from the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, the effective tax rate for 2017 benefited from the release of a deferred tax liability as a result of the restructuring of certain international operations and a worthless stock deduction for an insolvent foreign subsidiary.
These benefits were partially offset by the establishment of valuation allowances on certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards.
The 2016 rate was unfavorably impacted by foreign losses without a tax benefit and by an adjustment to deferred tax assets as a result of the issuance of U.S. Treasury regulations under Internal Revenue Code Section 987 for foreign currency translation gains and losses.
The unfavorable impact was partially offset by a benefit from the resolution of an IRS audit for tax years 2012 - 2013 and the domestic production activities deduction.
All periods benefitted from earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for which income taxes are not typically the responsibility of the company.Diluted earnings per share of $1.59 in 2018 included a gain of $0.74 per diluted share from the sale of the joint venture interest in the U.K. but was adversely affected by charges totaling $2.14 per diluted share resulting from forecast revisions at the aforementioned power plant project, downstream project and offshore project.
Diluted earnings per share in 2017 decreased to $1.36 from $2.00 in 2016.
Diluted earnings per share in 2017 was adversely affected by charges totaling $1.38 per diluted share resulting from forecast revisions for estimated cost growth at the three power plant projects and the downstream project mentioned above as well as the impact of U.S. tax reform legislation enacted in 2017 of $0.27 per diluted share.
Diluted earnings per share in 2016 was adversely affected by forecast revisions for estimated cost increases on the petrochemicals project mentioned above of $1.20 per diluted share.
The company's results reported by foreign subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are affected by foreign currency volatility.
When the U.S. dollar appreciates against the non-U.S. dollar functional currencies of these subsidiaries, the company's reported revenue, cost and earnings, after translation into U.S. dollars, are lower than what they would have been had the U.S. dollar depreciated against the same foreign currencies or if there had been no change in the exchange rates.The company's margins, in some cases, may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by a change in the amount of materials and customer-furnished materials, which are accounted for as pass-through costs.
As a result of adopting ASC 606 on January 1, 2018, engineering and construction contracts are now generally accounted for as a single unit of account (a single performance obligation), resulting in a more constant recognition of revenue and margin over the term of the contract than under the previous guidance in which the company typically segmented revenue and margin recognition between the engineering and construction phases of its contracts.
Prior to 2018, changes in the mix of work performed by the company had a larger impact, favorably or unfavorably, on the company's margins.
Segment profit margins were generally higher during the earlier stages of the project life cycle as project execution activities were more heavily weighted to higher margin engineering activities rather than lower margin construction activities, particularly when there was a significant amount of materials, including customer-furnished materials, recognized during construction.
For example, during 2017, margins in the company’s Energy & Chemicals segment were adversely affected by a shift in the mix of work from higher margin engineering activities to lower margin construction activities.Consolidated new awards in 2018 were $27.7 billion compared to $12.6 billion in 2017 and $21.0 billion in 2016.
The Energy & Chemicals and Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segments were the significant drivers of new award activity 29Table of Contentsduring 2018, including a liquefied natural gas export facility in Canada, a copper project in the south of Peru and an iron ore replacement mine in Australia.
All business segments contributed to the new award activity in 2017, including a mining project in Chile, a power restoration project in Puerto Rico, a contract extension for the LOGCAP IV program, a propylene oxide project in Texas and infrastructure projects in the United States and the Netherlands.
The Energy & Chemicals; Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power; and Government segments were the significant drivers of new award activity during 2016, including an award for the Tengiz Oil Expansion Project in Kazakhstan, which was awarded in the third quarter.
Approximately 80 percent of consolidated new awards for 2018 were for projects located outside of the United States compared to 53 percent for 2017.
Consolidated backlog was $40.0 billion as of December 31, 2018, $30.9 billion as of December 31, 2017, and $45.0 billion as of December 31, 2016.
The increase in backlog in 2018 primarily resulted from the new award activity discussed above.
The decrease in backlog in 2017 primarily resulted from the removal of two nuclear power plant projects for Westinghouse Electric Company LLC ("Westinghouse") and an adjustment to limit the contractual term of the Magnox nuclear decommissioning project in the United Kingdom (the "Magnox RSRL Project") to a five year term, as well as new award activity being outpaced by work performed.
As of December 31, 2018, approximately 71 percent of consolidated backlog related to projects located outside of the United States compared to 58 percent as of December 31, 2017.On March 1, 2016, the company acquired 100 percent of Stork Holding B.V. ("Stork") for an aggregate purchase price of €695 million (or approximately $756 million), including the assumption of debt and other liabilities.
Stork, based in the Netherlands, is a global provider of maintenance, modification and asset integrity services associated with large existing industrial facilities in the oil and gas, chemicals, petrochemicals, industrial and power markets.
The company paid €276 million (or approximately $300 million) in cash consideration.
The operations of Stork are reported in the Diversified Services segment below.
In February 2016, the company made an initial cash investment of $350 million in COOEC Fluor Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. ("CFHI"), a joint venture in which the company has a 49% ownership interest and Offshore Oil Engineering Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of China National Offshore Oil Corporation, has a 51% ownership interest.
Through CFHI, the two companies own, operate and manage the Zhuhai Fabrication Yard in China's Guangdong province.
The company made additional investments of $26 million, $26 million and $62 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and has a future funding commitment of $26 million that is expected to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2019.For a more detailed discussion of the operating performance of each business segment, corporate general and administrative expense and other items, see "— Segment Operations" and "— Corporate, Tax and Other Matters" below.Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The company's significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Estimates are based on information available through the date of the issuance of the financial statements and, accordingly, actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates.
Significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements apply to the following critical accounting policies:Engineering and Construction Contracts The company recognizes engineering and construction contract revenue over time, as performance obligations are satisfied, due to the continuous transfer of control to the customer.
Engineering and construction contracts are generally accounted for as a single unit of account (a single performance obligation) and are not segmented between types of services.
The company recognizes revenue using the percentage-of-completion method, based primarily on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost.
The percentage-of-completion method (an input method) is the most faithful depiction of the company’s performance because it directly measures the value of the services transferred to the customer.
Cost of revenue includes an allocation of depreciation and amortization.
Customer‑furnished materials, labor and equipment and, in certain cases, subcontractor materials, labor and equipment, are included in revenue and cost of revenue when management believes that the company is acting as a principal rather than as an agent (i.e., the company integrates the materials, labor and equipment into the deliverables promised to the customer).
Customer-furnished materials are only included in revenue and cost when the contract includes construction activity and the company has visibility into the amount the customer is paying for the materials or there is a reasonable basis for estimating the amount.
The company recognizes revenue, but not profit, on certain uninstalled materials that are not specifically produced, fabricated, or constructed for a project.
Revenue on these uninstalled materials is recognized when the cost is incurred (when control is transferred).
Changes to total estimated contract cost or losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined as assessed at the contract level.
Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred unless they are expected to be recovered from the client.
Project mobilization costs are generally charged to project costs as incurred when they are an integrated part of the performance obligation being transferred to the client.
Customer payments on engineering and construction contracts are typically due within 30 to 45 days of billing, depending on the contract.30Table of ContentsThe percentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition requires the company to prepare estimates of cost to complete for contracts in progress.
In making such estimates, judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule and the cost of materials, labor cost and productivity, the impact of change orders, liability claims, contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards.
As of December 31, 2018, 53 percent of the company's revenue backlog was reimbursable while 47 percent was for fixed-price or lump-sum contracts.
In certain instances, the company provides guaranteed completion dates and/or achievement of other performance criteria.
Failure to meet schedule or performance guarantees could result in unrealized incentive fees or liquidated damages.
In addition, increases in contract cost can result in non-recoverable cost which could exceed revenue realized from the projects.The nature of the company’s contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including claims and unpriced change orders; award and incentive fees; and liquidated damages and penalties.
The company recognizes revenue for variable consideration when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.
The company estimates the amount of revenue to be recognized on variable consideration using the expected value (i.e., the sum of a probability-weighted amount) or the most likely amount method, whichever is expected to better predict the amount.
Factors considered in determining whether revenue associated with claims (including change orders in dispute and unapproved change orders in regard to both scope and price) should be recognized include the following: (a) the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim, (b) additional costs were caused by circumstances that were unforeseen at the contract date and not the result of deficiencies in the company’s performance, (c) claim-related costs are identifiable and considered reasonable in view of the work performed, and (d) evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable.
If the requirements for recognizing revenue for claims or unapproved change orders are met, revenue is recorded only when the costs associated with the claims or unapproved change orders have been incurred.
Back charges to suppliers or subcontractors are recognized as a reduction of cost when it is determined that recovery of such cost is probable and the amounts can be reliably estimated.
Disputed back charges are recognized when the same requirements described above for claims accounting have been satisfied.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the company had recorded $166 million and $124 million, respectively, of claim revenue for costs incurred to date and such costs are included in contract assets.
Additional costs, which will increase the claim revenue balance over time, are expected to be incurred in future periods.
The company had also recorded disputed back charges totaling $18 million as of both December 31, 2018 and 2017.
The company believes the ultimate recovery of amounts related to these claims and back charges is probable in accordance with ASC 606.The company generally provides limited warranties for work performed under its engineering and construction contracts.
The warranty periods typically extend for a limited duration following substantial completion of the company’s work on a project.
Historically, warranty claims have not resulted in material costs incurred, and any estimated costs for warranties are included in the individual project cost estimates for purposes of accounting for long-term contracts.Backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress.
Although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm, cancellations, deferrals or scope adjustments may occur.
Backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, revisions to project scope and cost, foreign currency exchange fluctuations and project deferrals, as appropriate.
Consolidated backlog differs from the company’s remaining unsatisfied performance obligations ("RUPO") discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Backlog includes the amount of revenue the company expects to recognize under ongoing operations and maintenance contracts for the remainder of the current year renewal period plus up to three additional years if renewal is considered to be probable, while RUPO includes only the amount of revenue the company expects to recognize under ongoing operations and maintenance contracts with definite terms and substantive termination provisions.
Engineering and Construction Partnerships and Joint Ventures
 Certain contracts are executed jointly through partnership and joint venture arrangements with unrelated third parties.
Generally, these arrangements are characterized by a 50 percent or less, noncontrolling ownership or participation interest that requires only a small initial investment.
The arrangements are often formed for the single business purpose of executing a specific project and allow the company to share risks and secure specialty skills required for project execution.In accordance with ASC 810, "Consolidation," the company assesses its partnerships and joint ventures at inception to determine if any meet the qualifications of a variable interest entity ("VIE").
The company considers a partnership or joint venture a VIE if it has any of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, (b) characteristics of a controlling financial interest are missing (either the ability to make decisions through voting or other rights, the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity), or (c) the voting rights of the equity holders are not proportional to their obligations to absorb the expected losses of the entity and/or their rights to receive the expected residual returns of the entity, and substantially all of the entity's activities either involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights.
Upon the occurrence of certain events outlined in ASC 810, the company reassesses its initial determination of 31Table of Contentswhether the partnership or joint venture is a VIE.
The majority of the company's partnerships and joint ventures qualify as VIEs because the total equity investment is typically nominal and not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support.The company also performs a qualitative assessment of each VIE to determine if the company is its primary beneficiary, as required by ASC 810.
The company concludes that it is the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE if the company has both (a) the power to direct the economically significant activities of the entity and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
The company considers the contractual agreements that define the ownership structure, distribution of profits and losses, risks, responsibilities, indebtedness, voting rights and board representation of the respective parties in determining if the company is the primary beneficiary.
The company also considers all parties that have direct or implicit variable interests when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary.
As required by ASC 810, management's assessment of whether the company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE is continuously performed.For construction partnerships and joint ventures, unless full consolidation is required, the company generally recognizes its proportionate share of revenue, cost and profit in its Consolidated Statement of Earnings and uses the one-line equity method of accounting in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, which is a common application of ASC 810-10-45-14 in the construction industry.
The cost and equity methods of accounting are also used, depending on the company's respective ownership interest and amount of influence on the entity, as well as other factors.
At times, the company also executes projects through collaborative arrangements for which the company recognizes its relative share of revenue and cost.Deferred Taxes and Uncertain Tax Positions Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company's financial statements or tax returns.
The 2017 Tax Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017, significantly changed how the U.S. taxes corporations.
The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretations of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced.
The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered.
As future guidance is issued, the company may make adjustments to amounts that it has previously recorded that may materially impact the company's provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.As of December 31, 2018, the company had deferred tax assets of $673 million which were partially offset by a valuation allowance of $179 million and further reduced by deferred tax liabilities of $152 million.
The valuation allowance reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.
The valuation allowance for 2018 primarily relates to the deferred tax assets on certain net operating loss carryforwards in certain jurisdictions for U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries and U.S foreign tax credit carryforward.
The company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary.
The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company's forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.
Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the company's effective tax rate on future earnings.Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized.
Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met.
Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met.
The company recognizes potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within its global operations in income tax expense.Retirement Benefits
The company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with ASC 715-30, "Defined Benefit Plans — Pension."
As required by ASC 715-30, the unfunded or overfunded projected benefit obligation is recognized in the company's financial statements.
Assumptions concerning discount rates, long-term rates of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation levels are determined based on the current economic environment in each host country at the end of each respective annual reporting period.
The company evaluates the funded status of each of its retirement plans using these current assumptions and determines the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements, tax deductibility, reporting considerations and other factors.
Assuming no changes in current assumptions, the company expects to contribute up to $15 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2019, which is expected to be in excess of the minimum funding required.
If the discount rates were reduced by 25 basis points, plan liabilities for the defined benefit pension plans would increase by approximately $49 million.32Table of ContentsSegment OperationsThe company provides professional services in the fields of engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication and modularization, operations, maintenance and asset integrity, and project management, on a global basis and serves a diverse set of industries worldwide.
During the first quarter of 2018, the company changed the composition of its reportable segments to align them with the manner in which the chief executive officer manages the business and allocates resources.
The operations of the company’s mining and metals business, previously included in the Energy & Chemicals segment, have been included in the Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment.
The company now reports its operating results in the following four reportable segments: Energy & Chemicals; Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power; Government; and Diversified Services.
For more information on the business segments see "Item 1.
— Business" above.In the first quarter of 2019, services provided to the commercial nuclear market, as well as NuScale, will be moved from the Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment to the Government segment to align with the manner in which the chief executive officer intends to manage the business and allocate resources in 2019 and to better reflect the interaction of the commercial and government nuclear markets.Energy & ChemicalsRevenue and segment profit for the Energy & Chemicals segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31,(in millions)201820172016Revenue$7,698.2$8,565.8$9,250.0Segment profit337.2424.9366.4Revenue in 2018 decreased 10 percent compared to 2017, primarily due to reduced volume of project execution activity for several chemicals and downstream projects that were nearing completion in 2017.
This revenue decline was partially offset by an increase in project execution activities for a large upstream project.
Revenue in 2017 decreased 7 percent compared to 2016, primarily due to reduced volume of project execution activity for chemicals projects completed in 2016 or nearing completion in 2017, partially offset by an increase in construction activities for an upstream project and several downstream projects.Segment profit in 2018 and 2017 was adversely affected by charges totaling $133 million and $44 million, respectively, for estimated cost and schedule impacts on a fixed-price, downstream project.
The company is in the process of finalizing certain close-out matters with the customer, including final assessments of change orders and liquidated damages.
The company’s forecast is based on its assessment of the probable resolution of these close-out matters, which if not achieved, could result in additional adjustments.
Segment profit in 2018 was further affected by the reduced volume of project execution activity for several downstream projects that were nearing completion in 2017, as well as charges totaling $40 million resulting from forecast revisions for estimated cost growth on an offshore project.
These decreases in segment profit were largely offset by the favorable impact of the adoption of ASC 606.
Segment profit in 2016 was adversely affected by charges totaling $265 million resulting from cost growth on a petrochemicals project.
Normalizing for the adverse effects of the forecast revisions in 2017 and 2016, segment profit declined in 2017 due to lower volume of project execution activity for chemicals projects nearing completion and a continued shift in mix from higher margin engineering to lower margin construction activities.
Segment profit margin was 4.4 percent, 5.0 percent and 4.0 percent for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The changes in segment profit margin in 2018 and 2017 were primarily attributable to the same factors that affected revenue and segment profit.
New awards in the Energy & Chemicals segment were $10.6 billion, $4.0 billion and $6.9 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
New awards in 2018 included a liquefied natural gas export facility in Canada as well as an engineering and procurement contract for a refinery in Texas.
New awards in 2017 included an offshore project in the North Sea, a propylene oxide project in Texas, a petrochemical project in Malaysia and two refinery projects in Texas.
New awards in 2016 included an upstream project for the Tengiz Oil Expansion Project in Kazakhstan.
Backlog for the Energy & Chemicals segment was $17.8 billion as of December 31, 2018, $15.1 billion as of December 31, 2017 and $20.5 billion as of December 31, 2016.
The increase in backlog during 2018 resulted from the new award activity discussed above.
The reduction in backlog during 2017 resulted primarily from new award activity being outpaced by work performed.Total assets in the segment were $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2018 and $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2017.
Total assets as of December 31, 2018 included aged and disputed accounts receivable of $108 million related to a cost reimbursable, chemicals project in the Middle East.
As of February 2019, management continues to pursue collection of these amounts from the customer 33Table of Contentsand does not believe that the customer has a contractual basis for withholding payment.
The company does not believe it is probable that losses will be incurred in excess of amounts reserved for this matter.Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & PowerRevenue and segment profit for the Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31,(in millions)201820172016Revenue$5,186.1$5,178.4$4,598.7Segment profit (loss)(13.6)(141.0)170.9Revenue in 2018 remained flat compared to 2017.
Revenue growth from increased project execution activity for certain existing and recently awarded mining & metals and infrastructure projects was offset by reduced levels of project execution activity for several power projects, including two nuclear projects that were canceled during 2017.
Revenue in 2017 increased 13 percent compared to 2016 primarily due to increased project execution activity for several life sciences and advanced manufacturing projects and mining & metals projects, partially offset by reduced levels of project execution for the two nuclear projects.
Segment profit in 2018 was adversely affected by charges totaling $188 million resulting from forecast revisions for estimated cost growth at a fixed-price, gas-fired power plant project.
These charges were largely offset by a gain of $125 million associated with the sale of the company’s interest in a joint venture in the United Kingdom.
Segment profit in 2017 was adversely affected by charges totaling $260 million resulting from forecast revisions for estimated cost growth at three fixed-price, gas-fired power plant projects.
Excluding the adverse effects of forecast revisions in both 2018 and 2017 and the gain on the sale of the joint venture interest in 2018, segment profit in 2018 declined when compared to 2017.
This decline resulted primarily from the reduced volume of project execution activity for the power projects mentioned above, partially offset by the increased project execution activity for the mining & metals and infrastructure projects mentioned above.
Segment profit in 2017, excluding the impact of the forecast revisions mentioned above, declined when compared to 2016, primarily due to lower contributions from infrastructure projects.
Segment profit margins were (0.3) percent, (2.7) percent and 3.7 percent in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The change in segment profit margins in 2018 and 2017 were primarily attributable to the same factors impacting segment profit in those years.
The Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment includes the operations of NuScale, which are primarily research and development activities.
NuScale expenses, net of qualified reimbursable expenses, included in the determination of segment profit, were $74 million, $76 million and $92 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
New awards in the Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment were $10.8 billion, $4.0 billion and $7.7 billion during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
New awards in 2018 included a copper project in the south of Peru, an iron ore replacement mine in Australia, an international bridge project in Canada, a mine expansion project in Peru, and the Los Angeles International Airport Automated People Mover project.
New awards in 2017 included a mining project in Chile, the Southern Gateway project in Texas, the A10 Zuidasdok infrastructure project in Amsterdam and the Green Line Light Rail Extension project in Boston.
New awards in 2016 included the Purple Line Light Rail Transit project in Maryland, the Loop 202 South Mountain Freeway project in Arizona, the Port Access Road project in South Carolina, an award on a combined-cycle power plant in Greensville County, Virginia, a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility in North Carolina and a bauxite mine project in Guinea.
Backlog in the Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment was $15.3 billion as of December 31, 2018, $9.6 billion as of December 31, 2017 and $16.4 billion as of December 31, 2016.
The increase in backlog during 2018 primarily resulted from the new award activity discussed above.
The decrease in backlog during 2017 primarily resulted from the removal of two nuclear power plant projects for Westinghouse during 2017.Total assets in the Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment were $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2018 and $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2017.
The increase in total assets resulted from increased working capital assets in support of project execution activities.
Total assets in the Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment as of December 31, 2018 included accounts receivable related to the two subcontracts with Westinghouse to manage the construction workforce at two nuclear power plant projects in South Carolina ("V.C.
Summer") and Georgia ("Plant Vogtle").
On March 29, 2017, Westinghouse filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York.
In the third quarter of 2017, the V.C.
Summer project was canceled by the owner.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, the remaining scope of work on the Plant Vogtle project was transferred to a new contractor.
In addition to amounts due for post-petition services, total assets as of December 31, 2018 included amounts due of $66 million and $2 million for services provided to the V.C.
Summer and Plant Vogtle projects, respectively, prior to the date of the bankruptcy petition.
The company has filed mechanic's liens in South Carolina against the property of the owner of the V.C.
Summer project for amounts due for pre-petition services rendered to Westinghouse.
Based on the company's evaluation 34Table of Contentsof available information, the company does not expect the close-out of these projects to have a material impact on the company's results of operations.The company is currently in a dispute with a customer over costs totaling approximately $110 million that were allegedly incurred by the customer in connection with one of the gas-fired power plant projects discussed above.
The customer has withheld payment of certain invoices outstanding as of December 31, 2018 and drew down in January 2019 on a letter of credit issued on behalf of the company.
The company believes that certain of the customer’s claims are without merit and is vigorously pursuing recovery of the amounts from the customer.
Based upon its evaluation as of December 31, 2018, the company does not believe it is probable that a loss will be incurred in excess of amounts reserved for this matter.
GovernmentRevenue and segment profit for the Government segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31,(in millions)201820172016Revenue$3,772.0$3,232.7$2,720.0Segment profit178.6127.985.1Revenue in 2018 increased 17 percent compared to 2017, substantially driven by increased volume of project execution activities for a power restoration project in Puerto Rico, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2017 and was substantially completed in the first half of 2018.
Revenue growth in 2018 also resulted from an increase in hurricane relief efforts for the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency.
These increases in revenue in 2018 were partially offset by lower revenue resulting from the substantial completion of the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant project in late 2017.
Revenue in 2017 increased 19 percent compared to 2016 primarily due to increases in project execution activities for several large multi-year decommissioning and cleanup projects, as well as the commencement of the power restoration project in Puerto Rico.Segment profit in 2018 increased 40 percent compared to 2017, primarily due to the increased volume of project execution activities for the power restoration project and hurricane relief efforts discussed above.
Segment profit in 2017 increased 50 percent compared to 2016, substantially driven by increased contributions from multi-year decommissioning and cleanup projects and the commencement of the power restoration project discussed above.
Segment profit margins were 4.7 percent, 4.0 percent, and 3.1 percent in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The increases in segment profit margin in both 2018 and 2017 were primarily driven by the same factors that drove the increases in segment profit in both years.New awards were $4.1 billion, 2.6 billion and 4.6 billion during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
New awards in 2018 included a five-year extension of the management and operating contract of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a thirty-month extension at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant site, a contract extension for the LOGCAP IV program and a one-year extension at the Savannah River site.
New awards in 2017 included two awards related to the power restoration project in Puerto Rico and contract extensions for both the LOGCAP IV program and the management and operations of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve project.
New awards in 2016 included large awards for multi-year decommissioning and cleanup projects in the segment's environmental and nuclear business line.Backlog was $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2018, 3.8 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 5.2 billion as of December 31, 2016.
Total backlog included $2.9 billion, $741 million and $2.7 billion of unfunded government contracts as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The increase in backlog in 2018 primarily resulted from new award activity for several multi-year decommissioning and cleanup projects.
The decrease in backlog in 2017 primarily resulted from a customer decision to limit the contractual term of the Magnox RSRL Project to a five year term ending in August 2019.Total assets in the Government segment were $823 million as of December 31, 2018 compared to $732 million as of December 31, 2017.
The increase in total assets primarily resulted from increased working capital in support of project execution activities for several projects including the LOGCAP IV program in Afghanistan and the Radford Munition Facility.
For this latter project, the company is a subcontractor to a commercial client on a U.S. government project where the company’s forecast is based on its assessment of the probable resolution of certain change orders submitted to the client which are currently under discussion, and if not achieved, could adversely affect revenue and segment profit.35Table of ContentsDiversified ServicesRevenue and segment profit for the Diversified Services segment are summarized as follows: Year Ended December 31,(in millions)201820172016Revenue$2,510.3$2,544.1$2,467.8Segment profit99.6133.6121.9Revenue in 2018 remained relatively flat compared to 2017.
Revenue growth from Stork operations in Latin America and the staffing business were offset by the cancellation of a large operations and maintenance project in North America and revenue declines in the equipment and power services businesses.
Revenue in 2017 increased 3 percent compared to 2016, primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of revenue associated with the acquisition of the Stork business (which closed on March 1, 2016) compared to ten months during 2016, as well as revenue growth from the equipment business in North America.
The increase in revenue in 2017 was partially offset by a lower level of project execution activities in the power services business.Segment profit in 2018 decreased by 25 percent compared to 2017, primarily due to the cancellation of the large operations and maintenance project in North America and lower contributions from the equipment and power services businesses.
Segment profit in 2017 increased 10 percent compared to the prior year.
Increased contributions from the equipment business in North America were partially offset by lower contributions from the Stork business.
Segment profit margin was 4.0 percent, 5.3 percent and 4.9 percent for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The changes in segment profit margins in 2018 and 2017 were primarily due to the same factors affecting segment profit.New awards in the Diversified Services segment were $2.1 billion, 2.0 billion and 1.8 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Backlog was $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2018, 2.5 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2.9 billion as of December 31, 2016.
The reduction in backlog during 2018 resulted from scope changes on certain power services projects and the cancellation of the large operations and maintenance project in North America.
The reduction in backlog during 2017 resulted primarily from new award activity in the Stork and power services business being outpaced by work performed.
The equipment and temporary staffing businesses do not report backlog or new awards.Total assets in the Diversified Services segment were $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2018 compared to $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2017.Corporate, Tax and Other MattersCorporate For the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, corporate general and administrative expenses were $148 million, $192 million and $191 million, respectively.
The decrease in corporate general and administrative expenses during 2018 was primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains in the 2018 period compared to foreign currency exchange losses in the 2017 period, partially offset by a partial pension settlement charge of $22 million in 2018 (discussed in Note 7 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
Corporate general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat in 2017 compared to 2016.
During 2017, the company incurred foreign currency exchange losses, while recognizing foreign currency exchange gains in 2016.
The impact of the foreign currency losses was substantially offset by lower levels of organizational realignment expenses and compensation during 2017, as well as the inclusion of transaction and integration costs in 2016 associated with the Stork acquisition.
Net interest expense was $40 million, $40 million and $53 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
An increase in interest expense related to the issuance of $600 million of 4.250% Senior Notes in August 2018 and the payment of a make-whole premium associated with the redemption of $500 million of 3.375% Senior Notes in September 2018 (discussed in Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) was offset by an increase in interest income from time deposits.
The decrease in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in interest income resulting from time deposits entered into during the year as well as a decrease in interest expense resulting from the repayment of Stork's 11.0% Super Senior Notes and borrowings under a revolving line of credit.
Tax
The effective tax rate was 39.2%, 31.6%, and 40.1% for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Factors affecting the effective tax rates for 2016 - 2018 are discussed above under "— Results of Operations.
"Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.36Table of ContentsLitigation and Matters in Dispute ResolutionSee Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Liquidity and Financial ConditionLiquidity is provided by available cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, credit facilities and access to capital markets, including the use of commercial paper.
The company has both committed and uncommitted lines of credit available to be used for revolving loans and letters of credit.
The company believes that for at least the next 12 months, cash generated from operations, along with its unused credit capacity and cash position, is sufficient to support operating requirements.
However, the company regularly reviews its sources and uses of liquidity and may pursue opportunities to increase its liquidity position.
The company's financial strategy and consistent performance have earned it strong credit ratings, resulting in a competitive advantage and continued access to the capital markets.
As of December 31, 2018, the company was in compliance with all the financial covenants related to its debt agreements.Cash FlowsCash and cash equivalents were $1.8 billion as of both December 31, 2018 and 2017.
Cash and cash equivalents combined with current and noncurrent marketable securities were $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous accounts throughout the world to fund the company's global project execution activities.
Non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents amounted to $964 million and $919 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents exclude deposits of U.S. legal entities that are either swept into overnight, offshore accounts or invested in offshore, short-term time deposits, to which there is unrestricted access.In evaluating its liquidity needs, the company considers cash and cash equivalents held by its consolidated variable interest entities (joint ventures and partnerships).
These amounts (which totaled $392 million and $516 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet) were not necessarily readily available for general purposes.
In its evaluation, the company also considers the extent to which the current balance of its advance billings on contracts (which totaled $856 million and $874 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and is presented as “Contract liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet) is likely to be sustained or consumed over the near term for project execution activities and the cash flow requirements of its various foreign operations.
In some cases, it may not be financially efficient to move cash and cash equivalents between countries due to statutory dividend limitations and/or adverse tax consequences.
The company did not consider any cash to be permanently reinvested overseas as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and, as a result, has appropriately reflected the tax impact on foreign earnings in deferred taxes.Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities result primarily from earnings sources and are affected by changes in operating assets and liabilities which consist primarily of working capital balances for projects.
Working capital levels vary from year to year and are primarily affected by the company's volume of work.
These levels are also impacted by the stage of completion and commercial terms of engineering and construction projects, as well as the company's execution of its projects within budget.
Working capital requirements also vary by project and relate to clients in various industries and locations throughout the world.
Most contracts require payments as the projects progress.
The company evaluates the counterparty credit risk of third parties as part of its project risk review process.
The company maintains adequate reserves for potential credit losses and generally such losses have been minimal and within management's estimates.
Additionally, certain projects receive advance payments from clients.
A normal trend for these projects is to have higher cash balances during the initial phases of execution which then level out toward the end of the construction phase.
As a result, the company's cash position is reduced as customer advances are utilized, unless they are replaced by advances on other projects.
The company maintains cash reserves and borrowing facilities to provide additional working capital in the event that a project's net operating cash outflows exceed its available cash balances.The company’s working capital accounts as of December 31, 2018 reflect the adoption of ASC 606.
(See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
Excluding the non-cash impact of adopting ASC 606, working capital increased primarily due to an increase in contract assets and a decrease in contract liabilities partially offset by an increase in accounts payable during 2018.
Specific factors related to these drivers include:•An increase in contract assets, primarily driven by project execution activities in the Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment for certain mining & metals and infrastructure projects.•A decrease in contract liabilities in the Energy & Chemicals segment, which resulted primarily from normal project execution activities on several large projects.37Table of Contents•An increase in accounts payable in the Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment, which resulted from normal invoicing activities.•A decrease in other current assets, driven primarily by the receipt of income tax refunds in 2018.During 2017, working capital increased primarily due to an increase in prepaid income taxes and a decrease in accounts payable, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and contract assets.
Specific factors related to these drivers include:•A decrease in accounts payable in the Energy & Chemicals segment, which resulted primarily from normal invoicing and payment activities.•A decrease in accounts receivable, primarily related to collections from an Energy & Chemicals joint venture project in the United States.•A decrease in contract assets in the Energy & Chemicals segment, which resulted primarily from normal project execution activities.During 2016, working capital decreased primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and a decrease in joint venture net working capital partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and contract assets.
Specific factors related to these drivers include:•An increase in accounts payable in the Energy & Chemicals and Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segments which resulted from normal invoicing activities.•A decrease in the net working capital of a project joint venture in the Energy & Chemicals segment.•An increase in accounts receivable, primarily attributable to work performed for an Energy & Chemicals joint venture project in the United States.•An increase in contract assets in the Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment, which resulted primarily from normal project execution activities for two nuclear projects.Cash provided by operating activities was $162 million, $602 million and $706 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2018 resulted primarily from a higher level of working capital outflows during 2018 as compared to the prior year.
The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2017 was primarily driven by a decline in net working capital inflows and lower net earnings compared to 2016, partially offset by a decrease in deferred taxes.
The company made income tax payments (net of refunds) of ($28 million), $175 million and $165 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Cash from operating activities is used to provide contributions to the company's defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans.
Contributions into the defined contribution plans during 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $150 million, $165 million and $167 million, respectively.
The company contributed approximately $45 million into its defined benefit pension plans during 2018 and $15 million in both 2017 and 2016.
Company contributions to defined benefit pension plans during 2018 included additional funding required to execute a buy-in policy contract with an insurance company to fully insure the benefits of the plan in the United Kingdom.
Assuming no changes in current assumptions, the company expects to contribute up to $15 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2019, which is expected to be in excess of the minimum funding required.
The company does not anticipate any further material contributions to the U.K. plan.
As of December 31, 2018, the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded plan assets for certain defined benefit pension plans in the Netherlands, Germany and the Philippines.
As of December 31, 2017, the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded plan assets for certain defined benefit pension plans in the Netherlands and Germany.All periods included the operations of NuScale, which are primarily for research and development activities associated with the licensing and commercialization of small modular nuclear reactor technology.
NuScale expenses included in the determination of segment profit were $74 million, $76 million and $92 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
NuScale expenses for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were reported net of qualified reimbursable expenses of $62 million, $48 million and $57 million, respectively.
(See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of the cost-sharing agreements between NuScale and the U.S. Department of Energy.)
Investing ActivitiesCash provided by investing activities amounted to $1 million during 2018.
Cash utilized by investing activities amounted to $484 million and $741 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The primary investing activities included purchases, sales 38Table of Contentsand maturities of marketable securities; capital expenditures; disposals of property, plant and equipment; sales of and investments in partnerships and joint ventures; and business acquisitions.The company holds cash in bank deposits and marketable securities which are governed by the company's investment policy.
This policy focuses on, in order of priority, the preservation of capital, maintenance of liquidity and maximization of yield.
These investments may include money market funds, bank deposits placed with highly-rated financial institutions, repurchase agreements that are fully collateralized by U.S.
Government-related securities, high-grade commercial paper and high quality short-term and medium-term fixed income securities.
During 2018 and 2016, proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities exceeded purchases of such securities by $58 million and $162 million, respectively.
During 2017, purchases of marketable securities exceeded proceeds from sales and maturities of such securities by $21 million.
The company held combined current and noncurrent marketable securities of $215 million and $275 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Capital expenditures of $211 million, $283 million and $236 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily related to construction equipment associated with equipment operations in the Diversified Services segment, as well as expenditures for land, facilities and investments in information technology.
Proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment of $81 million, $96 million and $81 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily related to the disposal of construction equipment associated with the equipment operations in the Diversified Services segment.
During 2016, the company acquired 100 percent of Stork for an aggregate purchase price of €695 million (or approximately $756 million), including the assumption of debt and other liabilities.
The company paid €276 million (or approximately $300 million) in cash consideration.
The company borrowed €200 million (or approximately $217 million) under its $1.7 billion Revolving Loan and Letter of Credit Facility, and paid €76 million (or approximately $83 million) of cash on hand to initially finance the Stork acquisition.
The €200 million borrowed under the $1.7 billion Revolving Loan and Letter of Credit Facility was subsequently repaid from the net proceeds of the issuance of €500 million of 1.750% Senior Notes (the "2016 Notes") due March 21, 2023.In 2018, the company sold its interest in a joint venture in the United Kingdom and received proceeds of $125 million, net of expenses.
Investments in unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures were $73 million, $273 million and $518 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Investments in 2018 included capital contributions to an infrastructure joint venture in the United States as well as investments in CFHI.
Investments in 2017 and 2016 included capital contributions to an Energy & Chemicals joint venture in the United States and investments in CFHI.
The company has a future funding commitment to CFHI of $26 million that is expected to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2019.Financing ActivitiesCash utilized by financing activities during 2018, 2017 and 2016 of $140 million, $216 million and $10 million, respectively, included company stock repurchases, dividend payments to stockholders, proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and commercial paper, repayments of debt, borrowings and repayments under revolving lines of credit, and distributions paid to holders of noncontrolling interests.The company has a common stock repurchase program, authorized by the Board of Directors, to purchase shares in the open market or privately negotiated transactions at the company's discretion.
In 2018 and 2016, the company repurchased 1,097,126 shares and 202,650 shares of common stock, respectively, under its current and previously authorized stock repurchase programs resulting in cash outflows of $50 million and $10 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2018, 10,513,093 shares could still be purchased under the existing stock repurchase program.Quarterly cash dividends are typically paid during the month following the quarter in which they are declared.
Therefore, dividends declared in the fourth quarter of 2018 will be paid in the first quarter of 2019.
Quarterly cash dividends of $0.21 per share were declared in 2018, 2017 and 2016.
Dividends of $119 million were paid during 2018.
Dividends of $118 million were paid during both 2017 and 2016.
The payment and level of future cash dividends is subject to the discretion of the company's Board of Directors.In August 2018, the company issued $600 million of 4.250% Senior Notes (the “2018 Notes”) due September 15, 2028 and received proceeds of $595 million, net of underwriting discounts.
Interest on the 2018 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2019.
Prior to June 15, 2028, the company may redeem the 2018 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100 percent of the principal amount, plus a “make whole” premium described in the indenture.
On or after June 15, 2028, the company may redeem the 2018 Notes at 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption.In March 2016, the company issued the 2016 Notes and received proceeds of €497 million (or approximately $551 million), net of underwriting discounts.

Prior to September 15, 2024, the company may redeem the 2014 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100 percent of the principal amount, plus a "make whole" premium described in the indenture.
On or after September 15, 2024, the company may redeem the 2014 Notes at 100 percent of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption.For the 2018 Notes, the 2016 Notes and the 2014 Notes, if a change of control triggering event occurs, as defined by the terms of the respective indentures, the company will be required to offer to purchase the applicable notes at a purchase price equal to 101 percent of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption.
The company is generally not limited under the indentures governing the 2018 Notes, the 2016 Notes and the 2014 Notes in its ability to incur additional indebtedness provided the company is in compliance with certain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on liens and restrictions on sale and leaseback transactions.
The company may, from time to time, repurchase the 2018 Notes, the 2016 Notes and the 2014 Notes in the open market, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in such volumes, at such prices and upon such other terms as we deem appropriate.In September 2018, the company used a portion of the proceeds from the 2018 Notes to fully redeem $500 million of 3.375% Senior Notes (the “2011 Notes”) due September 15, 2021.
The redemption price of $503 million was equal to 100 percent of the principal amount of the 2011 Notes plus a “make-whole” premium of $3 million.
During the second and third quarters of 2018, the company issued commercial paper to meet its short-term liquidity needs.
All of the outstanding commercial paper was repaid in October 2018.In conjunction with the acquisition of Stork on March 1, 2016, the company assumed Stork’s outstanding debt obligations, including its 11.0% Super Senior Notes due 2017 (the ‘‘Stork Notes’’), borrowings under a €110 million Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, and other debt obligations.
On March 2, 2016, the company gave notice to all holders of the Stork Notes of the full redemption of the outstanding €273 million (or approximately $296 million) principal amount of Stork Notes plus a redemption premium of €7 million (or approximately $8 million) effective March 17, 2016.
The redemption of the Stork Notes was initially funded with additional borrowings under the company’s $1.7 billion Revolving Loan and Letter of Credit Facility, which borrowings were subsequently repaid from the net proceeds of the 2016 Notes.
Certain other outstanding debt obligations assumed in the Stork acquisition of €20 million (or approximately $22 million) were settled in March 2016.
In April 2016, the company repaid and replaced the €110 million Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility with a €125 million Revolving Credit Facility that was available to fund working capital in the ordinary course of business.
This replacement facility, which bore interest at EURIBOR plus .75%, expired in April 2017.
Outstanding borrowings of $53 million under the €125 million Revolving Credit Facility were repaid in the first quarter of 2017.Distributions paid to holders of noncontrolling interests represent cash outflows to partners of consolidated partnerships or joint ventures created primarily for the execution of single contracts or projects.
Distributions paid were $64 million, $47 million and $58 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Distributions in 2018, 2017 and 2016 primarily related to transportation joint venture projects in the United States.
Capital contributions by joint venture partners were $5 million, $6 million and $9 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Effect of Exchange Rate Changes on CashUnrealized translation gains and losses resulting from changes in functional currency exchange rates are reflected in the cumulative translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.
During 2018 and 2016, most major foreign currencies weakened against the U.S. dollar resulting in unrealized translation losses of $116 million and $103 million, respectively, of which $62 million and $54 million, respectively, related to cash held by foreign subsidiaries.
During 2017, most major foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar resulting in unrealized translation gains of $110 million, of which $51 million related to cash held by foreign subsidiaries.
The cash held in foreign currencies will primarily be used for project-related expenditures in those currencies, and therefore the company's exposure to exchange gains and losses is generally mitigated.40Table of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2018, the company had both committed and uncommitted lines of credit available to be used for revolving loans and letters of credit.
As of December 31, 2018, letters of credit and borrowings totaling $1.6 billion were outstanding under these committed and uncommitted lines of credit.
The committed lines of credit include a $1.7 billion Revolving Loan and Letter of Credit Facility and a $1.8 billion Revolving Loan and Letter of Credit Facility.
Both facilities mature in February 2022.
The company may utilize up to $1.75 billion in the aggregate of the combined $3.5 billion committed lines of credit for revolving loans, which may be used for acquisitions and/or general purposes.
Each of the credit facilities may be increased up to an additional $500 million subject to certain conditions, and contain customary financial and restrictive covenants, including a debt-to-capitalization ratio that cannot exceed 0.6 to 1.0 and a cap on the aggregate amount of debt of the greater of $750 million or €750 million for the company's subsidiaries.
Borrowings under both facilities, which may be denominated in USD, EUR, GBP or CAD, bear interest at rates based on the Eurodollar Rate or an alternative base rate, plus an applicable borrowing margin.In connection with the Stork acquisition, the company assumed a €110 million Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility that bore interest at EURIBOR plus 3.75%.
In April 2016, the company repaid and replaced the €110 million Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility with a €125 million Revolving Credit Facility which was used for revolving loans, bank guarantees, letters of credit and to fund working capital in the ordinary course of business.
This replacement facility, which bore interest at EURIBOR plus .75%, expired in April 2017.
Outstanding borrowings of $53 million under the €125 million Revolving Credit Facility were repaid in the first quarter of 2017.Letters of credit are provided in the ordinary course of business primarily to indemnify the company's clients if the company fails to perform its obligations under its contracts.
Surety bonds may be used as an alternative to letters of credit.Guarantees, Inflation and Variable Interest EntitiesGuaranteesIn the ordinary course of business, the company enters into various agreements providing performance assurances and guarantees to clients on behalf of certain unconsolidated and consolidated partnerships, joint ventures and other jointly executed contracts.
These agreements are entered into primarily to support the project execution commitments of these entities.
The performance guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from mechanical completion of the project being constructed to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances.
The maximum potential amount of future payments that the company could be required to make under outstanding performance guarantees, which represents the remaining cost of work to be performed by or on behalf of third parties under engineering and construction contracts, was estimated to be $19 billion as of December 31, 2018.
Amounts that may be required to be paid in excess of estimated cost to complete contracts in progress are not estimable.
For cost reimbursable contracts, amounts that may become payable pursuant to guarantee provisions are normally recoverable from the client for work performed under the contract.
For lump-sum or fixed-price contracts, the performance guarantee amount is the cost to complete the contracted work, less amounts remaining to be billed to the client under the contract.
Remaining billable amounts could be greater or less than the cost to complete.
In those cases where costs exceed the remaining amounts payable under the contract, the company may have recourse to third parties, such as owners, co-venturers, subcontractors or vendors for claims.
The company assessed its performance guarantee obligation as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 in accordance with ASC 460, "Guarantees," and the carrying value of the liability was not material.Financial guarantees, made in the ordinary course of business in certain limited circumstances, are entered into with financial institutions and other credit grantors and generally obligate the company to make payment in the event of a default by the borrower.
These arrangements generally require the borrower to pledge collateral to support the fulfillment of the borrower's obligation.InflationAlthough inflation and cost trends affect our results, the company mitigates these trends by seeking to fix the company's cost at or soon after the time of award on lump-sum or fixed-price contracts or to recover cost increases in cost reimbursable contracts.Variable Interest EntitiesIn the normal course of business, the company forms partnerships or joint ventures primarily for the execution of single contracts or projects.
The company evaluates each partnership and joint venture to determine whether the entity is a variable interest entity (“VIE”).
If the entity is determined to be a VIE, the company assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary and needs to consolidate the entity.For further discussion of the company's VIEs, see "Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" above and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.41Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsContractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 are summarized as follows: Payments Due by PeriodContractual ObligationsTotal1 year or less2–3 years4–5 yearsOver 5 years(in millions)

(2)Operating leases are primarily for engineering and project execution office facilities in Texas, California, the United Kingdom and various other U.S and international locations, equipment used in connection with long-term construction contracts and other personal property.
(3)Uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return may result in additional payments to tax authorities.
The total amount of the accrual for uncertain tax positions related to the company's effective tax rate is included in the "Over 5 years" column as the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments.
If a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments would not be necessary.
(4)The company generally provides funding to its international pension plans to at least the minimum required by applicable regulations.
In determining the minimum required funding, the company utilizes current actuarial assumptions and exchange rates to forecast estimates of amounts that may be payable for up to five years in the future.
In management's judgment, minimum funding estimates beyond a five-year time horizon cannot be reliably estimated.
Where minimum funding as determined for each individual plan would not achieve a funded status to the level of accumulated benefit obligations, additional discretionary funding may be provided from available cash resources.
(5)Principally deferred executive compensation.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskCash and marketable securities are deposited with major banks throughout the world.
Such deposits are placed with high quality institutions and the amounts invested in any single institution are limited to the extent possible in order to minimize concentration of counterparty credit risk.
Marketable securities consist of time deposits, registered money market funds, U.S. agency securities, U.S. Treasury securities, commercial paper, international government securities and corporate debt securities.
The company has not incurred any credit risk losses related to deposits in cash and marketable securities.Certain of the company's contracts are subject to foreign currency risk.
The company limits exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in most of its engineering and construction contracts through provisions that require client payments in currencies corresponding to the currency in which cost is incurred.
As a result, the company generally does not need to hedge foreign currency cash flows for contract work performed.
However, in cases where revenue and expenses are not denominated in the same currency, the company may hedge its exposure, if material and if an efficient market exists, as discussed below.42Table of ContentsThe company utilizes derivative instruments to mitigate certain financial exposures, including currency and commodity price risk associated with engineering and construction contracts, currency risk associated with monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and risk associated with interest rate volatility.
As of December 31, 2018, the company had total gross notional amounts of $557 million of foreign currency contracts (primarily related to the British Pound, Kuwaiti Dinar, Indian Rupee, Philippine Peso, South Korean Won and Chinese Yuan).
The foreign currency contracts are of varying duration, none of which extend beyond December 2021.
The company's historical gains and losses associated with foreign currency contracts have typically been immaterial, and have largely mitigated the exposures being hedged.
As of December 31, 2018, the company had total gross notional amounts of $31 million associated with contractual foreign currency payment provisions that were deemed embedded derivatives.
There were no commodity contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2018.
The company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.The company's results reported by foreign subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are also affected by foreign currency volatility.
When the U.S. dollar appreciates against the non-U.S. dollar functional currencies of these subsidiaries, the company's reported revenue, cost and earnings, after translation into U.S. dollars, are lower than what they would have been had the U.S. dollar depreciated against the same foreign currencies or if there had been no change in the exchange rates.The company's long-term debt obligations typically carry a fixed-rate coupon, and therefore, its exposure to interest rate risk is not material.
