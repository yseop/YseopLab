For hundreds of millions of consumers, Newell Brands makes life better every day, where they live, learn, work and play.
Business Strategy In 2018, Newell Brands announced its Accelerated Transformation Plan, which aims to accelerate value creation and more rapidly transform the portfolio to one best positioned to leverage the Company’s advantaged capabilities in innovation, design and e-commerce.
The Accelerated Transformation Plan is designed to significantly increase shareholder value through both strengthened operational and financial performance, while simultaneously deleveraging the balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders.
As part of the Company’s Accelerated Transformation Plan, during 2018, the Company announced it was exploring strategic options for its industrial and commercial product assets, including The Waddington Group, Process Solutions, Rubbermaid Commercial Products, Rexair and Mapa businesses, as well as non-core consumer businesses, including Rawlings, Jostens, Pure Fishing, Rubbermaid Outdoor, Closet, Refuse and Garage, Goody Products and U.S.
Playing Cards businesses.
These businesses are classified as discontinued operations at December 31, 2018.
Prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation.

(“Rawlings”) and Waddington Group, Inc. (“Waddington”) and various other subsidiaries as part of the Accelerated Transformation Plan.
The Company expects to complete the remaining divestitures by the end of 2019.
The Company expects to incur costs and expenses in connection with the transformation of the portfolio of businesses as part of the Accelerated Transformation Plan.

Ongoing Restructuring Initiatives Accelerated Transformation Plan The Company began restructuring and other actions in 2016 to integrate the legacy Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden businesses (the “Jarden Integration”).
Initially, integration projects were primarily focused on driving cost synergies in procurement, overhead functions and organizational changes designed to redefine the operating model of the Company from a holding company to an operating company.
Subsequently, the Company announced its Accelerated Transformation Plan during the first quarter of 2018 to divest of the Company’s industrial and commercial product assets and non-core consumer businesses.
The Accelerated Transformation Plan continues some of the Jarden Integration projects for the continuing operations and focuses on the realignment of the Company’s management structure and overall cost structure as a result of the completed and planned divestitures.
Restructuring costs associated with integration projects and the transformation plan include employee-related cash costs, including severance, retirement and other termination benefits, and contract termination and other costs.
In addition, other costs associated with the Jarden Integration include advisory and personnel costs for managing and implementing integration projects.
Project Renewal The Company’s Project Renewal restructuring plan was completed during 2017.
Project Renewal was designed, in part, to simplify and align the Company’s businesses, streamline and realign the supply chain functions, reduce operational and manufacturing complexity, streamline the distribution and transportation functions, optimize global selling and trade marketing functions and rationalize the Company’s real estate portfolio.
See Footnote 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Impacts of Tariffs The current U.S. presidential administration has implemented new U.S. tariffs that could impact the level of trade between the U.S and Canada, China, and the European Union in addition to global commerce in general.
U.S. trading partners such as Canada, China and the European Union have responded by announcing retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. exports.
Tariffs on imports into the U.S. and exports to Canada, China and the European Union will increase costs for the Company.
The Company has been successful at negotiating an exception for most of the U.S. tariffs planned on baby gear, which represents a substantial portion of the Company’s tariff exposure.
However, the U.S. government has announced its intention to increase some of the China tariffs from 10% to 25% if there is not a breakthrough in negotiations with the China government.
The Company’s annualized gross tariff cost exposure from all these actions is estimated at approximately $105 million.
The Company is working to mitigate the tariff exposure, in part through pricing, productivity and in some cases relocation.
In addition, if the U.S. presidential administration were to extend the tariffs to additional categories of goods made in China it could have a significant impact on the Company.

The decrease in cost of products sold for 2018 was primarily driven by the impact of the 2017 divestitures (approximately $187 million) and lower sales (approximately $340 million) and impact of the adoption of new revenue recognition standards (approximately $184 million), partially offset by the impact of acquisitions (approximately $58 million).
Reported gross margin was 34.9% versus 34.2% as the benefit from pricing, product mix and cost savings was mostly offset by the impact of inflation related to cost of goods, freight and tariffs.
The decrease in SG&A for 2018 was primarily due the impact of the 2017 divestitures (approximately $78 million), a decrease in integration cost (approximately $133 million), as well as the benefits of cost savings.
The restructuring costs for 2018 and 2017 were mostly comprised of costs related to the Accelerated Transformation Plan, primarily consisting of severance costs.
During 2018, in connection with the Company’s annual impairment testing and subsequent triggering events, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $8.3 billion to reflect impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.
The impairment charge affected the Company’s reporting segments as follows (in millions): Year EndedDecember 31, 2018 Goodwill Intangibles Food and Appliances $ 1,766.9 $ 1,746.7 Home and Outdoor Living 1,985.0 2,434.1 Learning and Development 105.3 246.0 $ 3,857.2 $ 4,426.8 See Footnote 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding impairment charges In addition to the impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, during 2018, the Company recorded $38.0 million of impairment charges on certain other assets, the majority of which relate to the Home Fragrance business in the Home and Outdoor Living segment.
Consolidated operating income (loss) as a percentage of net sales for 2018 and 2017 was approximately (90.7)% and 4.0%, respectively.
The change is primarily due to increased impairment charges and the negative impact of lower sales, partially offset by synergies and cost savings, lower integration and acquisition-related costs and decreased restructuring costs.
24 Table of Contents The decrease in interest expense for 2018 was primarily due to lower debt levels.
The weighted average interest rate for 2018 and 2017 was approximately 4.2% and 4.0%, respectively.

Operating income (loss) as a percentage of net sales for 2018 and 2017 was approximately (122)% and 10.7%.
The decrease was primarily driven by impairment charges, the negative impact of lower sales and cost of goods and freight inflation.
Home and Outdoor Living The decrease in net sales for 2018 was primarily driven by decline in the Outdoor & Recreation and Home Fragrance businesses, primarily due to lost distribution in the certain product categories and continuing declines in the Home Fragrance retail channel, unfavorable weather conditions affecting the Coleman business; and the impact of the adoption of new revenue recognition standard, partially offset by improved sales in Connected Home & Security.
Home Fragrance was burdened by continued sales declines at certain of the mall-based Yankee Candle retail stores.
The Company intends to exit unprofitable mall-based retail stores as their leases expire.
Operating income (loss) as a percentage of net sales for 2018 and 2017 was approximately (144)% and 8.8%, respectively.
The decrease was primarily driven by impairment charges.
Learning and Development The decrease in net sales for 2018 was primarily due to a decline in the Writing business related to significant inventory contraction in the U.S. office superstore and distributive trade channels, sales declines in the baby gear category largely attributable to the bankruptcy and liquidation of a top global customer of the Baby division, partially offset by a revenue shift to other major retailers; and the impact of the adoption of new revenue recognition standards.
Operating income as a percentage of net sales for 2018 and 2017 was approximately 8.0% and 16.5%, respectively.
The decrease was primarily driven by impairment charges, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A and productivity savings.
Other The decrease in net sales for 2018 was due to impact of the 2017 divestitures.
The change in operating income (loss) for 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to impairment charges and other costs incurred during 2017, related to the 2017 divestitures and assets held for sale.

Foreign currency impacts on a period-over-period basis were not material.
The change in cost of products sold for 2017 was primarily due to the Jarden Acquisition, as well as other acquisitions (approximately $910 million) and the impact of increased sales and unfavorable foreign currency (collectively approximately $90 million), partially offset by inventory step-up charges primarily related to the Jarden Acquisition recorded in 2016 (approximately $293 million) and the impact of divestitures (approximately $632 million).
Gross margin was 34.2% versus 32.4% percent in 2016.
The change was primarily due to the impact of the inventory step-up charge recorded in 2016 and the benefits of synergies and productivity, partially offset by the negative mix effects partially related to the Jarden Acquisition.
The change in SG&A for 2017 was primarily due to the Jarden Acquisition, as well as other acquisitions (approximately $305 million) and increased investment related to brand development, e-commerce and insights, partially offset by the impact of divestitures (approximately $230 million) and benefits of synergies and productivity.
Additionally, the decrease in certain labor-related costs was mostly offset by an increase in integration costs.
The restructuring costs for 2017 were mostly comprised of costs related to the Jarden Integration and other restructuring activities, which primarily relate to the Jarden Acquisition.
The majority of the restructuring costs for 2016 related to Project Renewal.
Consolidated operating income as a percentage of net sales for 2017 and 2016 was approximately 4.0% and 3.3%, respectively.
The decrease in aforementioned inventory step-up charge related to the Jarden Acquisition, the impact of increased net sales and the benefits of synergies and productivity, as well as a reduction in bonus expense, were mostly offset by the negative mix effects related to the Jarden Acquisition, increased investment related to the expansion of brand development, e-commerce and insights, as well as costs associated with the delivery of synergies, the increase in the impairment of goodwill, intangibles and other assets and the acquisition-related increase in amortization of intangibles.
The increase in interest expense for 2017 was primarily due to higher average debt levels versus the same prior year period.
The weighted average interest rate for 2017 and 2016 was approximately 4.0% and 3.7%, respectively.
As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the United States, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $1.5 billion due to statutory tax rate changes in the United States and an $87.2 million tax benefit to reverse the Company’s APB 23 liability on historical Jarden earnings, partially offset by a $195 million tax expense relating to a mandatory repatriation tax.

Operating income as a percentage of net sales for 2017 and 2016 was approximately 10.7% and 7.8%, respectively.
The increase was primarily driven by the impact of the 2016 inventory step-up charge related to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately $118 million) and a reduction in bonus expense, which more than offset the negative product mix impact of the Jarden Acquisition, and the acquisition-related increase in amortization of intangibles, as well as the impact of incremental promotional activity.
Home and Outdoor Living The increase in net sales for 2017 was primarily due to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately 34%), with the balance of growth generated primarily by the Beverage, Coleman and Technical Apparel categories.
Operating income as a percentage of net sales for 2017 and 2016 was approximately 8.8% and 7.3%, respectively.
The increase was primarily driven by the impact of the 2016 inventory step-up charge related to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately $140 million), cost synergies, and a reduction in bonus expense.
Learning and Development The increase in net sales for 2017 was primarily due to an increase in sales in the Writing business, in part due to increases in Elmer’s glue sales and strong growth in the baby gear category partially offset by decreases in other Writing categories due to inventory reductions at certain mass market retailers and a decline in the Fine Art category.
Operating income as a percentage of net sales for 2017 and 2016 was approximately 16.5% and 19.6%, respectively.
The decrease was primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of product mix due to the growth of Elmer’s glue sales within the Writing business, increased advertising and promotion costs, and fire-related losses at a Writing warehouse in Mexico.
Other The decrease in net sales for 2017 was primarily due to impact of divestitures.
Operating earnings (loss) as a percentage of net sales for 2017 and 2016 was approximately (36.1%) and 8.5%, respectively.
The change was affected by an increase in the impairment of goodwill, intangibles and other assets (approximately $70 million), the impact of divestitures, and other costs that are primarily related to assets held for sale, partially offset by the impact of the 2016 inventory step-up charge related to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately $34 million).
27 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $496 million, of which approximately $308 million was held by the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries.
Overall, the Company believes that available cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated from future operations, access to capital markets, and availability under its revolving credit facility and receivables purchase agreement will be adequate to support the cash needs of the Company.
The Company intends to use available cash, borrowing capacity, cash flows from future operations and alternative financing arrangements to invest in capital expenditures in support of the Company’s growth platforms, to maintain its dividend per share and to repay debt maturities as they come due and to complete its ongoing restructuring initiatives.
Cash and cash equivalents changed as follows for 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions): Increase (Decrease) Continuing Operations 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 Cash provided by operating activities $ 524.1 $ 834.4 $ 1,668.3 $ (310.3 ) $ (833.9 ) Cash provided by (used in) investing activities (176.5 ) 1,216.1 (8,662.7 ) (1,392.6 ) 9,878.8 Cash provided by (used in) financing activities (5,453.8 ) (2,194.4 ) 7,332.3 (3,259.4 ) (9,526.7 ) Discontinued Operations Cash provided by operating activities $ 155.9 $ 131.8 $ 172.1 $ 24.1 $ (40.3 ) Cash provided by (used in) investing activities 4,983.9 (137.6 ) (162.1 ) 5,121.5 24.5 Cash used in financing activities (0.7 ) (1.4 ) (3.8 ) 0.7 2.4 Total Company Cash provided by operating activities $ 680.0 $ 966.2 $ 1,840.4 $ (286.2 ) $ (874.2 ) Cash provided by (used in) investing activities 4,807.4 1,078.5 (8,824.8 ) 3,728.9 9,903.3 Cash provided by (used in) financing activities (5,454.5 ) (2,195.8 ) 7,328.5 (3,258.7 ) (9,524.3 ) Currency effect on cash and cash equivalents (22.9 ) 49.3 (31.4 ) (72.2 ) 80.7 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 10.0 $ (101.8 ) $ 312.7 $ 111.8 $ (414.5 ) The Company tends to generate the majority of its operating cash flow in third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal variations in operating results, the timing of annual performance-based compensation payments, working capital requirements and credit terms provided to customers.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities The change in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations is in part due to an increase in cash taxes paid (approximately $135 million) related to the gain on the sale of the Tools business, lower payables in 2018 and favorable working capital benefits in 2017 related to the divested businesses, partially offset by strong inventory management and other working capital initiatives and timing, as well as lower bonus and incentive payments.
The change in net cash provided by continuing operations for 2017 is in part due to operating cash flows that were unusually high in 2016 driven by substantial benefits that did not repeat related to the Jarden Acquisition, including the absence of seasonal cash outflows for the legacy Jarden businesses, prior to the transaction; an increase in cash interest paid (approximately $143 million); an increase in make-whole interest and fees related to the extinguishment of debt (approximately $34 million); an increase in integration-related costs (approximately $137 million), an increase in cash taxes paid (approximately $73 million) and unfavorable working capital movements primarily related to the timing of inventory purchases.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities The change in cash provided by (used in) investing activities from continuing operations was primarily due to a decrease in the proceeds from the sale of businesses (approximately $2.1 billion), partially offset by a decrease in cash used for the acquisition of businesses (approximately $634 million).
For 2018 and 2017, capital expenditures from continuing operations were $229 million and $266 million, respectively.
The change in cash provided by (used in) investing activities from continuing operations for 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in cash used for the acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired (approximately $8 billion), primarily due to the Jarden Acquisition and a $1.9 billion increase in the proceeds from the sale of businesses.
For 2017, capital expenditures from continuing operations were $266 million versus $292 million for 2016.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities The change in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities from continuing operations was primarily due to the period-over-period decrease in borrowings on short-term debt (approximately $1.0 billion), an increase in shares repurchased (approximately $1.4 billion), and an increase in the payments on long-term debt (approximately $1.1 billion), partially offset by non-repeating payments to dissenting shareholders in 2017 (approximately $162 million).
28 Table of Contents The change in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities from continuing operations for 2017 was primarily due to the decrease in the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, primarily used to fund the Jarden Acquisition, in excess of payments on long-term debt (approximately $9.8 billion) an increase in cash dividends paid (approximately $100 million), an increase in the repurchase of shares of the Company (approximately $152 million) and cash paid to dissenting former Jarden shareholders (approximately $162 million), partially offset by the period-over-period increase in the net change in short-term debt (approximately $753 million).
Capital Resources In September 2018, the Company redeemed the entire principal amount of its 2.15% senior notes due 2018 at a price approximating par value.
In October 2018, the Company commenced cash tender offers (the “Tender Offers”) totaling approximately $1.0 billion for any and all of its 2.875% senior notes due 2019 (the “2.875% Notes”) and up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of its 3.15% senior notes due 2021 (the “3.15% Notes”), 3.85% senior notes due 2023 and 4.20% senior notes due 2026.
In October 2018, pursuant to the Tender Offers, the Company repurchased approximately $249 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.875% Notes due 2019 and approximately $650 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.15% Notes due 2021 for total consideration, excluding accrued interest, of approximately $893 million.
In October 2018, the Company also instructed the trustee for the 2.875% Notes to deliver an irrevocable notice of redemption to the holders of the 2.875% Notes for any and all of the 2.875% Notes not tendered in the Tender Offers.
Pursuant to the notice of redemption, the Company redeemed the entire aggregate principal amount of the 2.875% Notes outstanding on November 9, 2018, at the redemption price determined in accordance with the terms for redemption set forth in the 2.875% Notes and the indenture governing the 2.875% Notes.
In December, 2018, the Company commenced an additional cash tender (the “Second Tender Offer”) totaling approximately $1.6 billion for any and all of its 3.15% Notes due 2021 and up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of certain other of its senior notes.
In December, 2018, pursuant to the Second Tender Offer, the Company repurchased approximately $252 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.15% Notes, approximately $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of its 5.5% senior notes due 2046, approximately $209 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.9% senior notes due 2025 and approximately $80 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.375% senior notes due 2036, for total consideration, excluding accrued interest, of approximately $1.6 billion.
As a result of these debt extinguishments, the Company recorded a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $4.1 million, primarily comprised of a non-cash charge due to the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs, partially offset by prepayment gains.
The Company maintains a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility that matures in December 2023 (the “Facility”).
Under the Facility, the Company may borrow funds on a variety of interest rate terms.
Since the Facility provides the committed backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper, the Company may issue commercial paper up to a maximum of $800 million provided there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the Facility.
The Facility also provides for the issuance of up to $100 million of letters of credit, so long as there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the Facility.
At December 31, 2018, there was no commercial paper outstanding, there were approximately $30 million of outstanding standby letters of credit issued against the Facility and there were no borrowings outstanding under the Facility.
The net availability under the Facility was approximately $1.2 billion.
The Company maintains a $950 million receivables purchase agreement that matures in October 2019 (the “Securitization Facility”) and bears interest at a margin over a variable interest rate.
At December 31, 2018, the borrowing rate margin and the unused line fee on the Securitization Facility were 0.80% and 0.40% per annum, respectively.
At December 31, 2018, net availability under the Facility was approximately $761 million.
The Company was not in default of any of its debt covenants at December 31, 2018.
At December 31, 2018, there were approximately 2.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock that had not been issued and $61 million in cash that had not been paid to the former holders of Jarden shares who are exercising their right to judicial appraisal under Delaware law.
Absent consent by the Company, these dissenting shareholders are no longer entitled to the merger consideration, but are instead entitled only to the judicially determined fair value of their shares, plus interest accruing from the date of the Jarden Acquisition, payable in cash.
However, it is possible that the Company could issue a consent to or reach agreement with one or more of these shareholders resulting in the issuance of Company shares (in lieu of or along with the payment of cash) in settlement of the dissenters’ claims.
At December 31, 2018, the Company has accrued approximately $171 million of unpaid consideration related to these former shares of Jarden common stock.
29 Table of Contents On June 11, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a $2.5 billion increase in the then available amount under its existing Stock Repurchase Program (“SRP”).
Under the updated SRP, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to approximately $3.6 billion of its outstanding shares through the end of 2019.
The repurchase of additional shares in the future will depend upon many factors, including the Company’s financial condition, liquidity and legal requirements.
During 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 63 million shares of its common stock valued at approximately $1.5 billion under the SRP.
At December 31, 2018, approximately $2.1 billion remains available under the SRP.
On February 20, 2019, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) concluded its review of its rating of Newell Brands Inc. and has downgraded the Company’s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating to ‘BB+’ from ‘BBB-’ and Short-Term IDR to ‘B’ from ‘F3’.
The Rating Outlook is Stable.
This action reflected Fitch’s view that recent declines in business performance expectations and risks associated with completion of the Accelerated Transformation Plan could indicate execution issues and share losses.
Risk Management From time to time, the Company enters into derivative transactions to hedge its exposures to interest rate, foreign currency rate and commodity price fluctuations.
The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes.
Interest Rate Contracts The Company manages its fixed and floating rate debt mix using interest rate swaps.
The Company may use fixed and floating rate swaps to alter its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on its consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest.
Floating rate swaps would be used, depending on market conditions, to convert the fixed rates of long-term debt into short-term variable rates.
Fixed rate swaps would be used to reduce the Company’s risk of the possibility of increased interest costs.
Interest rate swap contracts are therefore used by the Company to separate interest rate risk management from the debt funding decision.
The cash paid and received from the settlement of interest rate swaps is included in interest expense.
Fair Value Hedges At December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $527 million notional amount of interest rate swaps that exchange a fixed rate of interest for variable rate (LIBOR) of interest plus a weighted average spread.
These floating rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges against $277 million of principal on the 4.7% senior notes due 2020 and $250 million of principal on the 4.0% senior notes due 2024 for the remaining life of these notes.
The effective portion of the fair value gains or losses on these swaps is offset by fair value adjustments in the underlying debt.
Cross-Currency Contracts The Company uses cross-currency swaps to hedge foreign currency risk on certain intercompany financing arrangements with foreign subsidiaries.
During 2018, all of the Company’s cross-currency interest rate swaps matured.
The cross-currency interest rate swaps were intended to eliminate uncertainty in cash flows in U.S.
Dollars and British Pounds in connection with the intercompany financing arrangements.
Foreign Currency Contracts The Company uses forward foreign currency contracts to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate exposure on the cash flows related to forecasted inventory purchases and sales and have maturity dates through December 2019.
The derivatives used to hedge these forecasted transactions that meet the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The effective portion of the gains or losses on these derivatives is deferred as a component of AOCI and is recognized in earnings at the same time that the hedged item affects earnings and is included in the same caption in the statements of operations as the underlying hedged item.
At December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $504 million notional amount outstanding of forward foreign currency contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted inventory purchases and sales.
The Company also uses foreign currency contracts, primarily forward foreign currency contracts, to mitigate the foreign currency exposure of certain other foreign currency transactions.
At December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $1.0 billion notional amount outstanding of these foreign currency contracts that are not designated as effective hedges for accounting purposes and have maturity dates through October 2020.
Fair market value gains or losses are included in the results of operations and are classified in other (income) expense, net.
30 Table of Contents The following table presents the fair value of derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2018 (in millions): December 31,2018 Asset(Liability) Derivatives designated as effective hedges: Cash flow hedges: Foreign currency contracts $ 12.6 Fair value hedges: Interest rate swaps (11.5 ) Derivatives not designated as effective hedges: Foreign currency contracts 8.7 Commodity contracts (0.9 ) Total $ 8.9 Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has outstanding debt obligations maturing at various dates through 2046.
Certain other items, such as purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized as liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed.
Examples of items not recognized as liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of December 31, 2018, and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements.
The following table summarizes the effect that lease and other material contractual obligations is expected to have on the Company’s cash flow in the indicated period.
In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2018.
Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements: Year(s) (in millions) Total 1 2-3 4-5 After 5 Debt (1) $ 7,057.1 $ 269.4 $ 806.5 $ 2,301.9 $ 3,679.3 Interest on debt (2) 2,693.0 302.2 570.2 476.5 1,344.1 Operating lease obligations (3) 877.4 180.0 261.8 171.7 263.9 Purchase obligations (4) 392.3 303.9 76.9 11.4 0.1 Tax obligations (5) 118.1 10.5 20.5 29.5 57.6 Total (6) $ 11,137.9 $ 1,066.0 $ 1,735.9 $ 2,991.0 $ 5,345.0 (1) Amounts represent contractual obligations based on the earliest date that the obligation may become due, excluding interest, based on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2018.
For further information relating to these obligations, see Footnote 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
(2) Amounts represent estimated interest payable on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2018, excluding the impact of fixed to floating rate interest rate swaps.
Interest on floating-rate debt was estimated using the rate in effect as of December 31, 2018.
For further information, see Footnote 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
(3) Amounts represent contractual minimum lease obligations on operating leases as of December 31, 2018.
For further information relating to these obligations, see Footnote 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
(4) Primarily consists of purchase commitments with suppliers entered into as of December 31, 2018, for the purchase of materials, packaging and other components and services.
These purchase commitment amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are legally enforceable and that specify all significant terms including minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases.
(5) Represents the future cash payments related to Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2018, for the one-time provisional transition tax on the Company’s previously untaxed foreign earnings.
See Footnote 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
(6) Total does not include contractual obligations reported on the December 31, 2018 balance sheet as current liabilities, except for current portion of long-term debt, short-term debt and accrued interest.
The Company also has liabilities for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company is under audit from time-to-time by the IRS and other taxing authorities, and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming year.
While it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will be settled over time; therefore, the $463 million in unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2018, is excluded from the preceding table.
See Footnote 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
31 Table of Contents Additionally, the Company has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement benefit plans, which are excluded from the preceding table.
The timing and amounts of the funding requirements are uncertain because they are dependent on interest rates and actual returns on plan assets, among other factors.
See Footnote 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $74.6 million in standby letters of credit primarily related to the Company’s self-insurance programs, including workers’ compensation, product liability and medical.
See Footnote 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Critical Accounting Estimates The Company’s accounting policies are more fully described in Footnote 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
As disclosed in that footnote, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes.
Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty.
Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment.
Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The following sections describe the Company’s critical accounting policies.
Sales Recognition, Customer Programs and Variable Consideration The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied and are recognized at a point in time, which generally occurs either on shipment or on delivery based on contractual terms, which is also when control is transferred.
The Company’s primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of its consumer and commercial products to its customers.
Prior to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“Topic 606”), the Company deferred recognition of revenue for limited FOB shipping point transactions where it had a practice of providing the buyer with replacement goods at no additional cost if there was loss or damage while the goods were in transit.
After the adoption of Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue at the time of shipment for these transactions.
The Company measures revenue as the amount of consideration for which it expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or providing services.
Certain customers may receive cash and/or non-cash incentives such as cash discounts, returns, credits or reimbursements related to defective products, customer discounts (such as volume or trade discounts), cooperative advertising and other customer-related programs, which are accounted for as variable consideration.
In some cases, the Company must apply judgment, including contractual rates and historical payment trends, when estimating variable consideration.
In addition, the Company participates in various programs and arrangements with customers designed to increase the sale of products by these customers.
Among the programs negotiated are arrangements under which allowances are earned by customers for attaining agreed-upon sales levels or for participating in specific marketing programs.
Coupon programs are also developed on a customer- and territory-specific basis with the intent of increasing sales by all customers.
Under customer programs and arrangements that require sales incentives to be paid in advance, the Company amortizes the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume.
When incentives are paid in arrears, the Company accrues the estimated amount to be paid based on the program’s contractual terms, expected customer performance and/or estimated sales volume.
These estimates are determined using historical customer experience and other factors, which sometimes require significant judgment.
Due to the length of time necessary to obtain relevant data from customers, among other factors, actual amounts paid can differ from these estimates.
As a result of the adoption of Topic 606, certain costs and cash payments made to customers previously recorded in costs of products sold and selling, general and administrative expenses have been reclassified against net sales as they do not meet the specific criteria to qualify as a distinct good or service under the new guidance, primarily related to payments to customers for defective products under warranty.
For further information regarding revenue recognition see Footnotes 1 and 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Inventory Reserves The Company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow-moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
32 Table of Contents Business Combinations The Company allocates purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values.
The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.
Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from customer relationships, trade names and trademarks and acquired patents and developed technology; the period of time the Company expects to use the acquired intangible asset; and discount rates.
In estimating the future cash flows, the Company considers demand, competition and other economic factors.
The Company’s estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates, which could result in impairment charges in the future.
Estimates associated with the accounting for business combinations may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which could result in adjustments to the values of tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired or could result in future income or expenses if such changes in estimates are identified beyond one year from the date of acquisition.
The Company considers various factors in determining whether an acquired trademark or trade name has an indefinite life.
In assessing whether an acquired trademark or trade name has an indefinite life, the Company considers legal and regulatory provisions that may limit the useful life, customer loyalty, brand strength and positioning, the effects of obsolescence and other economic factors, the Company’s plans for incorporating the trademark or trade name into its brand portfolio and the Company’s historical experience in using and renewing similar assets.
The Company considers all other acquired intangible assets definite-lived assets and generally amortizes the assets on a straight-line basis.
The Company determines the amortizable life of acquired definite-lived intangible assets based on the number of years over which a significant amount of the discounted cash flows contributes to the estimated fair value of the asset.
The Company accounts for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination.
A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred.
When estimating the costs of exiting facilities, estimates are made regarding future sublease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results.
As a result, the Company may be required to revise its estimates which may affect the Company’s results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles As a result of acquisitions in prior years, the Company has significant intangible assets on its balance sheet that include goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles (primarily, trademarks and tradenames).
The Company’s goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are tested and reviewed for impairment annually as of July 1, or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant.
The Company performs its annual impairment testing of goodwill at a reporting unit level, and all of the Company’s goodwill is assigned to the Company’s reporting units.
Reporting units are generally one level below the operating segment level.
As a result of the Company’s Accelerated Transformation Plan that resulted in a number of businesses designated as held for sale, the Company is now comprised of seven reporting units, within its three primary operating segments as part of its continuing operations.
The amount of goodwill attributable to continuing operations subject to its annual goodwill impairment testing as of July 1, 2018 was $6.8 billion.
Additionally, the carrying value of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets attributable to continuing operations was approximately $8.5 billion as of the July 1, 2018.
In addition to annual testing, the Company had triggering events as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2018 that resulted in impairment charges being recorded.
During the current year, the Company used a quantitative approach to test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles and bypassed the qualitative approach.
The quantitative approach in the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of each of the reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units.
If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss would be recognized (not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill).
Goodwill impairment testing requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, including the identification of reporting units; the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units; and the estimation of future cash flows, terminal values, discount rates and total enterprise value.
The Company primarily uses discounted cash flow valuation methods based on five-year cash flow projections.
The cash flows projected are analyzed on a “debt-free” basis (before cash payments to equity and interest bearing debt investors) in order to develop an enterprise value from operations for the reporting unit.
A provision is also made, based on these projections, for the value of the reporting unit at the end of the forecast period, or terminal value.
The present value of the finite-period cash flows and the terminal value are determined using a selected discount rate.
33 Table of Contents The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions (such as cash flow projections, terminal values and discount rates).
For impairment testing purposes, the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is determined using the same method which was used for determining the initial fair value upon acquisition.
The first method is the relief from royalty method, which estimates the value of a tradename by discounting the hypothetical avoided royalty payments to their present value over the economic life of the asset.
The second method is the excess earnings method, which estimates the value of the intangible asset by quantifying the residual (or excess) cash flows generated by the asset, and discounting those cash flows to the present.
The excess earnings methodology requires the application of contributory asset charges.
Contributory asset charges typically include assumed payments for the use of working capital, tangible assets and other intangible assets.
Changes in forecasted operations and other assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair values.
Changes in business conditions could potentially require adjustments to these asset valuations.
The Company’s testing date is July 1; however, the Company concluded that a triggering event had occurred as of September 30, 2018, as a result of (1) the decline in the Company’s stock price during the third quarter such that the Company’s market capitalization was well below book value (net shareholders’ equity) and (2) updated cash flow projections for its businesses.
As of September 30, 2018, the Company therefore applied higher risk adjusted discount rates to the projected cash flows of its reporting units which reduced the fair values of each of the Company’s reporting units, except the Writing division, below their carrying values.
During the third quarter of 2018, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $3.9 billion to reduce the carrying values of these reporting units to their fair values (see Footnote 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements).
In addition, as of December 31, 2018, the Company concluded that another triggering event had occurred for the Food, Appliances and Cookware, Connected Home and Security, Baby and Home Fragrance reporting units.
At December 31, 2018, the Company updated the fair values of its reporting units based on a discounted cash flow methodology reflecting the latest projections which included, among other things, the pricing impacts of the recently announced tariffs on Chinese imports, other inflation, as well as projected benefits from the Company’s cost savings programs.
Given the Company’s impairment charges in 2018, there is minimal difference between the estimated fair values and the carrying values of some of the Company’s reporting units increasing the likelihood of future impairment charges.
As of December 31, 2018, the implied fair value of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their respective carrying value by more than 10%, other than the Connected Home and Security and Home Fragrance reporting units.
The carrying values of these two reporting units comprise $0.2 billion of $3.0 billion of remaining goodwill, and approximate their fair values.
During the third quarter of 2018, the Company performed the quantitative impairment tests in its annual impairment testing for all its trade names using either the relief from royalty method or excess earnings method similar to their initial valuations.
The discounted cash flows used to estimate fair values of the trade names employed under either of these methods reflected the higher risk adjusted discount rates that affected the respective reporting units.
In addition, the Company updated its quantitative analysis as of December 31, 2018 as a result of the triggering event noted above.
During 2018, the Company recorded impairment charges of $4.4 billion, of which $0.2 billion was recorded during the fourth quarter 2018, related to various trade names within its reporting units as follows: Trade names within the Food and Appliances segment, primarily acquired in the Jarden acquisition, were impaired by $0.1 billion during the fourth quarter of 2018, and $1.7 billion during 2018, as their carrying values exceeded their fair values.
An increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate used in the discounted cash flows to estimate fair values of these tradenames would have resulted in an increase to the impairment charge of approximately $0.1 billion.
The remaining carrying value of trade names within this segment is approximately $1.6 billion, with $0.7 billion of those trade names with fair values in excess of 10% of the carrying values.
Trade names within the Home and Outdoor Living segment, all acquired in the Jarden acquisition, were impaired by $0.1 billion during the fourth quarter of 2018, and $2.4 billion during 2018, as their carrying values exceeded their fair values.
An increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate used in the discounted cash flows to estimate fair values of these tradenames would have resulted in an increase to the impairment charge of approximately $0.2 billion.
The remaining carrying value of trade names within this segment is approximately $1.9 billion, with $0.7 billion of those trade names with fair values in excess of 10% of the carrying values.
Trade names within the Learning and Development segment, primarily acquired in the Jarden acquisition, were impaired by $0.2 billion during 2018 as their carrying values exceeded their fair values.
An increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate used in the discounted cash flows to estimate fair values of these tradenames would not have resulted in an increase to the impairment charge.
The remaining carrying value of trade names within this segment is approximately $0.6 billion, all with fair values in excess of 10% of the carrying values.
Some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units are outside the control of management, including interest rates, cost of capital, tax rates, credit ratings, foreign exchange rates, labor inflation, and industry growth.
While the Company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair values of the reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, it is possible changes could occur.
Approximately $0.2 billion of goodwill and $2.1 billion 34 Table of Contents of indefinite-lived intangible assets are recorded at their approximate fair value, which exceed their carrying values by less than 10%, and are highly susceptible to changes in estimates and assumptions.
The Company will continue to monitor its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets for any triggering events or other signs of impairment.
The Company may be required to perform additional impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment, further sustained deterioration of the Company’s market capitalization, and other factors in the future.
Although management cannot predict when improvements in macroeconomic conditions will occur, if consumer confidence and consumer spending decline significantly in the future or if commercial and industrial economic activity or the market capitalization deteriorates significantly from current levels, it is reasonably likely the Company will be required to record impairment charges in the future.
Valuation of Assets held for Sale As of December 31, 2018, the Company had five disposal groups classified as held for sale.
Current assets held for sale, net of current liabilities held for sale were $2.9 billion at December 31, 2018.
Upon designation as held for sale, the Company’s disposal groups are assessed for impairment by comparing the fair value of the disposal groups to their carrying values.
The fair value of the disposal groups is estimated using a market multiple approach.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded impairment charges of $697 million related to the Process Solutions disposal group, $131 million related to its Rexair disposal group, and $80 million related to its U.S.
Playing Cards disposal group.
The Company uses various assumptions to estimate fair value under the market multiple approach, including estimating the market multiples expected from the eventual sale of the disposal groups based on information obtained as a result of its marketing process.
Capitalized Software Costs The Company capitalizes costs associated with internal-use software during the application development stage after both the preliminary project stage has been completed and the Company’s management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development.
Capitalized internal-use software costs include: (i) external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software; (ii) payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project; and (iii) interest costs incurred while developing the software.
Capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose.
The Company expenses as incurred research and development, general and administrative, and indirect costs associated with internal-use software.
In addition, the Company expenses as incurred training, maintenance and other internal-use software costs incurred during the post-implementation stage.
Costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of internal-use software are capitalized only if such modifications result in additional functionality of the software.
The Company amortizes internal-use software costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software.
Capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of impairment, including but not limited to a significant change in available technology or the manner in which the software is being used.
Impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values.
Other Long-Lived Assets The Company continuously evaluates whether impairment indicators related to its property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are present.
These impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition, or a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group.
If impairment indicators are present, the Company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets.
The sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount.
The cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future sales and expenses, working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the Company’s forecasts.
If the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, the Company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group.
Generally, the Company performs its testing of the asset group at the reporting unit level, as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available.
Product Liability Reserves The Company has a self-insurance program for product liability that includes reserves for self-retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance.
The Company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods, review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves.
The Company’s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the Company’s product liability reserve.
While the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims, the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the Company, and such additional losses may be material to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
35 Table of Contents Legal and Environmental Reserves The Company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, as well as contract and other disputes.
The Company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and estimates the probability and amount of loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows.
The estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated.
No insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the Company’s cost estimates or reserve, nor do the Company’s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes, except with respect to long-term operations and maintenance, Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and other matters which are estimated at present value.
Income Taxes In accordance with relevant authoritative guidance, the Company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach.
Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by current enacted tax rates.
Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.
The Company’s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the IRS and other tax authorities.
Although the Company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, it has established tax, interest and penalty reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken, which could result in additional liabilities for taxes, interest and penalties.
The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies.
For uncertain tax positions, the Company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance, which requires application of a “more likely than not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions.
The Company’s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the Company’s effective tax rate as well as impact operating results.
The Company’s provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be favorably or adversely affected by earnings being higher or lower in countries that have lower tax rates and higher or lower in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities; by expiration of or lapses in tax-related legislation; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by changes in accounting principles; by liquidity needs driving repatriations of non-U.S. cash to the U.S.; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, including possible U.S. changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules.
The Company’s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign tax rates, tax credits, the domestic manufacturing deduction, tax audit settlements and valuation allowance adjustments.
Significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions, determining valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets, and ultimately, the income tax provision.
It is difficult to predict when resolution of income tax matters will occur and when recognition of certain income tax assets and liabilities is appropriate, and the Company’s income tax expense in the future may continue to differ from the statutory rate because of the effects of similar items.
For example, if items are favorably resolved or management determines a deferred tax asset is realizable that was previously reserved, the Company will recognize period tax benefits.
Conversely, to the extent tax matters are unfavorably resolved or management determines a valuation allowance is necessary for a tax asset that was not previously reserved, the Company will recognize incremental period tax expense.
These matters are expected to contribute to the tax rate differing from the statutory rate and continued volatility in the Company’s effective tax rate.
See Footnote 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Pensions and Postretirement Benefits The Company records annual amounts relating to its pension and postretirement plans based on calculations, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates.
The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so.
The effect of modifications is generally deferred and amortized over future periods.
The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience, market conditions and the input from its actuaries and investment advisors.
The pension and postretirement obligations are measured as of December 31 for 2018 and 2017.
36 Table of Contents The Company employs a total return investment approach for its pension and postretirement benefit plans whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of pension plan assets.
The intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by outperforming plan liabilities over the long run.
Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition.
The investment portfolios contain a diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments.
Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across geography and market capitalization through investments in U.S. large-capitalization stocks, U.S. small-capitalization stocks and international securities.
Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.
The expected long-term rate of return for plan assets is based upon many factors including expected asset allocations, historical asset returns, current and expected future market conditions, risk and active management premiums.
The target asset allocations for the Company’s domestic pension plans may vary by plan, based in part due to plan demographics, funded status and liability duration.
In general, the Company’s target asset allocations are as follows: equities approximately 20% to 40%; fixed income approximately 40% to 60%; and cash, alternative investments and other, approximately 10% to 30% as of December 31, 2018.
Actual asset allocations may vary from the targeted allocations for various reasons, including market conditions and the timing of transactions.
The Company maintains numerous international defined benefit pension plans.
The asset allocations for the international investment may vary by plan and jurisdiction and are primarily based upon the plan structure and plan participant profile.
At December 31, 2018, the domestic plan assets were allocated as follows: Equities: approximately 16% and Other Investments (alternative investments, fixed-income securities, cash and other): approximately 84%.
Actual asset allocations may vary from the targeted allocations for various reasons, including market conditions and the timing of transactions.
For 2018, 2017 and 2016, the actual return (loss) on plan assets for the Company’s U.S. pension plan assets was approximately ($71) million, $172 million and $71 million, respectively, versus an expected return on plan assets of approximately $68 million, $73 million and $69 million, respectively.
The actual amount of future contributions will depend, in part, on long-term actual return on assets and future discount rates.
Pension contributions for all the Company’s pension plans for 2019 are estimated to be approximately $24 million, which is consistent with the 2018 contributions.
The weighted average expected return on plan assets assumption for 2018 was approximately 5.1% for the Company’s pension plans.
The weighted average discount rate at the 2018 measurement date used to measure the pension and postretirement benefit obligations was approximately 3.7% and 4.0%, respectively.
A 25 basis points decrease in the discount rate at the 2018 measurement date would increase the pension plans’ projected benefit obligation by approximately $53 million.
The healthcare cost trend rates used in valuing the Company’s postretirement benefit obligation are established based upon actual healthcare cost trends and consultation with actuaries and benefit providers.
At the 2018 measurement date, the current weighted average healthcare cost trend rate assumption was approximately 6.7%.
The current healthcare cost trend rate gradually decreases to an ultimate healthcare cost trend rate of 4.5%.
A one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would not have a material effect on the postretirement benefit obligation or the service and interest cost components of postretirement benefit costs.
See Footnote 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans.
Restructuring The Company has and expects to continue to engage in restructuring activities, which requires management to utilize significant estimates related to the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reductions and other separation programs, realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete, lease cancellation costs, sublease income and other exit costs, including environmental and legal contingencies associated with restructuring activities.
The Company accrues for severance and other employee separation costs under these activities when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable.
The rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans, historical experience and previously negotiated settlements.
The Company accrues for future lease costs, net of management’s estimate for future sublease income, when the leased property has been vacated and is no longer being used.
When estimating the costs of exiting facilities, estimates are made regarding future sublease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results and result in additional restructuring costs in future periods.
Environmental and legal contingencies associated with restructuring activities are accrued when the liability is probable of being incurred and is estimable.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Footnote 1 — Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies — Recent Accounting Pronouncements.” International Operations For 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company’s non-U.S. businesses accounted for approximately 33%, 29% and 28% of net sales, respectively (see Footnote 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk In general, business enterprises can be exposed to market risks including fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices, and that can affect the cost of operating, investing and financing under those conditions.
The Company believes it has moderate exposure to these risks.
The Company assesses market risk based on changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates and commodity prices utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential loss in earnings, fair values and cash flows based on hypothetical changes in rates and prices.
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its variable rate debt and price risk on its fixed rate debt.
As such, the Company monitors the interest rate environment and uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk and price risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable interest rates while attempting to minimize interest costs.
As of December 31, 2018, approximately $527 million of the Company’s debt carries a variable rate of interest either by nature or through the use of interest rate swaps.
The remainder of the debt (approximately $6.5 billion) carries a fixed rate of interest.
Based upon the Company’s debt structure at December 31, 2018, a hypothetical 1% increase in these interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately $5 million and decrease the fair values of debt by approximately $373 million.
While the Company transacts business predominantly in U.S. dollars and most of its revenues are collected in U.S. dollars, a substantial portion of the Company’s operating costs are denominated in other currencies, such as the Brazilian Real, British Pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese Renminbi, European Euro, Japanese Yen and Mexican Peso.
Changes in the relation of these and other currencies to the U.S. dollar will affect Company’s sales and profitability and could result in exchange losses.
For 2018, approximately 33% of the Company’s sales were denominated in foreign currencies, the most significant of which were: European Euro-approximately 8%; and Canadian dollar-approximately 5%.
The primary purpose of the Company’s foreign currency hedging activities is to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate exposure on the cash flows related to forecasted inventory purchases and sales.
A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on foreign currency gains and losses related to the foreign currency derivatives or the net fair value of the Company’s foreign currency derivatives.
The Company is exposed to the price risk that the rising cost of commodities has on certain of its raw materials.
As such, the Company monitors the commodities markets and from time to time the Company enters into commodity-based derivatives in order to mitigate the impact that the rising price of these commodities has on the cost of certain of the Company’s raw materials.
A hypothetical 10% change in the commodity prices underlying the derivatives would not have a material effect on the related gains and losses included in the Company’s results of operations.
The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to its derivative financial instruments, all of which are highly rated institutions; however, the Company does not anticipate non-performance by such counterparties.
The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
