ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
The discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.
Business Overview Newell Brands is a leading global consumer goods company with a strong portfolio of well-known brands, including Paper Mate®, Sharpie®, Dymo®, EXPO®, Parker®, Elmer’s®, Coleman®, Jostens®, Marmot®, Rawlings®, Oster®, Sunbeam®, FoodSaver®, Mr. Coffee®, Rubbermaid Commercial Products®, Graco®, Baby Jogger®, NUK®, Calphalon®, Rubbermaid®, Contigo®, First Alert®, Waddington and Yankee Candle®.
For hundreds of millions of consumers, Newell Brands makes life better every day, where they live, learn, work and play Business Strategy During 2017, the Company continued to execute the Growth Game Plan, the multi-year strategy that was updated in late 2016 for the new broader portfolio.
The Growth Game Plan enables the simplification of the organization and frees up resources to invest in growth initiatives and strengthened capabilities in support of the Company’s brands.
The changes being implemented in the execution of the Growth Game Plan are considered key enablers to building a more profitable and cash flow generative company, with global reach.
As part of the Growth Game Plan, the Company has transformed from a holding company to an operating company, consolidating its 32 business units into 16 global divisions while investing to extend its design, innovation, brand development and E-commerce capabilities across a broader set of categories.
The new global divisions are the key commercial nodes in the Company, including a Global E-commerce Division with responsibility for all E-commerce activity across the enterprise.
The divisions generally align to the four areas of strategic focus for the Company of Live, Learn, Work, and Play.
The new structure became effective January 1, 2017.
In 2017, the Company focused and strengthened its portfolio by completing seven divestitures and three bolt-on acquisitions in the Food Storage and Home Fragrance categories.
In the second half of 2017 and throughout 2018, the Company has focused and will focus on strengthening the organization, cash generation and delivering on the cost saving agenda.
In January 2018, Newell Brands announced that it will explore a series of strategic initiatives to accelerate its transformation plan, improve operational performance and enhance shareholder value.
The Company is exploring strategic options for industrial and commercial product assets, including Waddington, Process Solutions, Rubbermaid Commercial Products and Mapa, as well as the smaller consumer businesses, including Rawlings, Goody, Rubbermaid Outdoor, Closet, Refuse and Garage, and U.S.
Playing Cards.
Execution of these strategic options would significantly reduce operational complexity and focus the Company’s remaining portfolio on leading brands in global consumer-facing categories that can leverage Newell Brands’ advantaged capabilities in brands, innovation, design and E-commerce.
Organizational Structure Newell Brands makes life better for hundreds of millions of consumers every day, where they live, learn, work, and play.
The Company achieves this impact through its leading portfolio of brands, its commitment to further strengthen those brands, and by deploying these to new markets around the world.
In order to align reporting with the Company’s Growth Game Plan strategy and organization structure, effective January 1, 2017, Newell Brands is reporting its financial results in five segments as Live, Learn, Work, Play and Other.
All prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current reporting structure.

See Footnote 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
The transformative transaction created a global consumer goods company with a portfolio of leading brands in large, growing, unconsolidated, global markets.
The scaled enterprise is expected to accelerate profitable growth with leading brands in a global market that exceeds $100 billion, with business and capability development supported by the efficiencies of the combined company.
Management believes the scale of Newell Brands in key categories, channels and geographies creates a much broader opportunity to deploy the Company’s advantaged set of brand development and commercial capabilities for accelerated growth and margin expansion.
2015 Activity In October 2015, the Company acquired Elmer’s Products, Inc. (“Elmer’s”) for a purchase price of $571 million.

Elmer’s is included in the Learn segment from date of acquisition.
Divestitures On July 14, 2017, the Company sold its Winter Sports business for a selling price of approximately $240 million, subject to customary working capital adjustments.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $59.1 million related to the writedown of the carrying value of the net assets of the Winter Sports business based on the expected proceeds to be received.
The impairment charge is comprised of a $12.6 million charge related to the impairment of goodwill and a $46.5 million charge related to the impairment of other intangible assets.
The Company recorded a pre-tax loss on sale of $47.6 million driven by funding the business’ working capital needs and withholding taxes between June 30, 2017 and July 14, 2017, which is included in other expense (income), net in consolidated statement of operations for 2017.
During 2017, the Company sold its Rubbermaid® consumer storage totes business, its stroller business under the Teutonia® brand, its Lehigh business, its firebuilding business and its triathlon apparel business under the Zoot® and Squadra® brands.
The selling prices for these businesses were not material.
Based on the consideration received, the Company recorded impairment charges of $15.3 million related to the write down of the carrying value of the net assets of the firebuilding and Teutonia® stroller businesses to their estimated fair market value.
The Company sold the firebuilding business to Royal Oak Enterprises, LLC (“Royal Oak”).
Martin E. Franklin and Ian G.H.
Ashken are affiliates of Royal Oak and were Company directors during 2017.
In March 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Tools business, including the Irwin®, Lenox® and Hilmor® brands.
The selling price was $1.95 billion, subject to customary working capital adjustments.

27 Table of Contents In June 2016, the Company sold its Décor business, including Levolor® and Kirsch® window coverings and drapery hardware, for consideration, net of fees, of approximately $224 million, resulting in a pretax gain of $160 million, which is included in other (income) expense, net for 2016.
During 2015, the Company sold Endicia for net proceeds of $209 million resulting in a pretax gain of $154 million which is included in income from discontinued operations, net of tax for 2015.
During 2015, the Company ceased operations in its Culinary electrics and retail businesses.
Ongoing Restructuring Initiatives After the completion of the Jarden Acquisition, the Company initiated a comprehensive strategic assessment of the business and launched a new corporate strategy that focuses the portfolio, prioritizes investment in the categories with the greatest potential for growth, and extends the Company’s advantaged capabilities in insights, product design, innovation, and E-commerce to the broadened portfolio.
The investments in new capabilities are designed to unlock the growth potential of the portfolio and will be funded by a commitment to release cost savings from 2016 to 2021 of approximately $1.3 billion through the combination of the completion of Project Renewal (approximately $300 million) and delivery of cost synergies associated with the Jarden integration (approximately $1 billion).
This new corporate strategy is called the Growth Game Plan and builds on the successful track record of growth acceleration, margin development, and value creation associated with the transformation of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. from 2011 through 2016.
Project Renewal In April 2015, the Company committed to a further expansion of Project Renewal (the “April 2015 Expansion”).
Project Renewal was initially launched in October 2011 to reduce the complexity of the organization and increase investment in growth platforms within the business.
Under Project Renewal, the Company has simplified and aligned its businesses around two key activities — Brand & Category Development and Market Execution & Delivery.
Pursuant to an expansion of Project Renewal in October 2014, the Company has: (i) further streamlined its supply chain function, including reducing overhead and realigning the supply chain management structure; (ii) invested in value analysis and value engineering efforts to reduce product and packaging costs; (iii) reduced operational and manufacturing complexity in its Learn segment; and (iv) further streamlined its distribution and transportation functions.
Under the April 2015 Expansion, the Company has further implemented additional activities designed to further streamline business partnering functions (e.g., Finance/IT, Legal and Human Resources), optimize global selling and trade marketing functions and rationalize the Company’s real estate portfolio.
Project Renewal was completed by the end of 2017, and as a result, additional cash payments and savings will be realized thereafter.
See Footnote 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Jarden Integration The Company currently expects to incur up to $1.0 billion of restructuring and other costs through 2021 to integrate the legacy Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden businesses (the “Jarden Integration”).
Initially, integration projects will primarily be focused on driving cost synergies in procurement, overhead functions and organizational changes designed to redefine the operating model of the Company from a holding company to an operating company.
Restructuring costs associated with integration projects are expected to include employee-related cash costs, including severance, retirement and other termination benefits, and contract termination and other costs.
In addition, other costs associated with the Jarden Integration include advisory and personnel costs for managing and implementing integration projects.
Foreign Currency – Venezuela Until December 31, 2015, the Company accounted for its Venezuelan operations using highly inflationary accounting, and therefore, the Company remeasured assets, liabilities, sales and expenses denominated in Bolivar Fuertes (“Bolivars”) into U.S.
Dollars using the applicable exchange rate, and the resulting translation adjustments were included in earnings.
As of December 31, 2015, the Company determined it could no longer exercise control over its Venezuela operations because the availability of U.S.
Dollars had declined significantly over the past several years in each of Venezuela’s three exchange mechanisms.
As a result, the Company deconsolidated its Venezuelan operations.
Prior to the deconsolidation of the Venezuela operations on December 31, 2015, the results of the Company’s Venezuelan operations have been included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2015 and all prior periods.
As of December 31, 2015, the Company began accounting for its investment in its Venezuelan operations using the cost method of accounting, and the cost basis was adjusted to nil as of December 31, 2015.
During 2015 the Venezuelan operations generated 2.2% of consolidated net sales and $51.1 million of the Company’s reported annual operating income.
28 Table of Contents As a result of deconsolidating its Venezuelan operations, the Company recorded a charge of $173 million in 2015.
The charge consisted of the write-off of the Company’s Venezuelan operations’ net assets of $74.7 million, as well as $58.3 million of Venezuela receivable-related assets held by other subsidiaries, resulting in $133 million of total charges associated with the deconsolidation of Venezuela’s net assets.
In addition, in accordance with applicable accounting standards for foreign currency and the transition to the cost method for Venezuela’s operations, the Company was required to write-off the currency translation adjustment that arose prior to the application of hyperinflationary accounting in 2010 that was included in other comprehensive loss in equity.
The write-off of the currency translation adjustment resulted in a pre-tax charge of $39.7 million.
Impact of Hurricanes and Market Conditions During the third quarter, Hurricane Harvey significantly disrupted a large part of the U.S. resin manufacturing supply chain.
As a result of the disruption, the Company has experienced increased resin and transportation cost inflation.

Foreign currency impacts on a period-over-period basis were not material.
The change in cost of products sold for 2017 was primarily due to the Jarden Acquisition, as well as other acquisitions (approximately $1.8 billion), partially offset by inventory step-up charges primarily related to the Jarden Acquisition recorded in 2016 (approximately $480 million) and the impact of divestitures (approximately $650 million).
Gross margin was 34.5% versus 33.2% percent in 2016.
The change was primarily due to the impact of the inventory step-up charge recorded in 2016 and the benefits of synergies and productivity, partially offset by the negative mix effects partially related to the Jarden Acquisition.
The change in SG&A for 2017 was primarily due to the Jarden Acquisition, as well as other acquisitions (approximately $720 million) and increased investment related to brand development, E-commerce and insights, partially offset by the impact of divestitures (approximately $200 million) and benefits of synergies and productivity.
Additionally, the decrease in certain labor-related costs was mostly offset by an increase in integration costs.
The restructuring costs for 2017 were mostly comprised of costs related to the Jarden Integration and other restructuring activities, which primarily relate to the Jarden Acquisition.
The restructuring costs for 2016 related to the Jarden Integration and Project Renewal.
See Footnote 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
The impairment of goodwill, intangibles and other assets of $85 million consists primarily of the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets from the sale of the Winter Sports business ($59.1 million) and the writedown of carrying values of net assets from the sale of the firebuilding and Teutonia® stroller businesses ($15.3 million).
Consolidated operating income as a percentage of net sales for 2017 and 2016 was approximately 8.3%.
The decrease in aforementioned inventory step-up charge related to the Jarden Acquisition, the impact of increased net sales and the benefits of synergies and productivity, as well as a reduction in bonus expense, were mostly offset by the negative mix effects related to the Jarden Acquisition, increased investment related to the expansion of brand development, E-commerce and insights, as well as costs associated with the delivery of synergies, the increase in the impairment of goodwill, intangibles and other assets and the acquisition-related increase in amortization of intangibles.
29 Table of Contents The increase in interest expense for 2017 was primarily due to higher average debt levels versus the same prior year period.
The weighted average interest rate for 2017 and 2016 was approximately 4.0% and 3.7%, respectively.
As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the United States, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $1.5 billion due to statutory tax rate changes in the United States and an $87.2 million tax benefit to reverse the Company’s deferred tax liability on historical Jarden earnings, partially offset by a $195 million tax expense relating to a mandatory repatriation tax.
See Footnote 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding income taxes.

Operating income as a percentage of net sales for 2017 and 2016 was approximately 10.3% and 10.4%, respectively.
The impact of the 2016 inventory step-up charge related to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately $166 million) and a reduction in bonus expense, was more than offset by the negative mix impact of the Jarden Acquisition, and the acquisition-related increase in amortization of intangibles, as well as the impact of incremental promotional activity.
Learn The increase in net sales for 2017 was primarily due to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately 9%) and an increase in sales in the Writing business, in part due to increases in Elmer’s glue sales, partially offset by decreases in other Writing categories due to inventory reductions at certain mass market retailers and a decline in the Fine Art category.
Operating income as a percentage of net sales for 2017 and 2016 was approximately 18.4% and 21.3%, respectively.
The decrease was primarily driven by the mix impact of the Jarden Acquisition, as well as the unfavorable impact of product mix due to the growth of Elmer’s glue sales within the Writing business, increased advertising and promotion costs, and fire-related losses at a Writing warehouse in Mexico, partially offset by the impact of the 2016 inventory step-up charge related to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately $53 million) and a reduction in bonus expense.
Work The increase in net sales for 2017 was primarily due to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately 18%), and growth in the Safety and Security and Waddington categories.
Operating income as a percentage of net sales for 2017 and 2016 was approximately 14.8% and 12.6%, respectively.
The increase was primarily driven by the impact of the 2016 inventory step-up charge related to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately $65 million), benefits of cost synergies and a reduction in bonus expense.
Play The increase in net sales for 2017 was primarily due to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately 35%) with the balance of growth generated primarily by the Beverage, Coleman, Team Sports and Technical Apparel categories, primarily due to increased demand.
30 Table of Contents Operating income as a percentage of net sales for 2017 and 2016 was approximately 10.3% and 2.2%, respectively.
The increase was primarily driven by the impact of the 2016 inventory step-up charge related to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately $148 million), cost synergies, and a reduction in bonus expense.
Other The decrease in net sales for 2017 was primarily due to impact of divestitures (approximately 55%), partially offset by the Jarden Acquisition (approximately 15%).
Operating income as a percentage of net sales for 2017 and 2016 was approximately 1.1% and 9.5%, respectively.
The change was affected by an increase in the impairment of goodwill, intangibles and other assets (approximately $70 million), the impact of divestitures, and other costs that are primarily related to assets held for sale, partially offset by the impact of the 2016 inventory step-up charge related to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately $48 million).

Net sales were also favorably impacted by volume growth, pricing and the acquisition of Elmer’s.
Net sales were adversely affected by foreign currency, divestitures and the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations on December 31, 2015.
Gross margin as a percentage of net sales for 2016 and 2015 was 33.2% and 39.0% respectively.
The decrease was driven primarily by the negative impact of the charge for the inventory step-up related to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately $480 million), foreign currency, the mix effect of the Jarden Acquisition and deconsolidation of Venezuelan operations, partially offset by the benefits of productivity, input cost deflation and pricing.
The increase in SG&A for the for 2016 was primarily due to the Jarden Acquisition.
The increase was also driven by $261 million of costs during 2016 associated with the acquisition and integration of Jarden and an increase in incentive-related and other compensation costs.
These increases were partially offset by overhead cost savings from Project Renewal, $10.0 million of SG&A costs associated with the Graco product recall during 2015, a $41.5 million decrease in Project Renewal-related SG&A costs, which decreased from $78.0 million for 2015 to $36.5 million for 2016, and the impacts of foreign currency.
Restructuring costs for 2016 primarily related to the integration of Jarden and Project Renewal and consisted mostly of employee severance, termination benefits and employee relocation costs.
Restructuring costs for 2015 primarily related to Project Renewal and consisted of $6.7 million of facility and other exit costs, including impairments, $54.9 million of employee severance, termination benefits and employee relocation costs and $15.6 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs.
See Footnote 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Operating income as a percentage of net sales for 2016 and 2015 was 8.3% and 10.2%, respectively.
The decrease was primarily attributable to the charge for the inventory step-up related to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately $480 million) and the SG&A costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Jarden (approximately $261 million).
The increase in interest expense, net, for 2016 was primarily due to increased debt levels versus the prior year attributable to the Jarden Acquisition.

Operating income as a percentage of net sales for 2016 and 2015 was approximately 10.4% and 12.9%, respectively.
The decrease is primarily driven by the impact of the 2016 inventory step-up charge related to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately $166 million) and the negative mix impact of the Jarden Acquisition, partially offset by productivity, product mix, the Graco product recall in 2015 and acquisition costs incurred in the prior year period.
Learn The increase in net sales for 2016 was primarily due to the Jarden and Elmer’s acquisitions, increased advertising and promotion, robust merchandising efforts, overall innovation-led growth, and volume and distribution gains.
Net sales were negatively affected by the deconsolidation of the Venezuelan operations and unfavorable foreign currency translation.
Operating income as a percentage of net sales for 2016 and 2015 was approximately 21.3% and 24.3%, respectively.
The decrease is primarily driven by the impact of the 2016 inventory step-up charge related to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately $53 million), the mix impact of the Jarden Acquisition and the unfavorable impact of product mix due to the growth within Elmer’s.
Work The increase in net sales for 2016 was primarily due to the Jarden Acquisition.
Operating income as a percentage of net sales for 2016 and 2015 was approximately 12.6% and 10.6%, respectively.
The increase is primarily driven by the impact of the 2016 inventory step-up charge related to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately $65 million), partially offset by a slight decrease in gross margins primarily due to the mix impact of the Jarden Acquisition.
Play The increase in net sales for 2016 was primarily due to the Jarden Acquisition.
Operating income as a percentage of net sales for 2016 and 2015 was approximately 2.2% and 10.5%, respectively.
The decrease is primarily driven by the impact of the 2016 inventory step-up charge related to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately $148 million).
Other The increase in net sales for 2016 was primarily due to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately 120%), partially offset by the divestiture of the Décor business (approximately 13%) and sales decline in Latin America in the Tools business due to continuing macroeconomic challenges in Brazil.
Operating income as a percentage of net sales for 2016 and 2015 was approximately 9.5% and 11.1%, respectively.
The decrease is primarily driven by the impact of the 2016 inventory step-up charge related to the Jarden Acquisition (approximately $48 million), the impact of divestitures, and other costs that are primarily related to assets held for sale.
32 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $486 million, of which approximately $401 million was held by the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries.
Overall, the Company believes that available cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated from future operations, access to capital markets, and availability under its revolving credit facility and receivables purchase agreement will be adequate to support the cash needs of the Company.
The Company intends to use available cash, borrowing capacity, cash flows from future operations and alternative financing arrangements to invest in capital expenditures in support of the Company’s growth platforms, to maintain its dividend per share and to repay debt maturities as they come due and to complete its ongoing restructuring initiatives.
Cash and cash equivalents increased as follows for 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in millions): Increase (Decrease) 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 Cash provided by operating activities $ 932.0 $ 1,840.4 $ 592.9 $ (908.4 ) $ 1,247.5 Cash provided by (used in) investing activities 1,078.5 (8,824.8 ) (649.9 ) 9,903.3 (8,174.9 ) Cash provided by (used in) financing activities (2,161.6 ) 7,328.5 145.2 (9,490.1 ) 7,183.3 Currency effect on cash and cash equivalents 49.3 (31.4 ) (12.8 ) 80.7 (18.6 ) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (101.8 ) $ 312.7 $ 75.4 $ (414.5 ) $ 237.3 The Company tends to generate the majority of its operating cash flow in third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal variations in operating results, the timing of annual performance-based compensation payments, working capital requirements and credit terms provided to customers.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities The change in net cash provided by operations for 2017 is in part due to operating cash flows that were unusually high in 2016 driven by substantial benefits that do not repeat in the current year related to the Jarden Acquisition, including the absence of seasonal cash outflows for the legacy Jarden businesses, prior to the transaction; an increase in cash interest paid (approximately $143 million); an increase in make-whole interest and fees related to the extinguishment of debt (approximately $34 million); an increase in integration-related costs (approximately $137 million), an increase in cash taxes paid (approximately $73 million) and unfavorable working capital movements primarily related to the timing of inventory purchases.
The change in net cash provided by operations for 2016 was primarily due to the impact of the operating cash flow attributable to the Jarden Acquisition based on favorable timing of the acquisition during the second quarter, partially offset by higher interest payments associated with higher debt levels resulting from financing the Jarden Acquisition, transaction costs associated with the Jarden Acquisition (approximately $52 million) and higher annual incentive compensation (approximately $32 million) paid in March 2016 relating to the Company’s 2015 performance.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities The change in cash provided by (used in) investing activities for 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in cash used for the acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired (approximately $8 billion), primarily due to the Jarden Acquisition and a $1.9 billion increase in the proceeds from the sale of businesses.
For 2017, capital expenditures were $406 million versus $441 million for 2016.
The change in cash provided by (used in) investing activities for 2016 was primarily due to an increase in cash used for the acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired (approximately $8.1 billion), primarily due to the Jarden Acquisition, partially offset by the cash impact of the 2015 deconsolidation of the Venezuelan operations (approximately $98 million).
For 2016, capital expenditures were $441 million versus $211 million for 2015.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities The change in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities for 2017 was primarily due to the decrease in the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, primarily used to fund the Jarden Acquisition, in excess of payments on long-term debt (approximately $9.8 billion) an increase in cash dividends paid (approximately $100 million), an increase in the repurchase of shares of the Company (approximately $152 million) and cash paid to dissenting former Jarden shareholders (approximately $162 million), partially offset by the period-over-period increase in the net change in short-term debt (approximately $753 million).
The change in net cash provided by (used in) financing activities for 2016 was primarily due to the increase in the proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, primarily used to fund the Jarden Acquisition, in excess of payments on long-term debt (approximately $7.7 billion) and a decrease in the repurchase of common stock (approximately $180 million), partially offset by the period-over-period decrease in the net change in short-term debt (approximately $584 million) and an increase in dividends paid (approximately $122 million).
33 Table of Contents Capital Resources In March 2017, the Company commenced the Tender Offers totaling approximately $1.06 billion for any and all of its 6.25% senior notes due 2018 and up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of certain of its other senior notes.
In March 2017, pursuant to the Tender Offers, the Company repurchased approximately $63 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% senior notes due 2018, approximately $733 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.6% senior notes due 2019 and approximately $76 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.70% senior notes due 2020 for total consideration, excluding accrued interest, of approximately $897 million.
As a result of these debt extinguishments, the Company recorded a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $27.8 million during the first quarter of 2017, primarily comprised of prepayment premiums and a non-cash charge due to the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs.
In April 2017, the Company redeemed the remaining approximately $187 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% senior notes due 2018 for total consideration, excluding accrued interest of approximately $195 million.
As a result of this debt extinguishment, the Company recorded a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $4.5 million during the second quarter of 2017, primarily comprised of prepayment premiums, partially offset by the write-off of a deferred gain on previously terminated interest rate swaps.
The Company maintains a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility that matures in January 2022 (the “Facility”).
Under the Facility, the Company may borrow funds on a variety of interest rate terms.
The Facility also provides for the issuance of up to $100 million of letters of credit, so long as there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the Facility.
At December 31, 2017, there were no amounts outstanding under the Facility and net availability was approximately $1.2 billion.
The Company maintains a $950 million receivables purchase agreement that matures in October 2019 (the “Securitization Facility”) and bears interest at a margin over a variable interest rate.
At December 31, 2017, the borrowing rate margin and the unused line fee on the Securitization Facility were 0.80% and 0.40% per annum, respectively.
At December 31, 2017, net availability under the Facility was approximately $623 million.
The Company was not in default of any of its debt covenants at December 31, 2017.
In September 2017, the Company announced that it is reinstating its SRP that the Company voluntarily suspended in the fourth quarter of 2015 in association with the Jarden Acquisition.
On November 2, 2017, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved an extension and expansion to the Company’s existing SRP.
Under the updated SRP, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to approximately $1.26 billion of its outstanding shares through the end of 2020.
The repurchase of additional shares in the future will depend upon many factors, including the Company’s financial condition, liquidity and legal requirements.
During 2017, the Company repurchased approximately 5 million shares of its common stock under the SRP valued at approximately $152 million.
At December 31, 2017, approximately $1.1 billion remains available under the SRP.
At December 31, 2017, there were approximately 2.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock that had not been issued and $61 million in cash that had not been paid to the former holders of Jarden shares who are exercising their right to judicial appraisal under Delaware law.
Absent consent by the Company, these dissenting shareholders are no longer entitled to the merger consideration, but are instead entitled only to the judicially determined fair value of their shares, plus interest accruing from the date of the Jarden Acquisition, payable in cash.
However, it is possible that the Company could issue a consent to or reach agreement with one or more of these shareholders resulting in the issuance of Company shares (in lieu of or along with the payment of cash) in settlement of the dissenters’ claims.
In July 2017, approximately 6.6 million shares of the Company’s common stock (representing the stock component of the merger consideration) were issued and approximately $162 million (representing the cash component of the merger consideration) was paid to certain former dissenting shareholders in full settlement of their claims.
At December 31, 2017, the Company has accrued approximately $171 million of unpaid consideration related to these former shares of Jarden common stock.
Risk Management From time to time, the Company enters into derivative transactions to hedge its exposures to interest rate, foreign currency rate and commodity price fluctuations.
The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes.
Interest Rate Contracts The Company manages its fixed and floating rate debt mix using interest rate swaps.
The Company may use fixed and floating rate swaps to alter its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on its consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest.
Floating rate swaps would be used, depending on market conditions, to convert the fixed rates of long-term debt into short-term variable rates.
Fixed rate swaps would be used to reduce the Company’s risk of the possibility of increased interest costs.
Interest rate swap contracts are therefore used by the Company to separate interest rate risk management from the debt funding decision.
The cash paid and received from the settlement of interest rate swaps is included in interest expense.
34 Table of Contents Fair Value Hedges At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $527 million notional amount of interest rate swaps that exchange a fixed rate of interest for variable rate (LIBOR) of interest plus a weighted average spread.
These floating rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges against $277 million of principal on the 4.70% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2020 and $250 million of principal on the 4.00% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024 for the remaining life of these notes.
The effective portion of the fair value gains or losses on these swaps is offset by fair value adjustments in the underlying debt.
Cross-Currency Contracts The Company uses cross-currency swaps to hedge foreign currency risk on certain intercompany financing arrangements with foreign subsidiaries.
As of December 31, 2017, the notional value of outstanding cross-currency interest rate swaps was approximately $160 million.
The cross-currency interest rate swaps are intended to eliminate uncertainty in cash flows in U.S.
Dollars and British Pounds in connection with the intercompany financing arrangements.
The effective portions of the changes in fair values of these cross-currency interest rate swap agreements are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI’) and an amount is reclassified out of AOCI into other (income) expense, net, in the consolidated statement of operations in the same period that the carrying value of the underlying foreign currency intercompany financing arrangements are remeasured.
Foreign Currency Contracts The Company uses forward foreign currency contracts to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate exposure on the cash flows related to forecasted inventory purchases and sales and have maturity dates through September 2018.
The derivatives used to hedge these forecasted transactions that meet the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The effective portion of the gains or losses on these derivatives is deferred as a component of AOCI and is recognized in earnings at the same time that the hedged item affects earnings and is included in the same caption in the statements of operations as the underlying hedged item.
At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $260 million notional amount outstanding of forward foreign currency contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted inventory purchases and sales.
The Company also uses foreign currency contracts, primarily forward foreign currency contracts, to mitigate the foreign currency exposure of certain other foreign currency transactions.
At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $1.5 billion notional amount outstanding of these foreign currency contracts that are not designated as effective hedges for accounting purposes and have maturity dates through November 2018.
Fair market value gains or losses are included in the statements of operations and are classified in other (income) expense, net.
The following table presents the fair value of derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2017 (in millions): December 31,2017 Asset(Liability) Derivatives designated as effective hedges: Cash flow hedges: Cross-currency swaps $ (21.5 ) Foreign currency contracts (4.6 ) Fair value hedges: Interest rate swaps (7.8 ) Derivatives not designated as effective hedges: Foreign currency contracts (8.1 ) Commodity contracts 0.2 Total $ (41.8 ) Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has outstanding debt obligations maturing at various dates through 2046.
Certain other items, such as purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized as liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed.
Examples of items not recognized as liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of December 31, 2017, and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements.
The increase in interest expense, net, for 2016 was primarily due to increased debt levels versus the prior year attributable to the Jarden Acquisition.
35 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the effect that lease and other material contractual obligations is expected to have on the Company’s cash flow in the indicated period.
In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2017.
Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements: Year(s) (in millions) Total 1 2-3 4-5 After 5 Debt (1) $ 10,614.8 $ 671.9 $ 1,226.0 $ 1,613.2 $ 7,103.7 Interest on debt (2) 4,923.3 451.5 790.5 685.5 2,995.8 Operating lease obligations (3) 1,068.3 215.4 318.9 209.3 324.7 Purchase obligations (4) 346.3 245.2 83.8 17.0 0.3 Tax obligations (5) 134.1 8.1 21.4 21.4 83.2 Total (6) $ 17,086.8 $ 1,592.1 $ 2,440.6 $ 2,546.4 $ 10,507.7 (1) Amounts represent contractual obligations based on the earliest date that the obligation may become due, excluding interest, based on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2017.
For further information relating to these obligations, see Footnote 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
(2) Amounts represent estimated interest payable on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2017, excluding the impact of fixed to floating rate interest rate swaps.
Interest on floating-rate debt was estimated using the rate in effect as of December 31, 2017.
For further information, see Footnote 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
(3) Amounts represent contractual minimum lease obligations on operating leases as of December 31, 2017.
For further information relating to these obligations, see Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
(4) Primarily consists of purchase commitments with suppliers entered into as of December 31, 2017, for the purchase of materials, packaging and other components and services.
These purchase commitment amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are legally enforceable and that specify all significant terms including minimum quantity, price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchases.
(5) Represents the future cash payments related to Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017, for the one-time provisional transition tax on the Company’s previously untaxed foreign earnings.
See Footnote 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
(6) Total does not include contractual obligations reported on the December 31, 2017 balance sheet as current liabilities, except for current portion of long-term debt, short-term debt and accrued interest.
The Company also has liabilities for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company is under audit from time-to-time by the IRS and other taxing authorities, and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming year.
While it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will be settled over time; therefore, the $368 million in unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2017 is excluded from the preceding table.
See Footnote 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Additionally, the Company has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement benefit plans, which are excluded from the preceding table.
The timing and amounts of the funding requirements are uncertain because they are dependent on interest rates and actual returns on plan assets, among other factors.
See Footnote 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $72.2 million in standby letters of credit primarily related to the Company’s self-insurance programs, including workers’ compensation, product liability and medical.
See Footnote 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
As of December 31, 2017, the Company did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Critical Accounting Estimates The Company’s accounting policies are more fully described in Footnote 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
As disclosed in that footnote, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes.
Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty.
Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment.
Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The following sections describe the Company’s critical accounting policies.
36 Table of Contents Sales Recognition Sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership transfer, which generally occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms.
Sales are net of provisions for cash discounts, returns, customer discounts (such as volume or trade discounts), cooperative advertising and other sales-related discounts.
Customer Programs The Company participates in various programs and arrangements with customers designed to increase the sale of products by these customers.
Among the programs negotiated are arrangements under which allowances are earned by customers for attaining agreed-upon sales levels or for participating in specific marketing programs.
Coupon programs are also developed on a customer- and territory-specific basis with the intent of increasing sales by all customers.
Under customer programs and arrangements that require sales incentives to be paid in advance, the Company amortizes the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume.
When incentives are paid in arrears, the Company accrues the estimated amount to be paid based on the program’s contractual terms, expected customer performance and/or estimated sales volume.
These estimates are determined using historical customer experience and other factors, which sometimes require significant judgment.
Due to the length of time necessary to obtain relevant data from customers, among other factors, actual amounts paid can differ from these estimates.
Recovery of Accounts Receivable The Company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.
When aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position, the Company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes is collectible.
The Company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience.
Accounts are reviewed for potential write-off on a case-by-case basis.
Accounts deemed uncollectible are written off, net of expected recoveries.
If circumstances related to specific customers change, the Company’s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.
Inventory Reserves The Company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow-moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
Business Combinations The Company allocates purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values.
The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.
Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from customer relationships, trade names and trademarks and acquired patents and developed technology; the period of time the Company expects to use the acquired intangible asset; and discount rates.
In estimating the future cash flows, the Company considers demand, competition and other economic factors.
The Company’s estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates, which could result in impairment charges in the future.
Estimates associated with the accounting for business combinations may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which could result in adjustments to the values of tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired or could result in future income or expenses if such changes in estimates are identified beyond one year from the date of acquisition.
The Company considers various factors in determining whether an acquired trademark or trade name has an indefinite life.
In assessing whether an acquired trademark or trade name has an indefinite life, the Company considers legal and regulatory provisions that may limit the useful life, customer loyalty, brand strength and positioning, the effects of obsolescence and other economic factors, the Company’s plans for incorporating the trademark or trade name into its brand portfolio and the Company’s historical experience in using and renewing similar assets.
The Company considers all other acquired intangible assets definite-lived assets and generally amortizes the assets on a straight-line basis.
The Company determines the amortizable life of acquired definite-lived intangible assets based on the number of years over which a significant amount of the discounted cash flows contributes to the estimated fair value of the asset.
37 Table of Contents The Company accounts for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination.
A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred.
When estimating the costs of exiting facilities, estimates are made regarding future sublease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results.
As a result, the Company may be required to revise its estimates which may affect the Company’s results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made.
Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets As a result of acquisitions in prior years, the Company has significant intangible assets on its balance sheet that include goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles (primarily, trademarks and tradenames).
The Company’s goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are tested and reviewed for impairment annually (during the third quarter, which coincides with the Company’s annual planning process), or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant.
In 2017, the Company adopted authoritative accounting guidance that requires that goodwill impairment will now be determined by the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value (not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill), which removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test that required a hypothetical purchase price allocation to calculate an impairment.
The Company performs its annual impairment testing of goodwill at a reporting unit level, and all of the Company’s goodwill is assigned to the Company’s reporting units.
Reporting units are generally one level below the operating segment level.
As a result of the integration of businesses from the Jarden Acquisition and related changes to management, the Company identified 18 reporting units, comprising the Company’s five operating segments.
The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing as of July 1, 2017, at which date the Company’s total goodwill was $10.5 billion.
Additionally, the carrying value of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets was approximately $10.2 billion as of the July 1, 2017.
The Company uses a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test.
The qualitative approach, which was only applied to a portion of the Company’s reporting units, assesses various factors including, in part, the macroeconomic environment, industry and market specific conditions, financial performance, operating costs and cost impacts, as well as issues or events specific to the reporting unit.
If necessary, the next step in the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of each of the reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units.
If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss would be recognized (not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill).
Due to changes in the Company’s reportable segments resulting from the integration of businesses from the Jarden acquisition and significant future projected synergies, the Company proceeded directly to quantitative impairment testing for nearly all its reporting units.
Both qualitative and quantitative goodwill impairment testing requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, including the identification of reporting units; the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units; and the estimation of future cash flows, business growth rates, terminal values and discount rates.
The Company uses various valuation methods, such as the discounted cash flow and market multiple methods.
The income approach used is the discounted cash flow methodology and is based on five-year cash flow projections.
The cash flows projected are analyzed on a “debt-free” basis (before cash payments to equity and interest bearing debt investors) in order to develop an enterprise value from operations for the reporting unit.
A provision is also made, based on these projections, for the value of the reporting unit at the end of the forecast period, or terminal value.
The present value of the finite-period cash flows and the terminal value are determined using a selected discount rate.
The market multiple methodology involves estimating value based on the trading multiples for comparable public companies.
Multiples are determined through an analysis of certain publicly traded companies that are selected on the basis of operational and economic similarity with the business operations.
Valuation multiples are calculated for the comparable companies based on daily trading prices.
A comparative analysis between the reporting unit and the public companies forms the basis for the selection of appropriate risk-adjusted multiples.
The comparative analysis incorporates both quantitative and qualitative risk factors which relate to, among other things, the nature of the industry in which the reporting unit and other comparable companies are engaged.
The Company uses a qualitative approach to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing.
The Company applied this qualitative approach to select indefinite-lived intangible assets.
For the majority of the other indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company proceeded directly to quantitative impairment testing.
The testing of indefinite-lived intangibles under established guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions (such as cash flow projections, terminal values and discount rates).
For impairment testing purposes, the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is determined using the same method which was used for determining the initial value.
The first method is the relief from royalty method, which estimates the value of a tradename by discounting the hypothetical avoided royalty payments to their present value over the economic life of the asset.
The second method is the excess earnings method, which estimates the value of 38 Table of Contents the intangible asset by quantifying the residual (or excess) cash flows generated by the asset, and discounting those cash flows to the present.
The excess earnings methodology requires the application of contributory asset charges.
Contributory asset charges typically include assumed payments for the use of working capital, tangible assets and other intangible assets.
Changes in forecasted operations and other assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair values.
Changes in business conditions could potentially require adjustments to these asset valuations.
As a result of the 2017 annual impairment testing, the enterprise value of all of the Company’s reporting units except the Winter Sports reporting unit exceeded their carrying values by more than approximately 10%; however, changes in business conditions and assumptions could potentially require future adjustments to these asset valuations.
The Company’s Winter Sports reporting unit was a business held for sale as of the impairment testing date.
During the second quarter of 2017, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the business and used the estimated purchase price (approximately $200 million, net of working capital adjustments) to approximate the enterprise value of the Winter Sports reporting unit.
Since the carrying value exceeded the estimated enterprise value of the Winter Sports reporting unit, the Company recorded an impairment charge for goodwill and other intangible assets during second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangibles assets as of July 1, 2017, the Company determined that none of the indefinite-lived intangible assets were impaired.
Should projected revenues and cash flows not be achieved, estimated fair values could be reduced to below carrying values resulting in potential future material non-cash impairment charges.
The estimated fair values for certain trade names within the Live and Other segments exceeded their carrying values by less than a 10% threshold.
This primarily relates to trade names from the recent Jarden acquisition that were valued using the relief from royalty method and those tradenames with projected cashflows that are similar to the initial projection amounts used within the initial valuation.
The Company performed the quantitative impairment test for a trade name with a carrying value of $2.0 billion within the Appliances & Cookware reporting unit, noting the fair value exceeded the carrying value by $175 million, or approximately 9%.
The Company concluded that this trade name is not impaired.
However, a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used would have resulted in an impairment of approximately $165 million, or approximately 8%.
In addition, the Company performed the quantitative impairment test for a trade name with a carrying value of $208 million within the Food reporting unit, noting the fair value exceeded the carrying value by $4.7 million, or approximately 2%.
The Company concluded that this trade name is not impaired.
However, a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used would have resulted in an impairment of approximately $32 million, or approximately 15%, and a 100 basis point decrease in the royalty rate used would have resulted in an impairment of approximately $38 million, or approximately 18%.
The Company also performed the quantitative impairment test for a trade name with a carrying value of $81.0 million within the Gaming reporting unit, noting the fair value exceeded the carrying value by $6.2 million, or approximately 8%.
The Company concluded that this trade name is not impaired.
However, a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used would have resulted in an impairment of approximately $10 million, or approximately 12%, and a 100 basis point decrease in the royalty rate used would have resulted in an impairment of approximately $11 million, or approximately 14%.
While some of the Company’s businesses experienced a revenue decline and decreased profitability in 2017, the Company believes that its long-term growth strategy coupled with projected synergies and cost savings resulting from the Jarden Acquisition supports its fair value conclusions.
For both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the recoverability of these amounts is dependent upon achievement of the Company’s projections and the execution of key initiatives related to revenue growth and improved profitability.
Some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units are outside the control of management, including interest rates, cost of capital, tax rates, credit ratings, foreign exchange rates, labor inflation, and industry growth.
While the Company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair values of the reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, it is possible changes could occur.
As for all of the Company’s reporting units, if in future years, the reporting unit’s actual results are not consistent with the Company’s estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, the Company may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill.
The Company will continue to monitor its reporting units for any triggering events or other signs of impairment.
The Company may be required to perform additional impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors, which could result in impairment charges in the future.
Although management cannot predict when improvements in macroeconomic conditions will occur, if consumer confidence and consumer spending decline significantly in the future or if commercial and industrial economic activity deteriorates significantly from current levels, it is reasonably likely the Company will be required to record impairment charges in the future.
Additionally, there are significant synergy savings projected for the Company as a result of the Jarden Acquisition.
39 Table of Contents Subsequent Events In January 2018, the Company announced it is exploring strategic options for its industrial and commercial product assets, including Waddington, Process Solutions, Rubbermaid Commercial Products and Mapa, as well as the smaller consumer businesses, including Rawlings, Goody, Rubbermaid Outdoor, Closet, Refuse and Garage, and U.S.
Playing Cards.
The estimated selling price for each of these businesses is subject to many factors, including but not limited to, the number of potential buyers, buyer’s strategic fit and synergies and nature of the sales transaction.
The Company may incur future impairment charges if the carrying value of the business exceeds its estimated sales price.
Capitalized Software Costs The Company capitalizes costs associated with internal-use software during the application development stage after both the preliminary project stage has been completed and the Company’s management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development.
Capitalized internal-use software costs include: (i) external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software; (ii) payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project; and (iii) interest costs incurred while developing the software.
Capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose.
The Company expenses as incurred research and development, general and administrative, and indirect costs associated with internal-use software.
In addition, the Company expenses as incurred training, maintenance and other internal-use software costs incurred during the post-implementation stage.
Costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of internal-use software are capitalized only if such modifications result in additional functionality of the software.
The Company amortizes internal-use software costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software.
Capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of impairment, including but not limited to a significant change in available technology or the manner in which the software is being used.
Impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values.
Other Long-Lived Assets The Company continuously evaluates whether impairment indicators related to its property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are present.
These impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition, or a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group.
If impairment indicators are present, the Company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets.
The sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount.
The cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future sales and expenses, working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the Company’s forecasts.
If the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, the Company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group.
Generally, the Company performs its testing of the asset group at the product-line level, as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available.
Product Liability Reserves The Company has a self-insurance program for product liability that includes reserves for self-retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance.
The Company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods, review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves.
The Company’s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the Company’s product liability reserve.
While the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims, the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the Company, and such additional losses may be material to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
Legal and Environmental Reserves The Company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, as well as contract and other disputes.
The Company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and estimates the probability and amount of loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows.
The estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated.
No insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the Company’s cost estimates or reserve, nor do the Company’s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes, except with respect to long-term operations and maintenance, Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and other matters which are estimated at present value.
40 Table of Contents Income Taxes In accordance with relevant authoritative guidance, the Company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach.
Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by current enacted tax rates.
Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.
The Company’s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the IRS and other tax authorities.
Although the Company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, it has established tax, interest and penalty reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken, which could result in additional liabilities for taxes, interest and penalties.
The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies.
For uncertain tax positions, the Company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance, which requires application of a “more likely than not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions.
The Company’s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the Company’s effective tax rate as well as impact operating results.
The Company’s provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be favorably or adversely affected by earnings being higher or lower in countries that have lower tax rates and higher or lower in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities; by expiration of or lapses in tax-related legislation; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by changes in accounting principles; by liquidity needs driving repatriations of non-U.S. cash to the U.S.; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, including possible U.S. changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules.
The Company’s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign tax rates, tax credits, the domestic manufacturing deduction, tax audit settlements and valuation allowance adjustments.
Significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions, determining valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets, and ultimately, the income tax provision.
It is difficult to predict when resolution of income tax matters will occur and when recognition of certain income tax assets and liabilities is appropriate, and the Company’s income tax expense in the future may continue to differ from the statutory rate because of the effects of similar items.
For example, if items are favorably resolved or management determines a deferred tax asset is realizable that was previously reserved, the Company will recognize period tax benefits.
Conversely, to the extent tax matters are unfavorably resolved or management determines a valuation allowance is necessary for a tax asset that was not previously reserved, the Company will recognize incremental period tax expense.
These matters are expected to contribute to the tax rate differing from the statutory rate and continued volatility in the Company’s effective tax rate.
See Footnote 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Pensions and Postretirement Benefits The Company records annual amounts relating to its pension and postretirement plans based on calculations, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates.
The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so.
The effect of modifications is generally deferred and amortized over future periods.
The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience, market conditions and the input from its actuaries and investment advisors.
The pension and postretirement obligations are measured as of December 31 for 2017 and 2016.
The Company employs a total return investment approach for its pension and postretirement benefit plans whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of pension plan assets.
The intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by outperforming plan liabilities over the long run.
Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition.
The investment portfolios contain a diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments.
Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across geography and market capitalization through investments in U.S. large-capitalization stocks, U.S. small-capitalization stocks and international securities.
Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.
41 Table of Contents The expected long-term rate of return for plan assets is based upon many factors including expected asset allocations, historical asset returns, current and expected future market conditions, risk and active management premiums.
The target asset allocations for the Company’s domestic pension plans may vary by plan, based in part due to plan demographics, funded status and liability duration.
In general, the Company’s target asset allocations for the domestic pension plans are as follows: equities approximately 25% to 40%; bonds approximately 20% to 40%; and cash, alternative investments and other, approximately 25% to 45% as of December 31, 2017.
Actual asset allocations may vary from the targeted allocations for various reasons, including market conditions and the timing of transactions.
The Company maintains numerous international defined benefit pension plans.
The asset allocations for the international investment may vary by plan and jurisdiction and are primarily based upon the plan structure and plan participant profile.
At December 31, 2017, the domestic plan assets were allocated as follows: Equities: approximately 23% and Other Investments (alternative investments, fixed-income securities, cash and other): approximately 77%.
Cash and other asset levels were higher than normal at December 31, 2017, due to the impending merger of domestic defined benefit pension plans effective January 1, 2018, and the liquidation of certain assets in advance of the merger.
These assets were subsequently invested in January 2018 in accordance with the Company’s target asset allocations.
For 2017, 2016 and 2015, the actual return (loss) on plan assets for the Company’s U.S. pension plan assets was approximately $172 million, $71 million and $(14) million, respectively, versus an expected return on plan assets of approximately $73 million, $69 million and $58 million, respectively.
The actual amount of future contributions will depend, in part, on long-term actual return on assets and future discount rates.
Pension contributions for all the Company’s pension plans for 2018 are estimated to be approximately $30 million, compared to approximately $29 million in 2017.
The weighted average expected return on plan assets assumption for 2017 was approximately 4.9% for the Company’s pension plans.
The weighted average discount rate at the 2017 measurement date used to measure the pension and postretirement benefit obligations was approximately 3.1% and 3.3%, respectively.
A 25 basis points decrease in the discount rate at the 2017 measurement date would increase the pension plans’ projected benefit obligation by approximately $71 million.
The healthcare cost trend rates used in valuing the Company’s postretirement benefit obligation are established based upon actual healthcare cost trends and consultation with actuaries and benefit providers.
At the 2017 measurement date, the current weighted average healthcare cost trend rate assumption was approximately 6.7%.
The current healthcare cost trend rate gradually decreases to an ultimate healthcare cost trend rate of 4.5%.
A one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would not have a material effect on the postretirement benefit obligation or the service and interest cost components of postretirement benefit costs.
See Footnote 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans.
Restructuring The Company has and expects to continue to engage in restructuring activities, which requires management to utilize significant estimates related to the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reductions and other separation programs, realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete, lease cancellation costs, sublease income and other exit costs, including environmental and legal contingencies associated with restructuring activities.
The Company accrues for severance and other employee separation costs under these activities when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable.
The rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans, historical experience and previously negotiated settlements.
The Company accrues for future lease costs, net of management’s estimate for future sublease income, when the leased property has been vacated and is no longer being used.
When estimating the costs of exiting facilities, estimates are made regarding future sublease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results and result in additional restructuring costs in future periods.
Environmental and legal contingencies associated with restructuring activities are accrued when the liability is probable of being incurred and is estimable.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Footnote 1—Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies—Recent Accounting Pronouncements.” International Operations For 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company’s non-U.S. businesses accounted for approximately 29%, 28% and 27% of net sales, respectively (see Footnote 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk In general, business enterprises can be exposed to market risks including fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices, and that can affect the cost of operating, investing and financing under those conditions.
The Company believes it has moderate exposure to these risks.
The Company assesses market risk based on changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates and commodity prices utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential loss in earnings, fair values and cash flows based on hypothetical changes in rates and prices.
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its variable rate debt and price risk on its fixed rate debt.
As such, the Company monitors the interest rate environment and uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk and price risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable interest rates while attempting to minimize interest costs.
As of December 31, 2017, approximately $1.1 billion of the Company’s debt carries a variable rate of interest either by nature or through the use of interest rate swaps.
The remainder of the debt (approximately $9.4 billion) carries a fixed rate of interest.
Based upon the Company’s debt structure at December 31, 2017, a hypothetical 1% increase in these interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately $11 million and decrease the fair values of debt by approximately $743 million.
While the Company transacts business predominantly in U.S. dollars and most of its revenues are collected in U.S. dollars, a substantial portion of the Company’s operating costs are denominated in other currencies, such as the Brazilian Real, British Pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese Renminbi, European Euro, Japanese Yen and Mexican Peso.
Changes in the relation of these and other currencies to the U.S. dollar will affect Company’s sales and profitability and could result in exchange losses.
For 2017, approximately 29% of the Company’s sales were denominated in foreign currencies, the most significant of which were: European Euro-approximately 8.0%; and Canadian dollar-approximately 5.8%.
The primary purpose of the Company’s foreign currency hedging activities is to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate exposure on the cash flows related to forecasted inventory purchases and sales.
A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on foreign currency gains and losses related to the foreign currency derivatives or the net fair value of the Company’s foreign currency derivatives.
The Company is exposed to the price risk that the rising cost of commodities has on certain of its raw materials.
As such, the Company monitors the commodities markets and from time to time the Company enters into commodity-based derivatives in order to mitigate the impact that the rising price of these commodities has on the cost of certain of the Company’s raw materials.
A hypothetical 10% change in the commodity prices underlying the derivatives would not have a material effect on the related gains and losses included in the Company’s results of operations.
In this sensitivity analysis, all other assumptions are constant and assumes that a change in one currency’s rate relative to the U.S. dollar would not impact another currency’s rates relative to the U.S. dollar.
The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to its derivative financial instruments, all of which are highly rated institutions; however, the Company does not anticipate non-performance by such counterparties.
The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
