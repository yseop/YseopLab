ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
The discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.Business OverviewNewell Brands is a global marketer of consumer and commercial products that help people get more out of life every day, where they live, learn, work and play.
Our products are marketed under a strong portfolio of leading brands, including Paper Mate®, Sharpie®, Dymo®, Expo®, Parker®, Elmer’s®, Coleman®, Jostens®, Marmot®, Rawlings®, Irwin®, Lenox®, Oster®, Sunbeam®, FoodSaver®, Mr. Coffee®, Rubbermaid Commercial Products®, Graco®, Baby Jogger®, NUK®, Calphalon®, Rubbermaid®, Contigo®, First Alert®, Waddington and Yankee Candle®.Acquisition of Jarden Corporation On April 15, 2016, Jarden Corporation (“Jarden”) became a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Newell Brands, as a result of a series of merger transactions (the “Jarden Acquisition”).
The Jarden Acquisition was effected pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 13, 2015 (the “Merger Agreement”) between the Company, Jarden and two wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company.
Following the Jarden Acquisition, the Company was renamed Newell Brands Inc. Jarden is a leading, global consumer products company with leading brands such as Yankee Candle®, Crock-Pot®, FoodSaver®, Mr. Coffee®, Oster®, Coleman®, First Alert®, Rawlings®, Jostens®, K2®, Marker®, Marmot®, Völkl® and many others.
This transformative transaction created a global consumer goods company named Newell Brands with estimated annual pro forma sales for 2016 of $16 billion and a portfolio of leading brands in large, growing, unconsolidated, global markets.
The scaled enterprise is expected to accelerate profitable growth with leading brands in a global market that exceeds $100 billion, with business and capability development supported by the efficiencies of the combined company.
Management believes the scale of Newell Brands in key categories, channels and geographies creates a much broader opportunity to deploy the Company’s advantaged set of brand development and commercial capabilities for accelerated growth and margin expansion.
The Company’s intent is to design a benchmarked, efficient set of structures that support long-term business development.
The Company anticipates incremental annualized cost synergies of at least $500 million over four years, driven by efficiencies of scale and new efficiencies in procurement, cost to serve and infrastructure that the combination unlocks.
The Company currently expects to incur approximately $500 million of restructuring and integration-related costs over the same period to generate and unlock the more than $500 million of annualized cost synergies.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each share of Jarden common stock was converted into the right to receive and became exchangeable for merger consideration consisting of (1) 0.862 of a share of the Company’s common stock plus (2) $21.00 in cash.
On April 15, 2016, the Company provided for the issuance of up to 189.4 million shares of common stock and the payment of up to $4.6 billion for 100% of the outstanding equity interests of Jarden, which consisted of 219.7 million shares of Jarden common stock outstanding and eligible to receive the merger consideration.
Based on the closing price of a share of the Company’s common stock on April 15, 2016 of $44.33 per share and after conversion of substantially all of Jarden’s convertible notes, the total consideration paid or payable for shares of Jarden common stock was approximately $15.3 billion, including $5.4 billion of cash and $9.9 billion of common stock.
Stockholders of Newell Rubbermaid and former Jarden stockholders (including holders of Jarden convertible notes) owned 55% and 45%, respectively, of Newell Brands upon completion of the merger.
The Company paid $5.2 billion in addition to $4.1 billion for the repayment of certain Jarden debt, net of $661.9 million of cash acquired.
A total of $222.2 million in cash otherwise payable in connection with the acquisition has not been paid as of December 31, 2016, as this amount was payable in respect of shareholders who have exercised their judicial rights of appraisal under Delaware law.
The total merger consideration otherwise payable to the dissenting stockholders was approximately $626.5 million based on the Company’s stock price as of the closing date.The Company financed the $5.4 billion cash portion of the merger consideration and the repayment of $4.1 billion of outstanding Jarden debt with proceeds from the issuance of $8.0 billion of medium-term and long-term notes in March 2016 and $1.5 billion of borrowings under a term loan facility.
See Footnote 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
The Company is committed to maintaining its investment grade credit rating by using strong cash flow from the combined enterprise to prioritize debt reduction in the short term, while simultaneously investing in the Company’s growth platforms and maintaining its dividend per share.
27Table of ContentsThe Jarden Acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and Jarden’s assets, liabilities and results of operations are included in the Company’s financial statements from the acquisition date of April 15, 2016. Business Strategy During 2016, the Company launched the New Growth Game Plan, which is its strategy to simplify the organization and free up resources to invest in growth initiatives and strengthened capabilities in support of the Company’s brands.
The changes being implemented in the execution of the New Growth Game Plan are considered key enablers to building a bigger, faster-growing, more global and more profitable company.As part of the New Growth Game Plan, in late 2016 the Company began to transform from a holding company to an operating company, consolidating its business units into global divisions while investing to extend its design, innovation and brand development capabilities across a broader set of categories.
These organization changes were initiated in the third quarter and this major phase of the transformation was completed by year end.
These new global divisions will become the key commercial nodes in the Company, including a new Global eCommerce Division, which will have responsibility for all ecommerce activity across the enterprise.The divisions will generally align to the four areas of strategic focus for the Company of Live, Learn, Work, and Play.
The new structure will be effective January 1, 2017.

Market and Performance OverviewThe Company operates in the consumer and commercial products markets, which are generally impacted by overall economic conditions in the regions in which the Company operates.
The following is a summary of the Company’s results for the year ended 2016:•Reported net sales increased 124.2%.
Net sales were favorably impacted by volume growth, pricing, the acquisition of Elmer’s, and the Jarden Acquisition, which, contributed a 123.3% increase in net sales.
Net sales were adversely impacted by foreign currency, divestitures and the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations on December 31, 2015.
Reported net sales increased 125.4%, 180.7%, 57.6% and 93.0% in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific, respectively, primarily due to the Jarden Acquisition.•Gross margin was 33.2%, a decline of 580 basis points compared to the prior year period.
The decline was primarily due to the negative impact of the $479.5 million inventory step-up for the Jarden Acquisition that is included in cost of products sold for the year ended December 31, 2016, foreign currency, mix from the deconsolidation of Venezuela and mix from acquisitions, including the Jarden Acquisition, which were partially offset by the benefits of synergies, productivity and pricing.
29Table of Contents•Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) increased $1,647.2 million to $3,221.1 million, due primarily to the SG&A of the Jarden business from the acquisition date and costs associated with the Jarden Acquisition.
SG&A also increased due to increases in advertising and promotion in support of the Company’s brands and innovation, costs associated with increased incentive and other compensation and costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Jarden.
These costs were partially offset by a reduction in overhead costs due to Project Renewal initiatives, costs associated with the Graco product recall in the prior year period and the impacts of foreign currency.The Company’s advertising and promotion strategy is to invest behind innovation, including new product launches, and in building brands.
During 2016, the Company increased advertising and promotion investments by $24.5 million (excluding the impacts of the Jarden Acquisition).
The Company plans to continue increasing advertising and promotion in support of its brands to drive growth.
The Company’s investments in brand-building and consumer demand creation and commercialization activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 included the following:•advertising campaigns supporting Paper Mate® InkJoy® gel pens as well as Prismacolor® and Mr. Sketch® color pencils and markers in art and coloring;•continued advertising support for Sharpie® markers and highlighters, including Sharpie Clear View® highlighters which have a unique, see through tip for more precise highlighting;•advertising campaigns supporting the launch of Rubbermaid® FreshWorksTM, our latest food storage innovation;•advertising support for Calphalon® self-sharpening cutlery with SharpInTM technology, which makes knives stay sharp for a life-time;•advertising for the Graco 4Ever® All-in-One convertible car seat, Extend2FitTM car seat, and Aprica® Fladea car seat; and•advertising for Yankee Candle in the fourth quarter of 2016.•The Company continued the execution of Project Renewal and initiated projects to integrate Elmer’s and merge the legacy Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden operations, resulting in $74.9 million of restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2016.•The Company completed the offering and sale of $8.0 billion principal amount of unsecured senior notes in March 2016 and entered into and expanded other financing arrangements during the first half of 2016.
The proceeds were used in April 2016 to finance the Jarden Acquisition, which included $5.2 billion for the cash portion of the merger consideration and $4.1 billion to repay certain Jarden debt obligations.
As a result of these financing activities, a commitment by Goldman Sachs & Co. to fund the $10.5 billion senior unsecured bridge facility (the “Jarden Bridge Facility”) was terminated during the first half of 2016, and the Company repaid $1.1 billion of the $1.5 billion of borrowings under a term loan facility, resulting in a $47.6 million loss on extinguishment of debt.•The Company completed the divestiture of the Décor business, which resulted in $223.5 million of consideration, net of fees, and a pretax gain on the sale of the business of $160.2 million.
The proceeds from the sale of the Décor business were used to repay debt.•The Company reported an effective tax rate of 35.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 23.2% in 2015.
The tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was impacted by the Jarden Acquisition and the resulting change in the geographical mix in earnings as well as a deferred tax charge of $164.2 million associated with the book and tax basis difference related to the pending Tools divestiture.
The tax rate was offset in the current year by a deferred tax benefit of $40.0 million related to statutory tax rate changes in France that primarily affected deferred taxes on Jarden acquired intangible assets and a reduction in the valuation allowance of $17.9 million related to certain deferred tax assets of the Company’s UK operations.
The tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was impacted by the geographical mix of earnings, the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies and the implied tax rate associated with the $7.6 million income tax benefit on the $172.7 million Venezuela deconsolidation charge, which were partially offset by benefits from the impact of increased foreign tax credits.
•The Company added members to the Newell Brands executive management team to lead the combined business, relocated its headquarters to Hoboken, New Jersey and opened its new office building for the Atlanta business hub in Atlanta, Georgia.•On October 3, 2016, the Company and Jarden Receivables, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Jarden Receivables”), entered into a loan and servicing agreement and related receivables sale and contribution agreement and 30Table of Contentsperformance undertaking (collectively, the “New Receivables Facility”) in order to, among other things, replace the Company's existing $400.0 million receivables facility (the "Receivables Facility") and Jarden's $500.0 million receivables purchase agreement (the "Jarden Securitization Facility") with a new $950.0 million, three-year securitization program.•On October 12, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the Tools business for an estimated sale price of $1.95 billion, subject to working capital adjustments.

Key InitiativesProject RenewalDuring April 2015, the Company committed to a further expansion of Project Renewal (the “April 2015 Expansion”), a program initially launched in October 2011 to reduce the complexity of the organization and increase investment in growth platforms within the business, funded by a reduction in structural SG&A costs.
Project Renewal is designed to simplify and align the business around two key activities — Brand & Category Development and Market Execution & Delivery.
Project Renewal encompasses projects centered around five work streams:•Organizational Simplification: The Company de-layered its top structure and further consolidated its businesses from nine Global Business Units (“GBUs”) to three operating groups that manage five operating segments.•EMEA Simplification: The Company is focusing its resources on fewer products and countries, while simplifying go-to-market, delivery and back office support structures.•Best Cost Finance: The Company is delivering a simplified approach to decision support, transaction processing and information management by leveraging SAP and the streamlined business segments to align resources with the Growth Game Plan.
31Table of Contents•Best Cost Back Office: The Company is driving “One Newell” efficiencies in customer and consumer services and sourcing functions.
•Supply Chain Footprint: The Company is further optimizing manufacturing and distribution facilities across its global supply chain.
Through Project Renewal, the Company was realigned from a holding company comprised of global business units, each with its own support structure, to an operating company with three operating groups that manage five operating segments.
The operating company structure is centered around four primary capabilities: Design; Marketing & Insight; Supply Chain; and Customer Development.
The Company has developed centers of excellence in each of these capabilities and has realigned its back office support structure functions (Human Resources, Finance/IT and Legal) to support the four primary capabilities.
This realignment has led to efficiencies and cost reductions, allowing the Company to increase investments in its brands and capabilities.
In addition, through Project Renewal, the Company has simplified its go-to-market and back office structures in EMEA which has resulted in significant Project Renewal costs and savings in the EMEA region.
Pursuant to an expansion of Project Renewal in October 2014, the Company is: (i) further streamlining its supply chain function, including reducing overhead and realigning the supply chain management structure; (ii) investing in value analysis and value engineering efforts to reduce product and packaging costs; (iii) reducing operational and manufacturing complexity in its Writing segment; and (iv) further streamlining its distribution and transportation functions.
Under the April 2015 Expansion, the Company is implementing additional activities designed to further streamline business partnering functions (e.g., Finance/IT, Legal and Human Resources), optimize global selling and trade marketing functions and rationalize the Company’s real estate portfolio.
The April 2015 Expansion is expected to generate annualized incremental overhead cost savings of approximately $150 million when fully implemented by the end of 2017, which includes savings expected to be realized during 2018 from projects completed in 2017.
In connection with the April 2015 Expansion, the Company expects to incur approximately $150 million of additional costs, including cash costs of approximately $135 million.
The additional costs include pretax restructuring charges in the range of $125 to $135 million, a majority of which are expected to be facility exit costs and employee-related cash costs, including severance, retirement and other termination benefits.Cumulative costs of the expanded Project Renewal are now expected to be approximately $690 to $725 million pretax, with cash costs of approximately $645 to $675 million.
Project Renewal in total is expected to generate annualized cost savings of approximately $620 to $675 million by the end of 2017, which includes savings expected to be realized during 2018 from projects completed in 2017.
Through December 31, 2016, the Company has realized annualized savings of approximately $510 million.
The majority of these savings have been, and the majority of future savings from Project Renewal initiatives are expected to be, reinvested in the business to strengthen brand building and selling capabilities in priority markets around the world.
Since inception of Project Renewal through December 31, 2016, the Company had incurred $319.7 million and $208.8 million of restructuring and other project-related costs, respectively.
The majority of the restructuring costs represent employee-related cash costs, including severance, retirement and other termination benefits and costs.
Other project-related costs represent organizational change implementation costs, including advisory and consultancy costs, compensation and related costs of personnel dedicated to transformation projects, and other costs associated with the implementation of Project Renewal.
Through December 31, 2016, the Company estimates it has reduced its headcount by approximately 2,900 employees as a result of Project Renewal initiatives.The following table summarizes the estimated costs and savings relating to Project Renewal, as well as the actual results through December 31, 2016 (amounts in millions): Total Project Through December 31, 2016 Remaining through December 31, 2017*Cost $690 - $725 $529 $161- $196Savings$620 - $675 $510 $110 - $165*
Includes savings expected to be realized during 2018 from projects completed in 2017.In 2016, the Company has continued to execute existing projects as well as initiate new activities relating to Project Renewal as follows:•Ongoing reconfiguration and consolidation of the Company’s manufacturing footprint and distribution centers to reduce overhead, improve operational efficiencies and better utilize existing assets, including the ongoing implementation of projects to better align the Writing segment’s worldwide supply chain footprint.
32Table of Contents•Ongoing evaluations of the Company’s overhead structure, supply chain organization and processes, customer development organization alignment, and pricing structure to optimize and transform processes, simplify the organization and reduce costs, including the implementation of technology-based solutions to better manage pricing initiatives and merchandising support.•Initiated a project to enhance the Baby & Parenting segment’s route-to-market in certain parts of North America.
•Continued implementation of plans to relocate the Company’s Atlanta business hub within Atlanta, Georgia in early 2016.
The Company moved into the new building in April 2016.
Foreign Currency - VenezuelaUntil December 31, 2015, the Company accounted for its Venezuelan operations using highly inflationary accounting, and therefore, the Company remeasured assets, liabilities, sales and expenses denominated in Bolivar Fuertes (“Bolivars”) into U.S.
Dollars using the applicable exchange rate, and the resulting translation adjustments were included in earnings.
As of December 31, 2015, the Company determined it could no longer exercise control over its Venezuela operations because the availability of U.S.
Dollars had declined significantly over the past several years in each of Venezuela’s three exchange mechanisms.
As a result, the Company deconsolidated its Venezuelan operations.
Prior to the deconsolidation of the Venezuela operations on December 31, 2015, the results of the Company’s Venezuelan operations have been included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2015 and all prior periods.
As of December 31, 2015, the Company began accounting for its investment in its Venezuelan operations using the cost method of accounting, and the cost basis was adjusted to nil as of December 31, 2015.During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Venezuelan operations generated 2.2% and 1.4% of consolidated net sales, respectively and $51.1 million and $30.0 million of the Company’s reported annual operating income, respectively.
As a result of deconsolidating its Venezuelan operations, the Company recorded a charge of $172.7 million in 2015.
The charge consisted of the write-off of the Company’s Venezuelan operations’ net assets of $74.7 million, as well as $58.3 million of Venezuela receivable-related assets held by other subsidiaries, resulting in $133.0 million of total charges associated with the deconsolidation of Venezuela’s net assets.
In addition, in accordance with applicable accounting standards for foreign currency and the transition to the cost method for Venezuela’s operations, the Company was required to write-off the currency translation adjustment that arose prior to the application of hyperinflationary accounting in 2010 that was included in other comprehensive loss in equity.
The write-off of the currency translation adjustment resulted in a pre-tax charge of $39.7 million.
The Company plans to continue operating its business in Venezuela.
Since the Company holds all of the equity interests but does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the Venezuela entity’s economic performance, the Company considers the Venezuela entity a variable interest entity for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary.
The Company has determined that the Venezuela entity’s assets can only be used to settle its obligations.
As of December 31, 2016, the Company has no outstanding exposures or commitments with respect to its Venezuelan operations.
Further, dividends and payments for intercompany receivables due from the Company’s Venezuelan operations will be recorded as other income upon receipt.

The Jarden Acquisition contributed $7,296.9 million of the increase in net sales, or 123.3% of the increase.
Net sales were also favorably impacted by volume growth, pricing and the acquisition of Elmer’s.
Net sales were adversely impacted by foreign currency, divestitures and the deconsolidation of the Company’s Venezuelan operations on December 31, 2015.Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 33.2%, or $4,398.8 million, compared to 39.0%, or $2,304.6 million, for the year ended December 31, 2015.
The 580 basis point decline was driven primarily by the negative impact of the $479.5 million charge for the inventory step-up related to the Jarden Acquisition, foreign currency, and mix effect of the Jarden Acquisition and deconsolidation of Venezuela, partially offset by the benefits of productivity, input cost deflation and pricing.SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were 24.3% of net sales, or $3,221.1 million, versus 26.6% of net sales, or $1,573.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2015.
The $1,647.2 million increase was primarily driven by the SG&A associated with the Jarden business.
The increase was also driven by $261.3 million of costs during the year ended December 31, 2016 associated with the acquisition and integration of Jarden and an increase in incentive-related and other compensation costs.
These increases were partially offset by overhead cost savings from Project Renewal, $10.0 million of SG&A costs associated with the Graco product recall during the year ended December 31, 2015, a $41.5 million decrease in Project Renewal-related SG&A costs, which decreased from $78.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $36.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and the impacts of foreign currency.The Company recorded restructuring costs of $74.9 million and $77.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily related to the integration of Jarden and Project Renewal and consisted mostly of employee severance, termination benefits and employee relocation costs.
The restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to Project Renewal and consisted of $6.7 million of facility and other exit costs, including impairments, $54.9 million of employee severance, termination benefits and employee relocation costs 34Table of Contentsand $15.6 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs.
See Footnote 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1,100.1 million, or 8.3% of net sales, versus $601.4 million, or 10.2% of net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2015.
The 190 basis point decrease in operating margin was primarily attributable to the $479.5 million charge for the inventory step-up related to the Jarden Acquisition and the $261.3 million of SG&A costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Jarden.
Net nonoperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $285.6 million versus $263.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $404.5 million, compared to $79.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, reflecting the impact of higher overall borrowings used to finance the Jarden Acquisition in April 2016 and the Elmer’s acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Nonoperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 include $47.6 million of costs associated with the termination of the Jarden Bridge Facility and the partial repayment of the term loan facility.
This was offset by the gain on the sale of the Décor business of $160.2 million.
The Company reported an effective tax rate of 35.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 23.2% in 2015.
The tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was impacted by the Jarden Acquisition and the resulting change in the geographical mix in earnings as well as a deferred tax charge of $164.2 million associated with the book and tax basis difference related to the pending Tools divestiture.
The tax rate was offset in the current year by a deferred tax benefit of $40.0 million related to statutory tax rate changes in France that primarily affected deferred taxes on Jarden acquired intangible assets and a reduction in the valuation allowance of $17.9 million related to certain deferred tax assets of the Company’s UK operations.
The tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was impacted by the geographical mix of earnings, the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies and the implied tax rate associated with the $7.6 million income tax benefit on the $172.7 million Venezuela deconsolidation charge, which were partially offset by benefits from the impact of increased foreign tax credits.
Results of Operations — 2015 vs. 2014 Net sales for 2015 were $5,915.7 million, representing an increase of $188.7 million, or 3.3%, from $5,727.0 million for 2014.
Acquisitions drove a 4.7% increase in net sales along with growth in North America across all five segments, with strong sales growth in the Writing, Commercial Products and Baby & Parenting segments as well as favorable impacts of additional sell-in in advance of advertising and marketing support planned for 2016.
Negative foreign exchange more than offset Latin America’s improved pricing and volumes, EMEA’s growth in Writing, Commercial Products and Tools segments and Asia Pacific’s growth in Baby & Parenting and Commercial Products segments.Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, for 2015 was 39.0%, or $2,304.6 million, compared to 38.5%, or $2,203.4 million, for 2014, as the benefits of productivity, pricing, the adverse impact of the Graco product recall on the prior year’s results and lower input costs (including resin) more than offset the impacts of unfavorable foreign currency and sourced product, labor and other input cost inflation.
SG&A expenses for 2015 were 26.6% of net sales, or $1,573.9 million, versus 25.9% of net sales, or $1,480.5 million, for 2014.
SG&A expenses increased $93.4 million as a result of a $42.3 million increase in advertising and promotion investments, primarily relating to the Writing segment’s continued investment in advertising in North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific and increased advertising in the Tools, Commercial Products and Baby & Parenting segments.
The increase was also driven by a $36.1 million year-over-year increase in Project Renewal related costs, including advisory costs for process transformation and optimization initiatives, which increased from $41.9 million for 2014 to $78.0 million for 2015.
The increase was also attributable to $55.5 million of incremental SG&A expenses of Ignite, bubba, Baby Jogger and Elmer’s and a $30.7 million increase in annual incentive compensation expense.
These increases were partially offset by the impacts of foreign currency and overhead cost savings from Project Renewal, which includes an estimated $8.0 million of annual costs for personnel that transitioned to the Transformation Office at the beginning of 2015 and are included in Project Renewal related costs in 2015.In 2015 and 2014, the Company offered certain U.S. pension plan participants who have deferred vested benefits under the Company’s U.S. pension plan the opportunity to make a one-time election to receive a lump sum distribution of the present value of their benefits.
Based on participants that accepted the offers, the Company paid $70.6 million and $98.6 million of lump sum distributions from plan assets in 2015 and 2014, respectively, which resulted in $52.1 million and $65.4 million of non-cash settlement charges during the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively.
The Company recorded restructuring costs of $77.2 million and $52.8 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively.
The year-over-year increase in restructuring costs is primarily a result of larger projects being initiated in North America in 2015 associated with reducing structural overhead costs.
The restructuring costs for 2015 primarily related to Project Renewal and consisted of $6.7 million of facility and other exit costs, including impairments, $54.9 million of employee severance, termination benefits and employee relocation costs and $15.6 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs.
The restructuring 35Table of Contentscosts in 2014 primarily related to Project Renewal and consisted of $7.5 million of facility and other exit costs, including impairments, $22.9 million of employee severance, termination benefits and employee relocation costs and $22.4 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs.
See Footnote 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Operating income for 2015 was $601.4 million, or 10.2% of net sales, versus $604.7 million, or 10.6% of net sales, for 2014.
The 40 basis point decline in operating margin was primarily attributable to a 70 basis point increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, which, as explained above, includes the impact of increased advertising and promotion spend, and increased restructuring costs, partially offset by a 50 basis point increase in gross margin.Net nonoperating expenses for 2015 were $263.9 million versus $142.6 million for 2014.
Interest expense for 2015 was $79.9 million, compared to $60.4 million for 2014.
The increase is attributable to interest expense incurred during 2015 in connection with the bridge loan related to the acquisition of Elmer’s and the overall impact of higher overall borrowings to finance the acquisition of Elmer’s during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the acquisitions of Ignite, bubba and Baby Jogger in the second half of 2014.
Nonoperating expenses in 2015 included a charge of $172.7 million associated with deconsolidating the Company’s Venezuelan operations.
These increases in nonoperating expenses were partially offset by the year-over-year decrease in foreign exchange losses associated with the adoption of and declines in the SICAD exchange rate used to remeasure the net monetary assets of the Company’s Venezuelan operations, which declined from $45.6 million during 2014 to $9.2 million during 2015, and the $33.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt incurred in 2014 associated with the repayment of $439.4 million principal amount of medium-term notes.The Company recognized an effective income tax rate of 23.2% for 2015, which compared to an effective income tax rate of 19.3% for 2014.
During 2015, the Company’s effective tax rate was adversely impacted by the geographical mix of earnings, the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies and the implied tax rate associated with the $7.6 million income tax benefit on the $172.7 million Venezuela deconsolidation charge, which were partially offset by benefits from the impact of increased foreign tax credits.
During 2014, the Company recognized discrete income tax benefits of $15.5 million related to the resolution of certain tax contingencies and $18.4 million of net income tax benefits associated with the reduction of valuation allowances on certain international deferred tax assets.For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded income of $90.7 million, net of tax, associated with discontinued operations, primarily due to the $95.6 million net gain recognized from the sale of the Endicia business.
The Company recorded income of $4.8 million, net of tax, during the year ended December 31, 2015, which primarily relates to the Company’s Hardware, Endicia and Culinary electrics and retail businesses.

The increase in net sales reflects double-digit growth in North America attributable to the Elmer’s acquisition, increased advertising and promotion, robust merchandising efforts, overall innovation-led growth, and volume and distribution gains.
The acquisition of Elmer’s contributed 11.6% of the increase in net sales, and the deconsolidation of the Venezuelan operations negatively impacted the Writing segment’s net sales by 7.3%.

The decrease in net sales was due to the timing impact of a transition of a key distribution center in the beverageware business, continued planned contraction of the lower margin Rubbermaid Consumer Storage business and partially offset by continued strong growth in the Rubbermaid food storage and beverageware businesses.
The net sales of the Décor business, which was divested on June 30, 2016, declined and negatively impacted the Home Solutions segment’s net sales.
The Home Solutions segment’s net sales were adversely impacted by foreign currency.Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $179.2 million, or 11.4% of net sales, a decrease of $59.2 million, or 24.8%, from $238.4 million, or 14.0% of net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Excluding the acquisition, North America high-single digit net sales growth attributable to innovation, advertising and promotion, and the comparison to the prior year period which reflected the impacts of the Graco harness buckle recall, and Asia Pacific sales growth attributable to innovation were partially offset by declines in EMEA resulting from softness across Europe and economic challenges in Russia as well as unfavorable foreign currency impacts.Operating income for 2015 was $55.2 million, or 6.5% of net sales, an increase of $14.6 million, or 36.0%, from $40.6 million, or 5.4% of net sales, for 2014.
The 110 basis point increase in operating margin was largely due to contributions from Baby Jogger and new product development, partially offset by increased advertising and promotion in support of innovation and the negative impact of foreign currency.
Operating income for 2015 and 2014 includes $10.2 million and $15.0 million, respectively, of costs associated with the Graco harness buckle recall.
The segment’s ability to leverage the increase in net sales associated with base business growth, the addition of Baby Jogger sales and the decrease in Graco harness buckle recall costs more than offset the increase in advertising and promotion, which resulted in SG&A decreasing 100 basis points as a percentage of net sales.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash Flows Cash and cash equivalents increased (decreased) as follows for the years ended December 31, (in millions): 2016 2015 2014Cash provided by operating activities$1,828.5 $565.8 $634.1Cash used in investing activities(8,824.8) (649.9) (751.9)Cash provided by financing activities7,340.4 172.3 119.0Currency effect on cash and cash equivalents(31.4) (12.8) (28.1)Increase in cash and cash equivalents$312.7 $75.4 $(26.9) 40Table of ContentsIn the cash flow statement, the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and reclassifications of assets and liabilities to held for sale.
Accordingly, the amounts in the cash flow statement differ from changes in the operating assets and liabilities that are presented in the balance sheets.SourcesHistorically, the Company’s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have included cash provided by operations, proceeds from divestitures, proceeds from the issuance of debt and the use of available borrowing facilities.Cash provided by operating activities for 2016 was $1,828.5 million compared to $565.8 million for 2015.
The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to the impact of the operating cash flow attributable to the Jarden Acquisition based on favorable timing of the acquisition during the second quarter, partially offset by higher interest payments associated with higher debt levels resulting from financing the Jarden Acquisition.Additionally, the Company made payments of $91.2 million during 2016 associated with the settlement of forward-starting interest rate swaps used to hedge benchmark treasury rates for the $8.0 billion public debt issuance in March 2016 used to finance the Jarden Acquisition.The Company also paid transaction costs associated with the Jarden Acquisition totaling $50.7 million, and $31.8 million of higher annual incentive compensation paid in March 2016 relating to the Company’s 2015 performance.
Cash provided by operating activities for 2015 was $565.8 million compared to $634.1 million for 2014.
The decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to the impact of the following items:•a $70.0 million voluntary contribution to the Company’s primary U.S. pension plan during 2015, which is included in accrued liabilities and other in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows;•a $69.6 million year-over-year increase in cash used to build inventories in 2015 compared to 2014, partially attributable to inventory builds in 2015 to support new product launches;•a $45.9 million year-over-year increase in project-related costs associated with Project Renewal and advisory costs for process transformation and optimization, including advisory and consulting costs and personnel costs associated with employees dedicated to Project Renewal initiatives; and•a $67.0 million year-over-year decrease in cash provided by accounts payable, primarily attributable to the timing and management of purchases and payments.partially offset by:•a $107.1 million year-over-year decrease in cash used for increases in accounts receivable due to the timing of sales in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014; and•a $60.6 million increase in the Company’s income tax liability during 2015, which is included in accrued liabilities and other in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, primarily associated with an estimated $60.0 million income tax payment due in the first quarter of 2016 associated with the gain realized on the sale of the Endicia business.During 2016, the Company had net payments of $641.4 million related to its short-term borrowing arrangements compared to net payments of $57.0 million related to short-term borrowing arrangements in 2015.
The net payments of $57.0 million related to short-term borrowing arrangements in 2015 primarily relates to $50.3 million of issuance costs incurred in connection with a $400 million bridge facility the Company entered into in advance of the Elmer’s acquisition (the “Elmer’s Bridge Facility”), which has since been terminated, and a $10.5 billion bridge facility contemplated by the commitment letter that the Company entered into with Goldman Sachs & Co. in connection with the Jarden Acquisition (the “Jarden Bridge Facility”), which has been terminated.
The Company’s short-term borrowings, which include commercial paper and the receivables facility, were $601.9 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $388.8 million at December 31, 2015.
During 2014, the Company received net proceeds of $217.3 million on its short-term borrowing arrangements compared to net payments of $35.8 million related to short-term borrowing arrangements in 2013.
The Company’s short-term borrowings, which include commercial paper and the receivables facility, were $390.7 million at December 31, 2014 compared to $174.0 million at December 31, 2013.
The increase in short-term borrowings in 2014 is primarily due to borrowings to fund the Company’s ongoing share repurchase program and to finance acquisitions.
In March 2016, the Company completed the offering and sale of $8.0 billion principal amount of unsecured senior notes, consisting of $1.0 billion of aggregate principal amount of 2.60% notes due March 2019 (the “2019 Notes”), $1.0 billion of aggregate 41Table of Contentsprincipal amount of 3.15% notes due April 2021 (the “2021 Notes”), $1.75 billion of aggregate principal amount of 3.85% notes due April 2023 (the “2023 Notes”), $2.0 billion of aggregate principal amount of 4.20% notes due April 2026 (the “2026 Notes”), $500.0 million of aggregate principal amount of 5.375% notes due April 2036 (the “2036 Notes”) and $1.75 billion of aggregate principal amount of 5.50% notes due April 2046 (the “2046 Notes” and together with the 2019 Notes, the 2021 Notes, the 2023 Notes, the 2026 Notes and the 2036 Notes, the “Notes”).
In April 2016, the Company borrowed $1.5 billion pursuant to a senior unsecured term loan facility with a syndicate of banks (the “Term Loan Facility”).
The aggregate net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes and Term Loan Facility of $9.4 billion were used in April 2016 to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration in the Jarden Acquisition and to repay certain of Jarden’s outstanding debt at closing.
The Company repaid $1.1 billion of the Term Loan Facility during 2016.In October 2015, the Company completed the offering and sale of $600.0 million of medium-term notes, consisting of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.15% notes due 2018 (the “2018 Notes”) and $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.90% notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”).
The aggregate net proceeds from the issuance of the medium-term notes were $594.5 million, which were used for the acquisition of Elmer’s and for general corporate purposes.
In November 2014, the Company completed the offering and sale of $850.0 million of medium-term notes, consisting of $350.0 million principal amount of 2.875% notes due 2019 (the “2019 Notes”) and $500.0 million principal amount of 4.0% notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”).
The aggregate net proceeds were $841.8 million and were used to repay $439.4 million principal amount of medium-term notes and to repay short-term borrowings incurred in connection with the acquisitions of Ignite, bubba and Baby Jogger.
During 2016, the Company generated $247.8 million of proceeds from the sale of divested businesses and fixed assets, which primarily represents the $226.3 million of net proceeds, excluding fees, from the divestiture of the Décor business.
The proceeds from the sale of the Décor business were used to repay debt.During 2015, the Company sold its Endicia business for aggregate net proceeds of $208.7 million.
The Company recognized a pretax gain of $154.2 million, with related tax expense of $58.6 million.
The related tax expense primarily represents an income tax liability which was paid and included as a use of cash in the Company’s cash flow from operating activities in the first quarter of 2016.During 2016, the Company received $9.6 million in connection with the exercise of employee stock options, which compares to $24.3 million received in 2015 and $76.6 million received in 2014.
During 2016, the Company used $22.2 million to repurchase its common stock to satisfy employees’ tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units, which compares to $30.0 million and $15.9 million used in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
UsesHistorically, the Company’s primary uses of liquidity and capital resources have included capital expenditures, payments on debt, dividend payments, share repurchases and acquisitions.Capital expenditures were $441.4 million, $211.4 million and $161.9 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Capital expenditures incurred for capitalized software projects included in capital expenditures were $34.3 million, $38.8 million and $20.8 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
The increase in capital expenditures in 2016 was largely attributable to purchases of equipment in the U.S. to support the consolidation of facilities in the Commercial Products segment, investments in assets to improve the Company’s resin manufacturing network in the Home Solutions and Commercial Products segments, the purchase of the Company’s new headquarters building, sales and marketing-related software initiatives and the implementation of SAP in Asia Pacific.During 2016, the Company completed the Jarden Acquisition.
The total consideration consisted of $5.4 billion in cash in addition to $9.9 billion of the Company’s common stock.
The Company paid $5.2 billion in addition to $4.1 billion for the repayment of certain Jarden debt, net of $661.9 million of cash acquired.
A total of $222.2 million in cash otherwise payable in connection with the acquisition has not been paid as of December 31, 2016.
This amount was payable (along with the equity portion of the merger consideration) to the former holders of 10.6 million Jarden shares who have exercised their judicial rights of appraisal under Delaware law.
Absent consent by the Company, these dissenting shareholders are no longer entitled to the merger consideration, but are instead entitled only to the judicially determined fair value of their shares, plus interest accruing from the date of the Jarden Acquisition, payable in cash.
However, it is possible that the Company could issue a consent to or reach agreement with one or more of these shareholders resulting in the issuance of Company shares (in lieu of or along with the payment of cash) in settlement of the dissenters’ claims.
During 2016, the Company repaid $1.1 billion of borrowings under the Term Loan Facility.
42Table of ContentsDuring 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Elmer’s.
The purchase price of $571.4 million is net of $16.8 million of cash acquired and is subject to customary working capital adjustments and was paid from proceeds received from the issuance of the 2018 Notes and 2025 Notes.During 2014, the Company completed the acquisitions of Ignite and Baby Jogger and acquired the assets of bubba.
The total net purchase price for these three businesses in 2014 was $602.3 million, which was paid from proceeds received from the issuance of the 2019 Notes and 2024 Notes and short-term borrowings.
During 2015, the Company deconsolidated its Venezuelan operations, which resulted in a $97.5 million reduction in cash and cash equivalents.
During 2014, the Company used aggregate net proceeds of $841.8 million from the issuance of the 2019 Notes and 2024 Notes and short-term borrowings to redeem $168.7 million of the $550.0 million outstanding 4.7% medium-term notes due 2020, redeem the $250.0 million of outstanding 2.0% medium-term notes due 2015, redeem the $20.7 million of outstanding 10.6% medium-term notes due 2019, finance acquisitions and for general corporate purposes.Aggregate dividends paid were $328.6 million, $206.3 million and $182.5 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
In February 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a 12% increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.17 per share to $0.19 per share, effective with the quarterly dividend paid in March 2015.
The Company’s Board of Directors previously approved a 13.3% increase in the Company’s quarterly dividend from $0.15 per share to $0.17 per share, effective with the quarterly dividend paid in June 2014.Under the Company’s stock repurchase program (“SRP”), which expires at the end of 2017, the Company may repurchase its own shares of common stock through a combination of 10b5-1 automatic trading plans, discretionary market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions.
During 2016, the Company did not repurchase shares.
During 2015 and 2014, the Company repurchased approximately 4.5 million and 11.3 million shares, respectively, of its common stock under its existing stock repurchase program (“SRP”) valued at approximately $180.4 million and $363.2 million, respectively.
At December 31, 2016, approximately $255.9 million remains available under the Stock Repurchase Program.Cash used for restructuring activities was $59.9 million, $51.5 million and $71.8 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and is included in the cash provided by operating activities.
These payments relate primarily to employee severance, termination benefits and relocation costs and vacant facility lease payments.The Company made contributions of $34.5 million, $103.2 million and $34.9 million to its defined benefit plans for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
The contributions are included in cash provided by operating activities.
Cash Conversion CycleThe Company defines its cash conversion cycle as the sum of inventory and accounts receivable days outstanding (based on cost of products sold and net sales, respectively, for the most recent three-month period, including discontinued operations) minus accounts payable days outstanding (based on cost of products sold for the most recent three-month period, including discontinued operations) at the end of the year.
The following table depicts the Company’s cash conversion cycle at December 31, (in number of days): 2016 2015 2014Accounts receivable64 73 74Inventory85 71 67Accounts payable(56) (64) (64)Cash conversion cycle93 80 77The decrease in accounts receivable and accounts payable days and increase in inventory days from 2015 to 2016 is attributable to the inclusion of the Jarden business and the timing of the closing of the Jarden Acquisition with respect to sales, cash receipts, purchases and payments.
The increase in the cash conversion cycle from 2015 to 2014 is primarily due to the increase in inventory days, driven by higher inventory balances at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014, largely attributable to inventory builds for new product launches.
The decrease in accounts payable days in 2016 compared to 2015 and 2014 is attributable to the timing and management of purchases and payments.The acquisition of Elmer’s and divestiture of Endicia had the effect of increasing the cash conversion cycle by approximately 1 day in 2015 due to the timing of the transactions in the fourth quarter of 2015.
The Company’s cash conversion cycle is impacted 43Table of Contentsby the seasonality of its businesses and generally tends to be longer in the first and second quarters, based on historical trends, due to inventory build-ups early in the year for seasonal sales activity and credit terms provided to customers.
Financial PositionThe Company is committed to maintaining a strong financial position through maintaining sufficient levels of available liquidity, managing working capital and monitoring the Company’s overall capitalization.
•Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016 were $587.5 million, and the Company had $1.21 billion of total available borrowing capacity under the $1.25 billion unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility and $756.0 million of borrowing capacity under the $950.0 million receivables facility.
•Working capital at December 31, 2016 was $3.2 billion compared to $504.9 million at December 31, 2015, and the current ratio at December 31, 2016 was 1.74:1 compared to 1.25:1 at December 31, 2015.
The improvement in working capital and the current ratio is primarily attributable to increased long-term borrowings to finance the cash requirements associated with the Jarden Acquisition.•The Company monitors its overall capitalization by evaluating net debt to total capitalization.
Net debt to total capitalization is defined as the sum of short- and long-term debt, less cash, divided by the sum of total debt and stockholders’ equity, less cash.
Net debt to total capitalization decreased to 0.50:1 at December 31, 2016 from 0.60:1 at December 31, 2015.
The decrease in net debt to total capitalization is primarily attributable to $9.5 billion of borrowings to finance the Jarden Acquisition offset by the $661.9 million of cash acquired in the Jarden Acquisition and the issuance of shares for the Jarden Acquisition valued at $9.5 billion.
The Company has from time to time refinanced, redeemed or repurchased its debt and taken other steps to reduce its debt or lease obligations or otherwise improve its overall financial position and balance sheet.
Going forward, depending on market conditions, its cash positions and other considerations, the Company may continue to take such actions.
Borrowing ArrangementsThe Company maintains a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility that matures in January 2022 (the “Facility”).
Under the Facility, the Company may borrow funds on a variety of interest rate terms.
The Facility also provides for the issuance of up to $100.0 million of letters of credit, so long as there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the Facility.
At December 31, 2016, net availability under the Facility was approximately $1.21 billion.In October 2016, the Company entered into a new $950.0 million receivables purchase agreement (the “Securitization Facility”) that matures in October 2019 and bears interest at a margin over a variable interest rate.
The Securitization Facility replaced the Company’s existing Receivable Facility and Jarden Securitization Facility.
Under the Securitization Facility, on an ongoing basis certain operating subsidiaries will sell their receivables to a special purpose entity Jarden Receivables, LLC (“Jarden Receivables”), which is a wholly-owned consolidated indirect subsidiary of the Company.
Jarden Receivables funds these purchases with borrowings under a loan agreement, which are secured by the accounts receivable.
There is no recourse to the Company for the unpaid portion of any loans under this loan agreement.
At December 31, 2016, the borrowing rate margin and the unused line fee on the securitization were 0.80% and 0.40% per annum, respectively.
At December 31, 2016, net availability under the Facility was approximately $756.0 million.The following table presents the maximum and average daily borrowings outstanding under the Company’s short-term borrowing arrangements during the years ended December 31, (in millions): 2016 2015Short-term Borrowing ArrangementMaximum Average Maximum AverageCommercial paper$508.0 $236.6 $551.2 $336.7Receivables Facility and Securitization Facility859.4 529.7 400.0 332.5On January 26, 2016, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Term Loan Credit Agreement”) for a $1.5 billion senior unsecured term loan facility with a syndicate of banks.
In April 2016, the Company borrowed $1.5 billion pursuant to the Term Loan Credit Agreement, and the borrowings were used to pay a portion of the cash portion of the merger consideration in connection with the Jarden Acquisition.
The Term Loan Credit Agreement provides for a maturity date of three years from the closing date of the Jarden Acquisition and requires the Company to repay 5% of the initial borrowings by each of April 2017 and April 2018, 45% of the borrowings by October 2018 and the remaining 45% of the borrowings by April 2019.
At the Company’s election, borrowings under the Term Loan Credit Agreement bear interest either at (i) the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin, or (ii) the base rate plus an applicable margin.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company repaid $1.1 billion of the 44Table of Contentsborrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Credit Agreement.
The interest rate on the Term Loan Credit Agreement was approximately at 2.31% at December 31, 2016.In March 2016, the Company completed the offering and sale of the Notes for aggregate net proceeds of $7.9 billion, which were used to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration in the Jarden Acquisition and to repay certain outstanding debt of Jarden at closing.
The weighted average term of the Notes was 12.8 years, and the weighted-average interest rate, including amortization of issuance costs and the settled forward-starting interest rate swaps, was 4.38%.In March 2016, the Company commenced exchange offers (the “Exchange Offers”) pursuant to which the Company offered to issue new senior notes (the “Newell Notes”) in exchange for €300 million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 3.75% senior notes due October 2021 issued by Jarden and of the $300 million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 5.00% senior notes due November 2023 issued by Jarden (collectively, the “Existing Jarden Notes”).
The Exchange Offers expired and were settled in April 2016.
The aggregate principal amount of each series of Newell Notes issued in the Exchange Offers totaled €271.9 million of 3.75% senior notes due October 2021 and $295.1 million of 5.00% senior notes due November 2023.
Following the completion of the Exchange Offers and the Jarden Acquisition, a subsidiary of the Company assumed debt obligations associated with the Existing Jarden Notes (as modified) that were not tendered in the Exchange Offers, which included €28.1 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.75% senior notes due October 2021 and $4.9 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior notes due November 2023.
In October 2016, the Company completed a registered exchange offer to satisfy its obligations under a registration rights agreement, pursuant to which it offered to exchange the Newell Notes for registered notes having substantially identical terms.
All of the $295.1 million of 5.00% senior notes due November 2023 and €259.9 million of the €271.9 million of 3.75% senior notes due October 2021 participated in the registered exchange offer.The indentures governing the Company’s medium-term and long-term notes contain usual and customary nonfinancial covenants.
The Company’s borrowing arrangements other than the medium-term and long-term notes contain usual and customary nonfinancial covenants and certain financial covenants, including minimum interest coverage and maximum debt-to-total-capitalization ratios.
As defined by the agreements governing these other borrowing arrangements, minimum interest coverage ratio is computed as adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) divided by adjusted interest expense for the four most recent quarterly periods.
Generally, maximum debt-to-total-capitalization is calculated as the sum of short-term and long-term debt divided by the sum of (i) total debt, (ii) total stockholders’ equity, (iii) $750.0 million related to impairment charges incurred by the Company (amended under the Revolving Credit Agreement to add an additional $250.0 million of charges incurred after January 1, 2015) and (iv) up to $1.0 billion related to the component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for all foreign currency translation and the cumulative foreign exchange gains (losses) incurred since January 1, 2015 arising from (i) the appreciation or depreciation of the Venezuelan Bolivar relative to the U.S. Dollar due to the highly inflationary accounting for Venezuela and (ii) the cumulative gains or losses resulting from the deconsolidation of a foreign entity.
For purposes of calculating debt-to-total capitalization, the Company’s borrowing arrangements, as amended, provide for the exclusion of any debt incurred to finance the Jarden Acquisition from the calculation until after the closing of the Jarden Acquisition.
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had complied with all covenants under the indentures and its other borrowing arrangements, and the Company could access the full borrowing capacity available under the Facility and the Securitization Facility and utilize the $2.0 billion for general corporate purposes without exceeding the debt-to-total-capitalization limit in its financial covenants.
A failure to maintain the financial covenants would impair the Company’s ability to borrow under the Facility and the Securitization Facility and may result in the acceleration of the repayment of certain indebtedness.The following table presents the average outstanding debt and weighted-average interest rates for the years ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): 2016 2015 2014Average outstanding debt$10,692.0 $2,887.6 $2,085.2Average interest rate(1)3.7% 2.8% 3.0%(1)The average interest rate includes the impacts of fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps.
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 10.0% and 31.7%, respectively of the Company’s debt is considered variable-rate debt, by nature or through use of interest rate swaps.OutlookOverall, in the next twelve months, the Company believes that available cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated from future operations, access to capital markets, and availability under the Facility and the New Receivables Facility will be adequate to support the cash needs of Newell Brands.
The Company intends to use available cash, borrowing capacity, cash flows from future operations and alternative financing arrangements to invest in capital expenditures in support of the Company’s growth 45Table of Contentsplatforms, to maintain its dividend per share and to repay debt maturities as they come due, including short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt totaling $601.9 million as of December 31, 2016, which included the Company’s outstanding commercial paper obligations and borrowings under the Receivables Facility and Jarden Securitization Facility replaced by the New Receivables Facility.Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company has outstanding debt obligations maturing at various dates through 2046.
Certain other items, such as purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized as liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed.
Examples of items not recognized as liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of December 31, 2016, and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements.
The following table summarizes the effect that lease and other material contractual obligations is expected to have on the Company’s cash flow in the indicated period.
In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2016.
Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total20172018-20192020-20212022+Debt(1)$11,955.3$599.0$2,308.8$1,693.7$7,353.8Interest on debt(2)5,368.8479.9860.3733.73,294.9Operating lease obligations(3)1,025.3219.1340.2205.2260.8Purchase obligations(4)1,062.4852.2205.93.31.0Total contractual obligations(5)$19,411.8$2,150.2$3,715.2$2,635.9$10,910.5(1)Amounts represent contractual obligations based on the earliest date that the obligation may become due, excluding interest, based on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2016.

For further information relating to these obligations, see Footnote 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
(2)Amounts represent estimated interest payable on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2016, excluding the impact of fixed to floating rate interest rate swaps.
Interest on floating-rate debt was estimated using the rate in effect as of December 31, 2016.
For further information, see Footnote 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
(3)Amounts represent contractual minimum lease obligations on operating leases as of December 31, 2016.
For further information relating to these obligations, see Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
(4)Primarily consists of purchase commitments entered into as of December 31, 2016, for finished goods, raw materials, components and services pursuant to legally enforceable and binding obligations, which include all significant terms.
(5)Total does not include contractual obligations reported on the December 31, 2016 balance sheet as current liabilities, except for current portion of long-term debt, short-term debt and accrued interest.
The Company also has liabilities for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company is under audit from time-to-time by the IRS and other taxing authorities, and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming year.
While it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will be settled over time; therefore, the $367.9 million in unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2016 is excluded from the preceding table.
See Footnote 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Additionally, the Company has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement benefit plans, which are excluded from the preceding table.
The timing and amounts of the funding requirements are uncertain because they are dependent on interest rates and actual returns on plan assets, among other factors.
See Footnote 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $80.0 million in standby letters of credit primarily related to the Company’s self-insurance programs, including workers’ compensation, product liability and medical.
See Footnote 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.As of December 31, 2016, the Company did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe Company’s accounting policies are more fully described in Footnote 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
As disclosed in that footnote, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 46Table of Contentsrequires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes.
Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty.
Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment.
Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The following sections describe the Company’s critical accounting policies.
Sales Recognition Sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership transfer, which generally occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms.
Sales are net of provisions for cash discounts, returns, customer discounts (such as volume or trade discounts), cooperative advertising and other sales-related discounts.
Customer Programs The Company participates in various programs and arrangements with customers designed to increase the sale of products by these customers.
Among the programs negotiated are arrangements under which allowances are earned by customers for attaining agreed-upon sales levels or for participating in specific marketing programs.
Coupon programs are also developed on a customer- and territory-specific basis with the intent of increasing sales by all customers.
The cost of all of these various programs, included as a reduction in net sales, totaled $1,144.3 million, $659.3 million and $594.2 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Under customer programs and arrangements that require sales incentives to be paid in advance, the Company amortizes the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume.
When incentives are paid in arrears, the Company accrues the estimated amount to be paid based on the program’s contractual terms, expected customer performance and/or estimated sales volume.
These estimates are determined using historical customer experience and other factors, which sometimes require significant judgment.
Due to the length of time necessary to obtain relevant data from customers, among other factors, actual amounts paid can differ from these estimates.
Recovery of Accounts Receivable The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.
When aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position, the Company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes is collectible.
The Company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience.
Accounts are reviewed for potential write-off on a case-by-case basis.
Accounts deemed uncollectible are written off, net of expected recoveries.
If circumstances related to specific customers change, the Company’s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.
The Company’s reserve for uncollectible accounts was $23.3 million and $14.6 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Inventory Reserves The Company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow-moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
Net provisions for excess and obsolete inventories, including shrink reserves, totaled $33.0 million, $23.3 million and $24.2 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are included in cost of products sold.
The Company’s reserve for excess and obsolete inventory and shrink reserves totaled $45.9 million and $32.9 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.Business CombinationsThe Company allocates purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values.
The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.
Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from customer relationships, trade names and trademarks and acquired patents and developed technology; the period of time the Company expects to use the acquired intangible asset; and discount rates.
In estimating the future cash flows, the Company considers demand, competition and other economic factors.
The Company’s estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates, which could result in impairment charges in the future.
Estimates associated with the accounting for business combinations may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which could result in adjustments to the values of tangible 47Table of Contentsassets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired or could result in future income or expenses if such changes in estimates are identified beyond one year from the date of acquisition.The Company considers various factors in determining whether an acquired trademark or trade name has an indefinite life.
In assessing whether an acquired trademark or trade name has an indefinite life, the Company considers legal and regulatory provisions that may limit the useful life, customer loyalty, brand strength and positioning, the effects of obsolescence and other economic factors, the Company’s plans for incorporating the trademark or trade name into its brand portfolio and the Company’s historical experience in using and renewing similar assets.
The Company considers all other acquired intangible assets definite-lived assets and generally amortizes the assets on a straight-line basis.
The Company determines the amortizable life of acquired definite-lived intangible assets based on the number of years over which a significant amount of the discounted cash flows contributes to the estimated fair value of the asset.The Company accounts for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination.
A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred.
When estimating the costs of exiting facilities, estimates are made regarding future sublease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results.
As a result, the Company may be required to revise its estimates which may affect the Company’s results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made.Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible AssetsGoodwillThe Company performs its annual impairment testing of goodwill at a reporting unit level, and all of the Company’s goodwill is assigned to the Company’s reporting units.
Reporting units are generally one level below the operating segment level.
The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing as of July 1, 2016.
As of the impairment testing date, as a result of the Jarden Acquisition in April 2016, the Company’s reporting units significantly increased to 25 reporting units, comprising the Company’s expanded nine operating segments.
Acquired businesses, if any, including goodwill arising from such transactions, are typically integrated into the Company's existing reporting units; however, the 12 additional reporting units resulting from the Jarden Acquisition were not integrated into the Company’s existing reporting units.
Additionally, the Company recently announced changes to its management and division structure which will be executed in early 2017 and result in realigning the Company’s reporting units and operating segments next year.The Company had 25 reporting units with total goodwill of $10.2 billion of which approximately $8.3 billion related to goodwill acquired in the Jarden Acquisition.The Company conducts its annual test of impairment of goodwill as of the first day of the third quarter because it generally coincides with its annual strategic planning process.
The Company also tests for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount.
For example, if macroeconomic factors, such as consumer demand and consumer confidence, deteriorate materially such that the Company's reporting units’ projected sales and operating income decline significantly relative to previous estimates, the Company will perform an interim test to assess whether goodwill is impaired.
The Company determined that no interim tests of impairment of goodwill were necessary during 2016.
In the Company’s goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, impairment may be present.
Estimates made by management in performing its impairment testing may impact whether or not an impairment charge is necessary and the magnitude of the corresponding impairment charge to the extent one is recorded.
The Company uses multiple valuation approaches in its impairment testing, each of which requires estimates to arrive at an estimate of fair value.
For the Company's reporting units that are stable businesses and have a history of generating positive operating income and cash flows, the Company relies on a multiple of earnings approach to assess fair value.
The material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using this approach are the reporting units’ estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year and the applicable multiple to apply to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”).
The estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year is based on the Company’s internal forecasting process.
To determine the EBITDA multiple, the Company obtains information from third parties on EBITDA multiples observed for recent acquisitions and other transactions in the marketplace for comparable businesses.
The Company also evaluates the EBITDA multiples of publicly traded companies that are in the same industry and are comparable to each reporting unit and compares the EBITDA multiples of the publicly traded companies to the multiples used by the Company to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit.
The Company evaluates the EBITDA multiples used to value the reporting units relative to the Company's market capitalization plus an equity control premium.
The equity control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units’ estimated market values compared to the Company's market value, with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the market value of 48Table of Contentsthe Company.
The Company considers premiums paid by acquirers of comparable businesses to determine the reasonableness of the implied control premium.
The EBITDA multiple observed in the marketplace for publicly traded companies that are comparable to the reporting units ranged from 6 to 14.
In using the EBITDA multiples, the Company compared the aggregate value of all reporting units to the Company’s total market value to validate the aggregate values of the reporting units resulted in a reasonable implied equity control premium.
The Company considers several factors in estimating the EBITDA multiple applicable to each reporting unit, including the reporting unit’s market position, brand awareness, gross and operating income margins, and prospects for growth, among other factors.
After adjusting the EBITDA multiples for the reporting units, no potential goodwill impairment was indicated for reporting units for which this approach was used.
Furthermore, the Company's equity market value at July 1, 2016 of approximately $23.5 billion was significantly in excess of its book value of stockholders' equity of approximately $11.3 billion.
For the impairment test as of July 1, 2016, if each reporting unit’s EBITDA multiple were reduced by 0.5 from the 6 to 14 multiple used for each reporting unit, all reporting units where the EBITDA multiple approach was used to estimate the value of the reporting unit would have passed step one of the goodwill impairment test.
The Company relies on a discounted cash flow approach to value reporting units in certain circumstances, such as when the reporting unit is growing at a significantly slower rate than planned, is declining at a significantly faster rate than the overall market, has experienced significant losses, is in a stage of hyper-growth, is executing significant restructuring efforts, or is in a stage of development where it has not yet fully realized the benefits of scale and operating efficiencies.
The Company also relies on a discounted cash flow approach when a reporting unit is recently acquired.
As of July 1, 2016 and consistent with the aforementioned factors, the Company used the discounted cash flow approach for the annual impairment tests of its Elmer’s and Beverageware reporting units as well as the reporting units acquired in the Jarden Acquisition.
The material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow approach are the future financial performance and cash flows of the reporting unit, the discount rate, long-term sales growth rate, working capital reductions and working capital investments required.
Estimates of future financial performance include estimates of future sales growth rates, raw material and sourced product costs, currency fluctuations, and operating efficiencies to be realized.
The Company determines a discount rate based on an estimate of a reasonable risk-adjusted return an investor would expect to realize on an investment in the reporting unit.In using the discounted cash flow approach to value the Elmer’s reporting unit in 2016, the Company used average compound short-term and long-term sales growth rates of 3% and 2%, respectively, average operating margins generally ranging from 17% to 23%, and a discount rate of 10%.
The Company concluded the Elmer’s reporting unit passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test based on the estimated fair value determined using the discounted cash flow approach.
If the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the Elmer’s reporting unit increased 50 basis points, the Elmer’s reporting unit would still have passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test.
In using the discounted cash flow approach to value the Beverageware reporting unit in 2016, the Company used average compound short-term and long-term sales growth rates of 6% and 3%, respectively, average operating margins generally ranging from 10% to 16%, and a discount rate of 14%.
The Company concluded the Beverageware reporting unit passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test based on the estimated fair value determined using the discounted cash flow approach.
If the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the Beverageware reporting unit increased 50 basis points, the Beverageware reporting unit would still have passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test.
In using the discounted cash flow approach to value the reporting units from the Jarden Acquisition in 2016, the Company used discounted cash flow projections and related assumptions for sales growth, operating margins and discount rate that were consistent with the acquisition model.
The Company concluded the reporting units from the Jarden Acquisition passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment testing based on the estimated fair values determined using the discounted cash flow approach.
If the discount rates used to estimate the fair values of these reporting units were increased 50 basis points, these reporting units would not have passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test since the Jarden Acquisition took place in April 2016, and therefore fair values approximate carrying values.
For reporting units held for sale for which an offer has been received from a prospective buyer, the Company relies on the value offered by the third party for the sale of the reporting unit to estimate the reporting unit’s fair value.
In October 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the Tools business (excluding Dymo industrial labeling) for $1.95 billion, and such value was used as the estimated fair value of the Construction Tools & Accessories and Industrial Products & Services reporting units.
The estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value of the Construction Tools & Accessories and Industrial Products & Services reporting units, and the Company concluded the Construction Tools & Accessories and Industrial Products & Services reporting units reporting unit passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test.
Apart from the reporting units related to the Jarden Acquisition described above, the Company has no reporting units with net assets whose estimated fair values at July 1, 2016 exceeded net assets by less than 10% of the reporting unit’s net assets.
49Table of ContentsIndefinite-Lived Intangible AssetsThe Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test.
The Company may bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test.
Additionally, the Company may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.
In performing the qualitative assessment for each of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company considered events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, including factors such as declines in actual or planned sales or negative or declining cash flows; input cost inflation that may have a negative effect on future cash flows; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business or other factors; and, other entity-specific events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy or customers.
Based on the qualitative assessment, if the Company was unable to assert that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then the Company would proceed with the quantitative impairment test for such asset.
For the quantitative impairment test, the Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangible assets by employing a discounted cash flow model using the relief-from-royalty method, which estimates royalties to be derived in the future use of the asset were the Company to license the use of the trade name.
An impairment charge for indefinite-lived intangible assets is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date.
The Company completed its annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of July 1, 2016 and determined that none of its significant indefinite-lived intangible assets were impaired.
Prior to the Jarden Acquisition, there were $475.8 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets, and, as part of the Jarden Acquisition, the Company acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets with estimated fair values of $9.5 billion.
Although the purchase price is still preliminary, the Company does not expect these values to change significantly as they were derived from assumptions consistent with the acquisition model.
The Company performed the quantitative impairment test for the $37.0 million carrying value of the Aprica trade name due to competitive pressures and other factors that have recently adversely impacted Aprica sales in Japan.
The Company concluded the Aprica trade name was not impaired.
However, a 100 basis point decrease in the royalty rate used in the quantitative impairment test would have resulted in an impairment of the Aprica trade name of $10.4 million, and a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used would have resulted in an impairment of $4.9 million.
In addition, the Company performed a quantitative impairment test for the $200.0 million carrying value of the Elmer’s trade name due to the recent acquisition of the Elmer’s business.
The Company concluded the Elmer’s trade name was not impaired.
However, a 100 basis point decrease in the royalty rate used in the quantitative impairment test would have resulted in an impairment of the Elmer’s trade name of $16.4 million, and a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used would have resulted in an impairment of $18.0 million.
The Company also performed the quantitative impairment test for the $102.0 million carrying value of the Baby Jogger trade name due to the recent acquisition of the Baby Jogger business.
The Company concluded the Baby Jogger trade name was not impaired.
A 100 basis point decrease in the royalty rate used in the quantitative impairment test or a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used would not result in an impairment of the Baby Jogger trade name.
The Company considers qualitative and quantitative factors in determining whether impairment testing of the trademark and trade name assets is necessary at dates other than the annual impairment testing date, such as whether the Company has plans to abandon or significantly reduce the use of a trademark or trade name.
Based on consideration of these factors, the Company determined that no impairment indicators have been present, and therefore, impairment testing as of a date other than July 1, 2016 was not required during 2016.
Potential for Future ImpairmentsThe Company had 25 reporting units with total goodwill of $10.2 billion and $9.9 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2016.
The Company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets.
Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the Company’s customer base and net sales, a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers, or sustained declines in the Company’s market capitalization relative to its reported stockholders' equity.
The Company periodically evaluates the impact of economic and other conditions on the Company and its reporting units to assess whether impairment indicators are present.
The Company may be required to perform additional impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors, which could result in impairment charges in the future.
Although management cannot predict when improvements in macroeconomic conditions will occur, if consumer confidence and consumer spending decline significantly in the future or if commercial and industrial economic activity deteriorates significantly from current levels, it is reasonably likely the Company will be required to record impairment charges in the future.
Additionally, there are significant synergy savings projected for the Company as a result of the Jarden Acquisition.
50Table of ContentsIf these synergy savings are not realized, or are realized by reporting units which differ significantly from the estimated projections, it is reasonably likely that the Company would be required to record impairment charges in the future.Capitalized Software Costs The Company capitalizes costs associated with internal-use software during the application development stage after both the preliminary project stage has been completed and the Company’s management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development.
Capitalized internal-use software costs include: (i) external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software; (ii) payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project; and (iii) interest costs incurred while developing the software.
Capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose.
The Company expenses as incurred research and development, general and administrative, and indirect costs associated with internal-use software.
In addition, the Company expenses as incurred training, maintenance and other internal-use software costs incurred during the post-implementation stage.
Costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of internal-use software are capitalized only if such modifications result in additional functionality of the software.
The Company capitalized $37.0 million of internal-use software costs during 2016, which primarily relate to employee, consultant and related personnel costs incurred in the rollout of SAP in Asia Pacific.
Capitalized software costs net of accumulated amortization were $229.1 million at December 31, 2016, which excludes $44.6 million of capitalized internal-use software classified as assets held for sale.
Capitalized interest costs included in capitalized software were not material as of December 31, 2016.The Company amortizes internal-use software costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which typically ranges from 3 to 12 years.
Capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of impairment, including but not limited to a significant change in available technology or the manner in which the software is being used.
Impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values.
Other Long-Lived Assets The Company continuously evaluates whether impairment indicators related to its property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are present.
These impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition, or a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group.
If impairment indicators are present, the Company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets.
The sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount.
The cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future sales and expenses, working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the Company’s forecasts.
If the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, the Company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group.
Generally, the Company performs its testing of the asset group at the product-line level, as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available.
Product Liability Reserves The Company has a self-insurance program for product liability that includes reserves for self-retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance.
The Company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods, review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves.
The Company’s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the Company’s product liability reserve.
The Company has product liability reserves of $81.7 million as of December 31, 2016.
While the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims, the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the Company, and such additional losses may be material to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
Legal and Environmental Reserves The Company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, as well as contract and other disputes.
The Company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and estimates the probability and amount of loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows for certain environmental matters.
The estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated.
No insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the Company’s cost estimates or reserve, nor do the Company’s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes, except with respect to long-term operations and maintenance, Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and other matters which are estimated 51Table of Contentsat present value.
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had a reserve of $41.9 million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate, which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Income Taxes In accordance with relevant authoritative guidance, the Company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach.
Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by current enacted tax rates.
Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.
No provision is made for the U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, as substantially all such earnings are permanently reinvested.
The Company’s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the IRS and other tax authorities.
Although the Company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, it has established tax, interest and penalty reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken, which could result in additional liabilities for taxes, interest and penalties.
The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies.
For uncertain tax positions, the Company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance, which requires application of a “more likely than not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions.
The Company’s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the Company’s effective tax rate as well as impact operating results.
The Company’s provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be favorably or adversely affected by earnings being higher or lower in countries that have lower tax rates and higher or lower in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities; by expiration of or lapses in tax-related legislation; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by changes in accounting principles; by liquidity needs driving repatriations of non-U.S. cash to the U.S.; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, including possible U.S. changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules.
The Company’s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign tax rates, tax credits, the domestic manufacturing deduction, tax audit settlements and valuation allowance adjustments.
Significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions, determining valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets, and ultimately, the income tax provision.
It is difficult to predict when resolution of income tax matters will occur and when recognition of certain income tax assets and liabilities is appropriate, and the Company’s income tax expense in the future may continue to differ from the statutory rate because of the effects of similar items.
For example, if items are favorably resolved or management determines a deferred tax asset is realizable that was previously reserved, the Company will recognize period tax benefits.
Conversely, to the extent tax matters are unfavorably resolved or management determines a valuation allowance is necessary for a tax asset that was not previously reserved, the Company will recognize incremental period tax expense.
These matters are expected to contribute to the tax rate differing from the statutory rate and continued volatility in the Company’s effective tax rate.
See Footnote 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Pensions and Postretirement Benefits The Company records annual amounts relating to its pension and postretirement plans based on calculations, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates.
The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so.
The effect of modifications is generally deferred and amortized over future periods.
The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience, market conditions and the input from its actuaries and investment advisors.
The pension and postretirement obligations are measured as of December 31 for 2016 and 2015.The Company employs a total return investment approach for its pension and postretirement benefit plans whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of pension and postretirement plan assets.
The intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by outperforming plan liabilities over the long run.
Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition.
The investment portfolios contain a diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments.
Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across 52Table of Contentsgeography and market capitalization through investments in U.S. large-capitalization stocks, U.S. small-capitalization stocks and international securities.
Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.The expected long-term rate of return for plan assets is based upon many factors including expected asset allocations, historical asset returns, current and expected future market conditions, risk and active management premiums.
The target asset allocations for the Company’s domestic pension plans may vary by plan, based in part due to plan demographics, funded status and liability duration.
In general, the Company’s target asset allocations for the domestic pension plans are as follows: equities approximately 25% to 40%; bonds approximately 20% to 40%; and cash, alternative investments and other, approximately 25% to 45%.
Actual asset allocations may vary from the targeted allocations for various reasons, including market conditions and the timing of transactions.
The Company maintains numerous international defined benefit pension plans.
The asset allocations for the international investment may vary by plan and jurisdiction and are primarily based upon the plan structure and plan participant profile.
At December 31, 2016, the domestic plan assets were allocated as follows: Equities: approximately 37.0% and Other Investments (alternative investments, fixed-income securities, cash and other): approximately 63.0%.For 2016, 2015 and 2014, the actual return (loss) on plan assets for the Company’s U.S. pension plan assets was approximately $71.0 million, $(14.0) million and $74.0 million, respectively, versus an expected return on plan assets of approximately $69.0 million, $58.0 million and $58.0 million, respectively.
The actual amount of future contributions will depend, in part, on long-term actual return on assets and future discount rates.
Pension contributions for all of the Company’s pension plans for 2017 are estimated to be approximately $27.0 million, compared to approximately $28.0 million in 2016.The weighted average expected return on plan assets assumption for 2016 was approximately 5.5% for the Company’s pension plans.
The weighted average discount rate at the 2016 measurement date used to measure the pension and postretirement benefit obligations was approximately 3.5%.
A 25 basis points decrease in the discount rate at the 2016 measurement date would increase the pension plans’ projected benefit obligation by approximately $71.0 million.The healthcare cost trend rates used in valuing the Company’s postretirement benefit obligation are established based upon actual healthcare cost trends and consultation with actuaries and benefit providers.
At the 2016 measurement date, the current weighted average healthcare cost trend rate assumption was approximately 8.7%.
The current healthcare cost trend rate gradually decreases to an ultimate healthcare cost trend rate of 4.5%.
A one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would not have a material effect on the postretirement benefit obligation or the service and interest cost components of postretirement benefit costs.See Footnote 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans.
Restructuring The Company has and expects to continue to engage in restructuring activities, which requires management to utilize significant estimates related to the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reductions and other separation programs, realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete, lease cancellation costs, sublease income and other exit costs, including environmental and legal contingencies associated with restructuring activities.
The Company accrues for severance and other employee separation costs under these activities when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable.
The rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans, historical experience and previously negotiated settlements.
The Company accrues for future lease costs, net of management’s estimate for future sublease income, when the leased property has been vacated and is no longer being used.
When estimating the costs of exiting facilities, estimates are made regarding future sublease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results and result in additional restructuring costs in future periods.
Environmental and legal contingencies associated with restructuring activities are accrued when the liability is probable of being incurred and is estimable.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMarket RiskIn general, business enterprises can be exposed to market risks including fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices, and that can affect the cost of operating, investing and financing under those conditions.
The Company believes it has moderate exposure to these risks.
The Company assesses market risk based on changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates and commodity prices utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential loss in earnings, fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical 10% change in these rates and prices.The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its variable rate debt and price risk on its fixed rate debt.
As such, the Company monitors the interest rate environment and uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk and price risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable interest rates while attempting to minimize interest costs.
As of December 31, 2016, approximately $1.2 billion of the Company’s debt carries a variable rate of interest either by nature or through the use of interest rate swaps.
The remainder of the debt (approximately $10.7 billion) carries a fixed rate of interest.
Based upon the Company’s debt structure at December 31, 2016, a hypothetical 1% increase in these interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately $11.8 million and decrease the fair values of debt by approximately $711.2 million.
54Table of ContentsWhile the Company transacts business predominantly in U.S. dollars and most of its revenues are collected in U.S. dollars, a substantial portion of the Company’s operating costs are denominated in other currencies, such as the Brazilian Real, British Pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese Renminbi, European Euro, Japanese Yen and Mexican Peso.
Changes in the relation of these and other currencies to the U.S. dollar will affect Company’s sales and profitability and could result in exchange losses.
For 2016, approximately 28% of the Company’s sales were denominated in foreign currencies, the most significant of which were: European Euro-approximately 9.0%; and Canadian dollar-approximately 5.4%.
The primary purpose of the Company’s foreign currency hedging activities is to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate exposure on the cash flows related to forecasted inventory purchases and sales.
A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on foreign currency gains and losses related to the foreign currency derivatives or the net fair value of the Company’s foreign currency derivatives.The Company is exposed to the price risk that the rising cost of commodities has on certain of its raw materials.
As such, the Company monitors the commodities markets and from time to time the Company enters into commodity-based derivatives in order to mitigate the impact that the rising price of these commodities has on the cost of certain of the Company’s raw materials.
A hypothetical 10% change in the commodity prices underlying the derivatives would not have a material effect on the related gains and losses included in the Company’s results of operations.
In this sensitivity analysis, all other assumptions are constant and assumes that a change in one currency’s rate relative to the U.S. dollar would not impact another currency’s rates relative to the U.S. dollar.The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to its derivative financial instruments, all of which are highly rated institutions; however, the Company does not anticipate non-performance by such counterparties.The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
