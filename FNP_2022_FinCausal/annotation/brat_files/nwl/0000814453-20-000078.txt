This section should be read along with the relevant portions of this 2019 Annual Report for a complete discussion of the events and items summarized below.OverviewNewell Brands is a global marketer of consumer and commercial products that make life better every day, where they live, learn, work and play.
Our products are marketed under a strong portfolio of leading brands, including Paper Mate®, Sharpie®, Dymo®, EXPO®, Parker®, Elmer’s®, Coleman®, Marmot®, Oster®, Sunbeam®, FoodSaver®, Mr. Coffee®, Rubbermaid Commercial Products®, Graco®, Baby Jogger®, NUK®, Calphalon®, Rubbermaid®, Contigo®, First Alert®, Mapa®, Spontex®, Quickie® and Yankee Candle®.
The Company sells its products in nearly 200 countries around the world and has operations on the ground in nearly 100 of these countries.Business StrategyThe Company is currently executing a turnaround strategy, with the vision of building a global, next generation consumer products company that can unleash the full potential of its brands in a fast moving omni-channel environment.
These strategies are designed to address key challenges facing the Company, including: shifting consumer preferences and behaviors; a highly competitive operating environment; a rapidly changing retail landscape, including the growth in e-commerce; continued macroeconomic and political volatility; and an evolving regulatory landscape.The Company has identified the following strategic imperatives to address and adapt to these challenges during its turnaround period:•Strengthen the portfolio by investing in attractive categories aligned with its capabilities and strategy;•Sustainable profitable growth by focusing on innovation, as well as growth in digital marketing, e-commerce and its international businesses;•Attractive margins by driving productivity and overhead savings to reinvest into the business;•Cash efficiency by improving key working capital metrics, resulting in a lower cash conversion cycle; and•Build a winning team through engagement and focusing the best people on the right things.Execution on these strategic imperatives will better position the Company for long-term sustainable growth in order to achieve its short-to-near-term goals of: •Growing core sales;•Improving operating margins;•Accelerating cash conversion cycle; and•Strengthening organizational capability and employee engagement.Accelerated Transformation PlanOn December 31, 2019, the Company completed the sale of its Playing Cards business to Cartamundi Inc. and Cartamundi España S.L.
for approximately $220 million, subject to adjustment for working capital and other items, and recorded a pre-tax loss of $5.0 million, which completed its previously announced ATP, which was designed to accelerate value creation and more rapidly transform the portfolio to one best positioned to leverage the Company’s advantaged capabilities in innovation, design and e-commerce.
The ATP was also designed to significantly increase shareholder value through both meaningful returns of capital to shareholders and strengthened operational and financial performance, while simultaneously deleveraging the balance sheet.
In connection with the ATP, the Company completed the sale of several businesses during 2018 and 2019.
In 2018, the Company sold: Goody, Jostens, Pure Fishing, Rawlings, Waddington and other related subsidiaries.
In 2019, the Company sold: its Process Solutions business, Rexair, The United States Playing Card Company and other related subsidiaries.
As a result of these transactions, 26Table of Contentsthe Company recorded aggregate pre-tax gains of $7.3 million and $831 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and received gross proceeds of $996 million and $5.1 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
At December 31, 2019, the Company’s total debt was $5.7 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $349 million.
In July 2019, the Company announced its decision to no longer pursue the sale of the majority of Commercial Products.
The decision to keep Commercial Products was based on the strength of the brand, its competitive position in a large and growing category, and track record of cash flow generation, revenue growth and margin expansion.
Management believes that retaining this business will further enhance the value creation opportunity for the Company.
In October 2019, the Company decided to no longer pursue the sale of the Mapa/Spontex and Quickie businesses.
The decision to keep these businesses was based on their financial profile, relative to expected sales proceeds.
At December 31, 2019, the Commercial Business is no longer classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Financial Statements and is reported in the Food and Commercial segment (see below) for all periods presented.
During 2019, the Company recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment of depreciation and amortization expense of $56.6 million to reflect the amounts that would have been recorded had these businesses been continuously classified as held and used.See Footnote 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Organizational StructureThe Company’s four primary operating segments are as follows:Segment Key Brands Description of Primary ProductsAppliances and Cookware Calphalon®, Crock-Pot®, Mr. Coffee®, Oster® and Sunbeam® Household products, including kitchen appliances, gourmet cookware, bakeware and cutleryFood and Commercial Ball®, FoodSaver®, Rubbermaid®, Sistema®, Rubbermaid Commercial Products®, Mapa®, Quickie® and Spontex® Food storage and home storage products, fresh preserving products, vacuum sealing products, commercial cleaning and maintenance solutions, hygiene systems and material handling solutionsHome and Outdoor Living Chesapeake Bay Candle®, Coleman®, Contigo®, ExOfficio®, First Alert®, Marmot®, WoodWick® and Yankee Candle® Products for outdoor and outdoor-related activities, home fragrance products and connected home and securityLearning and Development Aprica®, Baby Jogger®, Dymo®, Elmer’s®, EXPO®, Graco®, Mr. Sketch®, NUK®, Paper Mate®, Parker®, Prismacolor®, Sharpie®, Tigex® Waterman® and X-Acto® Writing instruments, including markers and highlighters, pens and pencils; art products; activity-based adhesive and cutting products; labeling solutions; baby gear and infant care productsThis new structure reflects the manner in which the chief operating decision maker regularly assesses information for decision-making purposes, including the allocation of resources.
The Company also provides general corporate services to its segments which is reported as a non-operating segment, Corporate.
All prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this reporting structure.
See Footnote 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Recent DevelopmentsAnnual Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset ImpairmentsDuring the third quarter, management historically performs its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing.
During the second quarter of 2019, the Company changed the date of its annual impairment test from July 1 to December 1.
The change was made to more closely align the impairment test date with the Company’s annual planning and budgeting process, as well as its long-term planning and forecasting process.
Pursuant to the authoritative accounting literature, in 2019 the Company was required to perform an annual impairment test as of the first day of its third quarter of 2019 (July 1) and also on December 1 to ensure that the change in impairment testing date would not delay or avoid an impairment charge.
There were no goodwill impairment charges as a result of the Company's 2019 annual goodwill impairment testing performed in the third quarter at July 1, 2019, or in the fourth quarter, at December 1, 2019.27Table of ContentsDuring the third quarter impairment testing, the Company recorded impairment charges of $607 million within the Appliances and Cookware segment.
The carrying value of certain Appliances and Cookware tradenames exceeded their fair value primarily due to the recently announced tariffs on Chinese imports at the time of the third quarter impairment testing, as well as a decline in sales volume due to a loss in market share for certain appliance categories from newly launched competitive products.
Both of these factors resulted in downward revisions to forecasted results.
In addition, in the Home and Outdoor Living segment, impairment charges of $151 million and $65.8 million were recorded within the Home Fragrance and Outdoor and Recreation reporting units, respectively.
The carrying value of certain Home and Outdoor Living tradenames exceeded their fair value primarily within the Home Fragrance reporting unit.
The reporting unit has begun to experience a shift in product mix that is expected to continue into the future, which resulted in a downward revision to forecasted results for one of its tradenames.During the fourth quarter of 2019 impairment testing, the Company recorded impairment charges of $52.4 million within the Home and Outdoor Living segment.
The carrying value of certain tradenames in the Outdoor and Recreation reporting unit exceeded their fair value primarily due to downward revisions to forecasted results subsequent to the third quarter impairment testing.
In addition, in the Learning and Development segment, impairment charges of $24.2 million were recorded as the carrying value of a tradename in the Writing reporting unit exceeded its fair value primarily due to a faster than anticipated deterioration in sales for slime-related adhesive products, which resulted in a downward revision to forecasted results for one of its tradenames.
In addition to the charges recorded as a result of the annual impairment testing in 2019, the Company recorded in continuing operations approximately $311 million of additional impairment charges, which reflect the decreases in carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for Mapa and Quickie while these businesses were classified as held for sale.
In 2019, the Company also recorded an impairment charge of approximately $11.5 million in continuing operations in connection with an overstatement of the Company's state income tax receivable, partially offset by a $8.8 million benefit in continuing operations related to change in uncertain tax position.
Additional impairment charges of $112 million were recorded in discontinued operations for businesses divested in 2019.See “Critical Accounting Estimates,” Footnote 1 and Footnote 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Tender Offer and Debt RedemptionsIn November 2019, the Company redeemed the entire $300 million aggregate principal of its 5.00% senior notes due 2023 for total consideration, excluding accrued interest, of approximately $308 million.
In August 2019, the Company commenced cash tender offers (the “Tender Offers”) totaling approximately $700 million for up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of certain series of its senior notes.
In August 2019, pursuant to the Tender Offers, the Company repurchased approximately $357 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.85% senior notes due 2023, $299 million of its 4.00% senior notes due 2024 and $44 million of its 3.90% senior notes due 2025 for total consideration, excluding accrued interest, of approximately $728 million.
As a result of the aforementioned debt extinguishments, the Company recorded losses on the extinguishment of debt of $28.3 million during 2019.See Footnote 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Jarden Acquisition - Dissenting Shareholders SettlementOn July 19, 2019, the Court issued an order in the appraisal rights proceeding brought by certain former Jarden Corporation shareholders.
The Court determined that the fair value of the remaining Jarden shares to be paid to the remaining dissenting shareholders as of the date of the Merger was $48.31 per share and ordered the payment of accrued interest, compounded quarterly, and accruing from the date of closing to the date of payment.
On October 4, 2019, the Company paid the judgment in the amount of approximately $177 million, which cut off interest accumulation on the judgment amount.
The dissenting shareholders have appealed the judgment.
The Company reflected $171 million and $6 million as a financing cash outflow and operating cash outflow, respectively, within the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2019.See Footnote 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Impact of TariffsThe United States Trade Representative (“USTR”) has imposed increased tariffs on some Chinese goods imported into the United States, resulting in increased costs for the Company.
The Company has been successful at securing from the USTR exemptions and exclusions for some of our products, with the most notable exemptions being for our baby gear, which represents a substantial 28Table of Contentsportion of the Company’s tariff exposure.
The Company’s gross tariff exposure from the existing tariffs on Chinese goods was approximately $70 million for 2019.
The Company has largely mitigated its tariff exposure, in part through pricing, productivity and, in some cases, relocation.
The Phase 1 agreement signed on January 15, 2020 with China reduced tariffs under List 4a from 15% to 7.5% (effective February 14, 2020) and suspended tariffs under List 4b at 15%, which was due to go into effect on December 15, 2019.
The terms of the agreement significantly reduced the estimated impact on tariffs for 2020.
In spite of the agreement, a full year of previously implemented tariffs, could have a material impact on the Company's operating results and cash flows, with an estimated gross impact of approximately $90 million in 2020, primarily relating to our Appliances and Cookware, Consumer and Commercial, and Outdoor and Recreation businesses.
The Company will continue to monitor the trade negotiations and deploy mitigation efforts to offset the gross exposure.
However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its mitigation efforts.New Treasury Regulations On June 18, 2019, the U.S. Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released temporary regulations under Section 245A as enacted by the 2017 Tax Reform and the Temporary Regulations to apply retroactively to the date the 2017 Tax Reform was enacted.
The Temporary Regulations seek to limit the 100% dividends received deduction permitted by Section 245A for certain dividends received from controlled foreign corporations and to limit the applicability of the look-through exception to foreign personal holding company income for certain dividends received from controlled foreign corporations.
Before the retroactive application of the Temporary Regulations, the Company benefited in 2018 from both the 100% dividends received deduction and the look-through exception to foreign personal holding company income.
The Company has analyzed the Temporary Regulations and concluded that the relevant Temporary Regulations were not validly issued.
Therefore, the Company has not accounted for the effects of the Temporary Regulations in its Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ending December 31, 2019.
The Company believes it has strong arguments in favor of its position and believes it has met the more likely than not recognition threshold that its position will be sustained.
However, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in challenging the validity of regulations, as well as a potential litigation process, there can be no assurances that the relevant Temporary Regulations will be invalidated or that a court of law will rule in favor of the Company.
If the Company’s position on the Temporary Regulations is not sustained, the Company would be required to recognize an income tax expense of approximately $180 million to $220 million related to an income tax benefit from the 2018 year that was recorded based on regulations in existence at the time.
In addition, the Company may be required to pay any applicable interest and penalties.
The Company intends to vigorously defend its position.CoronavirusThe Company’s global operations expose it to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, which could harm its business and cause operational results to suffer.
In December 2019 and January 2020, an outbreak of a new strain of Coronavirus in Wuhan, China, has resulted in travel disruption and an impact on corporate operations in China.
At this point, the exact extent to which the Coronavirus may impact the Company’s supply chain or results of operations is uncertain, however revenues may be impacted in the first half of 2020.29Table of ContentsResults of OperationsConsolidated Operating Results 2019 vs. 2018 Years Ended December 31,(in millions, except per share data) 2019 2018 $ Change % ChangeNet sales $9,714.9 $10,154.0 $(439.1) (4.3)%Gross profit 3,219.4 3,517.7 (298.3) (8.5)%Gross margin 33.1 % 34.6 %

NM — Not meaningfulNet sales for 2019 decreased 4%, with declines across all segments, primarily within the Appliances and Cookware, Food and Commercial and Home and Outdoor Living segments.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted net sales by $164 million, or 2%.Gross profit for 2019 decreased 8% and gross profit margin declined to 33.1% in 2019 as compared with 34.6% in 2018.
This performance was primarily due to lower net sales, product mix, inflation related to input costs and tariffs.
Gross profit and margin in 2019 were also unfavorably impacted by a cumulative catch-up adjustment for depreciation expense of $47.9 million related to the Company’s decision to retain the Commercial Business.
Approximately $27 million of this depreciation expense related to the amounts that would have been recorded in the prior year had the Commercial Business been continuously classified as held and used.
See Footnote 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
In addition, gross profit and margin in 2019 were unfavorably impacted by approximately $19.8 million of costs associated with a product recall in the Home and Outdoor Living segment.
See Footnote 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
The gross profit decrease was partially offset by productivity improvement in the current year from various initiatives.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted gross profit by $56.3 million, or 2%.Notable items impacting operating loss for 2019 and 2018 are as follows: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2019 2018 $ ChangeImpairment of goodwill and other intangible assets (See Footnote 8) $1,212.7 $8,296.0 $(7,083.3)Restructuring (See Footnote 5) and restructuring-related costs (1) 81.2 97.9 (16.7)Held for sale depreciation and amortization catch-up adjustment (See Footnotes 7 and 8) (2) 56.6 — 56.6Product recall costs (See Footnote 19) 19.8 — 19.8Bad debt write off for large customer — 25.5 (25.5)(1)Restructuring-related costs reported in cost of products sold and selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) for 2019 were $15.9 million and $38.2 million, respectively, and primarily relate to accelerated depreciation associated with restructuring activities.
Restructuring-related costs of $11.1 million for 2018 were reported in selling, general and administrative expenses.
Restructuring costs for 2019 and 2018 were $27.1 million and $86.8 million, respectively, and primarily represent costs associated with the ATP, which was completed at the end of 2019.30Table of Contents(2)Amounts reported in cost of products sold and SG&A for 2019 were $47.9 million and $8.7 million, respectively.Operating loss decreased to $482 million in 2019 as compared to $7.6 billion in 2018.
Operating loss included non-cash impairment charges of goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets of $8.3 billion recorded in 2018 as compared to $1.2 billion of non-cash impairment charges of goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in 2019.
This performance also included overhead reduction driven by various initiatives, lower restructuring and restructuring-related charges in the current year primarily related to the now completed ATP, and the lapping of a bad debt write off of $25.5 million from a large customer in the prior year.
These decreases in operating loss and operating margin were partially offset by the cumulative catch-up adjustment for depreciation and amortization expense of $56.6 million recorded in 2019 as a result of the Company’s decision to retain the Commercial Business.
Approximately $32.5 million of this depreciation and amortization expense in 2019 related to the amounts that would have been recorded in the prior year had the Commercial Business been continuously classified as held and used.
In addition, operating loss and operating margin in 2019 were unfavorably impacted by $19.8 million of costs associated with a product recall in the Home and Outdoor Living segment.
Interest expense, net for 2019 decreased primarily due to lower debt levels.
The weighted average interest rate for 2019 and 2018 was approximately 4.4% and 4.2%, respectively.The loss on the extinguishment of debt of $28.3 million and $4.1 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively, are related to the Company’s tender offer of certain of its senior notes and debt redemptions.
See Footnote 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Other expense (income), net for 2019 and 2018 include the following items: Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018Foreign exchange (gains) losses, net (See Footnote 1) $12.8 $7.8Fair value equity adjustments (See Footnote 1 and Footnote 17) 20.6 1.0Pension-related non-service costs, net (See Footnote 13) 0.2 (6.2)Gain on legacy Jarden investment — (11.3)(Gain) loss on disposition of businesses, net 0.2 (1.9)Other, net 4.5 (2.0) $38.3 $(12.6)Income tax benefit for 2019 was $1.0 billion as compared to $1.4 billion in 2018.
The effective tax rate for 2019 was 122% as compared to 17% in 2018.
The income tax benefit for 2019 primarily relates to a benefit of $522 million related to the deferred tax effects associated with the internal realignment of certain intellectual property rights, a benefit of $227 million associated with a taxable loss related to the impairment of certain assets and the pre-tax net loss for the year.
See Footnote 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information.
The income tax benefit for 2018 primarily relates to the pre-tax net loss for the year, partially offset by the impact of goodwill impairment charges which were not tax effected.Business Segment Operating Results 2019 vs. 2018Appliances and Cookware Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 $ Change % ChangeNet sales $1,691.0 $1,818.6 $(127.6) (7.0)%

Operating income and operating margins improved primarily due to lower non-cash impairment charges of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets of $24.8 million recorded in 2019 as compared to $351 million of non-cash impairment charges of goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in 2018.
The increase in operating income also included overhead reduction driven by various initiatives in the current year and the lapping of a bad debt write off from a large customer in the prior year, partially offset by higher advertising and promotion costs in the current year and net insurance recoveries from a fire-related loss in the prior year.33Table of ContentsConsolidated Operating Results 2018 vs. 2017 Years Ended December 31,(in millions, except per share data) 2018 2017 $ Change % ChangeNet sales $10,154.0 $11,170.4 $(1,016.4) (9.1)%Gross profit 3,517.7 3,810.5 (292.8) (7.7)%Gross margin 34.6 % 34.1 %

NM — Not meaningfulNet sales for 2018 decreased 9%, with declines across all segments.
The net sales decline also included the impact of 2017 divestitures and the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standards, both of which unfavorably impacted net sales by 2%.
See Footnote 1 and Footnote 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on 2017 divestitures and adoption of the new revenue recognition standards, respectively.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted net sales by $18.2 million.Gross profit for 2018 decreased 8%, primarily driven by the impact of 2017 divestitures and lower sales, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions.
Reported gross margin was 34.6% versus 34.1% as the benefit from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standards, pricing, product mix, synergies and cost savings was mostly offset by the impact of inflation related to cost of goods, freight and tariffs.
See Footnote 1, Footnote 2 and Footnote 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on 2017 divestitures and acquisitions, and adoption of the new revenue recognition standards, respectively.Notable items impacting operating loss for 2018 and 2017 are as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 $ ChangeImpairment of goodwill and other intangible assets (See Footnote 8) $8,296.0 $63.6 $8,232.4Operating loss was $7.6 billion in 2018 as compared to operating income of $707 million in 2017.
Operating loss for 2018 included non-cash impairment charges of goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets of $8.3 billion.
This performance also relates to the negative impact of lower sales, partially offset by synergies and cost savings, lower integration and acquisition-related costs and decreased restructuring costs.Interest expense, net for 2018 decreased primarily due to lower debt levels.
The weighted average interest rate for 2018 and 2017 was approximately 4.2% and 4.0%, respectively.The loss on the extinguishment of debt of $4.1 million and $32.3 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, are related to the Company’s tender offer of certain of its senior notes and debt redemptions.

The decrease also included a bad debt write off from a large customer in 2018, partially offset by net insurance recoveries from a fire-related loss, a decrease in SG&A and productivity savings.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAt December 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $349 million, of which approximately $331 million was held by the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries.
Overall, the Company believes that available cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated from future operations, access to capital markets, and availability under its Facility (defined hereafter) and Securitization Facility (defined hereafter) will be adequate to support the cash needs of the Company.
The Company intends to use available cash, borrowing capacity, cash flows from future operations, divestiture proceeds and alternative financing arrangements to invest in capital expenditures in support of the Company’s growth platforms, to maintain its dividend per share, to pay down debt and debt maturities as they come due and to complete its ongoing restructuring initiatives.
In addition, the Company had restricted cash of $22.3 million at December 31, 2019.37Table of ContentsCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash changed as follows for 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in millions): Increase (Decrease)Continuing Operations2019 2018 2017 20192018Cash provided by operating activities$1,090.1 $557.3 $857.4 $532.8$(300.1)Cash provided by (used in) investing activities(243.0) (207.8) 1,193.6 (35.2)(1,401.4)Cash used in financing activities(971.3) (321.1) (2,194.8) (650.2)1,873.7Discontinued Operations

Moody’s continues to maintain its investment grade debt rating for the Company.
At December 31, 2019, the Company could borrow up to approximately $800 million under its commercial paper program.
As a result of the downgrade, the Company’s ability to borrow under its commercial paper program will be adversely affected for a period of time either through an increase in interest costs on borrowings under the commercial paper program or limitations on or elimination of the Company’s ability to access the commercial paper market.
The Company does not expect any overall change in its ability to access liquidity in the short term as a result of the downgrade.
At December 31, 2019, the Company had $25.0 million outstanding under our commercial paper program.Limitations on access to the commercial paper program may require the Company to borrow additional funds under the Facility.
The Company’s ability to borrow under the Facility will not be affected by the downgrade.
The interest rate for borrowings under the Facility would be one-month LIBOR plus 105 basis points.
The Company's Facility requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants.
A failure to maintain the financial covenants would impair the Company's ability to borrow under the Facility.
At the time of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company is compliant with its financial covenants.
See Footnote 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Facility.In addition, certain of the Company’s Senior Notes aggregating to approximately $4.5 billion in principal amount outstanding are subject to an interest rate adjustment of 25 basis points as a result of the downgrade.
This increase to the interest rates of the Senior Notes subject to adjustment is expected to increase the Company’s annualized interest expense by approximately $11 million.Furthermore, the Company may be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings, and its potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease as a result of the downgrade.Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesThe change in operating activities from continuing operations for 2019 is primarily due to favorable working capital management as a result of the Company’s continued focus on improving its working capital.
There was a decrease in accounts receivable due to better terms compliance as a result of improvements in the Company’s dispute resolution process and accounts receivable sold under the new Customer Receivables Purchase Agreement (see “Capital Resources”).
Operating cash flow also benefited from a decrease in cash paid for interest and income taxes of approximately $153 million and $136 million, respectively.
38Table of ContentsThe change in operating activities from continuing operations for 2018 is in part due to an increase in cash taxes paid (approximately $135 million) related to the gain on the sale of the Tools business, lower payables in 2018 and favorable working capital benefits in 2017 related to the divested businesses, partially offset by strong inventory management and other working capital initiatives and timing, as well as lower bonus and incentive payments.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesThe change in investing activities from continuing operations for 2019 was primarily due to cash received by the Company in the prior year for insurance claims, which include a claim from fire-related losses and settlement of a note receivable related to a legacy Jarden investment.
For 2019 and 2018, capital expenditures from continuing operations were $248 million and $263 million, respectively.The change in investing activities from continuing operations for 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in the proceeds from the sale of businesses (approximately $2.1 billion), partially offset by a decrease in cash used for the acquisition of businesses (approximately $634 million).
For 2018 and 2017, capital expenditures from continuing operations were $263 million and $292 million, respectively.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesThe change in financing activities for 2019 was primarily due to the year-over-year change in debt (approximately $2.2 billion) and a decrease in shares repurchased (approximately $1.5 billion), partially offset by payments to dissenting shareholders in 2019 (approximately $171 million) in connection with the Jarden acquisition.
See Footnote 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the dissenting shareholders settlement from the Jarden acquisition.The change in financing activities for 2018 was primarily due to the period-over-period decrease in borrowings on short-term debt (approximately $1.0 billion), an increase in shares repurchased (approximately $1.4 billion), and an increase in the payments on long-term debt (approximately $1.1 billion), partially offset by payments to dissenting shareholders in 2017 (approximately $162 million) in connection with the Jarden acquisition.Capital ResourcesThe Company maintains a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility that matures in December 2023 (the “Facility”).
Under the Facility, the Company may borrow funds on a variety of interest rate terms.
Since the Facility provides the committed backup liquidity required to issue commercial paper, the Company may issue commercial paper up to a maximum of $800 million provided there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the Facility.
The Facility also provides for the issuance of up to $100 million of letters of credit, so long as there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the Facility.
At December 31, 2019, there was $25.0 million of commercial paper outstanding, there were approximately $20 million of outstanding standby letters of credit issued against the Facility and there were no borrowings outstanding under the Facility.
The net availability under the Facility was approximately $1.2 billion (See Footnote 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).In June 2019, the Company entered into a new factoring agreement with a financial institution to sell certain customer receivables at a more attractive discount rate than its previous cash discount terms offered to these customers (the “Customer Receivables Purchase Agreement”).
The Company received approximately $201 million under the new agreement during the second quarter of 2019.
The balance of the factored receivables at December 31, 2019, remained substantially unchanged from the balance at June 30, 2019.
Transactions under this agreement are accounted for as sales of accounts receivable, and the receivables are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the time of the sales transaction.
The Company classifies the proceeds received from the sales of accounts receivable as an operating cash flow in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
The Company records the discount as other expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.In October 2019, the Company refinanced its then existing receivables purchase agreement.
The new $600 million receivables purchase agreement matures in October 2022 (the “Securitization Facility”) and bears interest at a margin over a variable interest rate.
The Company was not in default of any of its debt covenants at December 31, 2019.Under the Company’s then existing SRP, which expired on December 31, 2019 and was not extended, the Company could repurchase up to approximately $3.6 billion of its outstanding common stock through a combination of 10b5-1 automatic trading plans, discretionary market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions.
During 2019, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock under its existing SRP.
39Table of ContentsRisk ManagementFrom time to time, the Company enters into derivative transactions to hedge its exposures to interest rate, foreign currency rate and commodity price fluctuations.
The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes.Interest Rate ContractsThe Company manages its fixed and floating rate debt mix using interest rate swaps.
The Company may use fixed and floating rate swaps to alter its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on its consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest.
Floating rate swaps would be used, depending on market conditions, to convert the fixed rates of long-term debt into short-term variable rates.
Fixed rate swaps would be used to reduce the Company’s risk of the possibility of increased interest costs.
Interest rate swap contracts are therefore used by the Company to separate interest rate risk management from the debt funding decision.
The cash paid and received from the settlement of interest rate swaps is included in interest expense.Fair Value HedgesAt December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately $377 million notional amount of interest rate swaps that exchange a fixed rate of interest for variable rate (LIBOR) of interest plus a weighted average spread.
These floating rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges against $277 million of principal on the 4.7% senior notes due 2020 and $100 million of principal on the 4.0% senior notes due 2024 (the "2024 Notes") for the remaining life of these notes.
The effective portion of the fair value gains or losses on these swaps is offset by fair value adjustments in the underlying debt.During 2019, the Company terminated approximately $150 million notional amount of these floating rate swaps and received consideration of $5.6 million, which is included in net cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for 2019.
These floating rate swaps that were designated as fair value hedges, were terminated in connection with the extinguishment of a portion of the principal balance of the 2024 Notes pursuant to the Tender Offers (see Footnote 10).
The termination of these floating rate swaps resulted in a total gain of $5.7 million, which is included in loss on extinguishment for 2019 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Cross-Currency ContractsThe Company uses cross-currency swaps to hedge foreign currency risk on certain intercompany financing arrangements with foreign subsidiaries.
During 2018, all the Company’s cross-currency interest rate swaps matured.
The cross-currency interest rate swaps were intended to eliminate uncertainty in cash flows in U.S.
Dollars and British Pounds in connection with the intercompany financing arrangements.Foreign Currency ContractsThe Company uses forward foreign currency contracts to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate exposure on the cash flows related to forecasted inventory purchases and sales and have maturity dates through December 2020.
The derivatives used to hedge these forecasted transactions that meet the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The effective portion of the gains or losses on these derivatives is deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is recognized in earnings at the same time that the hedged item affects earnings and is included in the same caption in the statements of operations as the underlying hedged item.
At December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately $516 million notional amount outstanding of forward foreign currency contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted inventory purchases and sales.The Company also uses foreign currency contracts, primarily forward foreign currency contracts, to mitigate the foreign currency exposure of certain other foreign currency transactions.
At December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately $667 million notional amount outstanding of these foreign currency contracts that are not designated as effective hedges for accounting purposes and have maturity dates through December 2020.
Fair market value gains or losses are included in the results of operations and are classified in other (income) expense, net.40Table of ContentsCommodity ContractsTo a lesser extent, the Company also enters into commodity-based derivatives in order to mitigate the risk that the rising price of these commodities could have on the cost of certain of the Company’s raw materials.
These commodity-based derivatives provide the Company with cost certainty.
At December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately $0.1 million notional amount outstanding of commodity-based derivatives that are designated as effective hedges for accounting purposes and have maturity dates through January 2020.
Fair market value gains or losses are included in the results of operations and are classified in cost of products sold.The following table presents the fair value of derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2019 (in millions): Asset(Liability)Derivatives designated as effective hedges: Cash flow hedges: Foreign currency contracts$(11.6)Commodity contracts(0.1)Fair value hedges: Interest rate swaps1.2Derivatives not designated as effective hedges: Foreign currency contracts5.6Total$(4.9)Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company has outstanding debt obligations maturing at various dates through 2046.
Certain other items, such as purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized as liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed.
Examples of items not recognized as liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received at December 31, 2019, and other noncancelable obligations including capital assets and other licensing services.The following table summarizes the effect, that material contractual obligations and commitments are expected to have on the Company’s cash flow in the indicated period at December 31, 2019.

(6)Total does not include contractual obligations reported on the December 31, 2019 balance sheet as current liabilities, except for current portion of long-term debt, short-term debt and accrued interest.The Company also has liabilities for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company is under audit from time-to-time by the IRS and other taxing authorities, and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming year.
While it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will be settled over time; therefore, the $474 million in unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2019, is excluded from the preceding table.
See Footnote 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Additionally, the Company has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement benefit plans, which are excluded from the preceding table.
The timing and amounts of the funding requirements are uncertain because they are dependent on interest rates and actual returns on plan assets, among other factors.
See Footnote 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.At December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately $63 million in standby letters of credit primarily related to the Company’s self-insurance programs, including workers’ compensation, product liability and medical.
See Footnote 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.At December 31, 2019, the Company did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe Company’s significant accounting policies are more fully described in Footnote 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
As disclosed in that footnote, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes.
Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty.
Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment.
Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The following sections describe the Company’s critical accounting policies.Revenue RecognitionThe Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied and are recognized at a point in time, which generally occurs either on shipment or on delivery based on contractual terms, which is also when control is transferred.
The Company’s primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of its consumer and commercial products to its customers.
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration for which it expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or providing services.
Certain customers may receive cash and/or non-cash incentives such as cash discounts, returns, credits or reimbursements related to defective products, customer discounts (such as volume or trade discounts), cooperative advertising and other customer-related programs, which are accounted for as variable consideration.
In some cases, the Company must apply judgment, including contractual rates and historical payment trends, when estimating variable consideration.In addition, the Company participates in various programs and arrangements with customers designed to increase the sale of products by these customers.
Among the programs negotiated are arrangements under which allowances are earned by customers for attaining agreed-upon sales levels or for participating in specific marketing programs.
Coupon programs are also developed on a customer- and territory-specific basis with the intent of increasing sales by all customers.
Under customer programs and arrangements that require sales incentives to be paid in advance, the Company amortizes the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume.
When incentives are paid in arrears, the Company accrues the estimated amount to be paid based on the program’s contractual terms, expected customer performance and/or estimated sales volume.
These estimates are determined using historical customer experience and other factors, which sometimes require significant judgment.
Due to the length of time necessary to obtain relevant data from customers, among other factors, actual amounts paid can differ from these estimates.42Table of ContentsCertain costs and cash payments made to customers previously recorded in costs of products sold and selling, general and administrative expenses are recorded as a reduction of net sales as they do not meet the specific criteria to qualify as a distinct good or service, primarily related to payments to customers for defective products under warranty.Sales taxes and other similar taxes are excluded from revenue.
The Company elected to account for shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost as permitted by the standard.
The Company also elected not to disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which revenue is recognized at the amount to which the Company has the right to invoice for services performed.Inventory ReservesThe Company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow-moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.Business CombinationsThe Company allocates purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values.
The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from customer relationships, tradenames and trademarks and acquired patents and developed technology; the period of time the Company expects to use the acquired intangible asset; and discount rates.
In estimating the future cash flows, the Company considers demand, competition and other economic factors.
The Company’s estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates, which could result in impairment charges in the future.
Estimates associated with the accounting for business combinations may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which could result in adjustments to the values of tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired or could result in future income or expenses.The Company considers various factors in determining whether an acquired trademark or tradename has an indefinite life.
In assessing whether an acquired trademark or tradename has an indefinite life, the Company considers legal and regulatory provisions that may limit the useful life, customer loyalty, brand strength and positioning, the effects of obsolescence and other economic factors, the Company’s plans for incorporating the trademark or tradename into its brand portfolio and the Company’s historical experience in using and renewing similar assets.
The Company considers all other acquired intangible assets definite-lived assets and generally amortizes the assets on a straight-line basis.
The Company determines the amortizable life of acquired definite-lived intangible assets based on the number of years over which a significant amount of the discounted cash flows contributes to the estimated fair value of the asset.The Company accounts for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination.
A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred.
When estimating the costs of exiting facilities, estimates are made regarding future sublease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results.
As a result, the Company may be required to revise its estimates which may affect the Company’s results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made.Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived IntangiblesGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles have historically been tested and reviewed for impairment annually (during the third quarter), or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant.
During the second quarter of 2019, the Company changed the date of its annual impairment testing from July 1 to December 1.
The change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with the Company’s annual planning and budgeting process, as well as its long-term planning and forecasting process.43Table of ContentsPursuant to the authoritative accounting literature, in 2019 the Company was required to perform an annual impairment testing as of the first day of its third quarter of 2019 (July 1), as well as December 1 to ensure that the change in impairment testing date did not delay or avoid an impairment charge.
As such the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing at July 1, 2019 and December 1, 2019, at which dates the Company’s goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles attributable to continuing operations were: Carrying Values at(in billions)July 1, 2019December 1, 2019Goodwill$3.7$3.7Indefinite-lived intangibles$4.6$3.6GoodwillGoodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, and all of the Company’s goodwill is assigned to its reporting units.
Reporting units are determined based upon the Company’s organizational structure in place at the date of the goodwill impairment testing and generally one level below the operating segment level.
As a result of the ATP, which resulted in a number of businesses designated as held for sale, as well as the Company’s decision to retain the Commercial Business, the Company’s continuing operations are comprised of eight reporting units, within its four primary operating segments.
In 2019, the Company bypassed the qualitative approach to testing goodwill and used a quantitative approach, which involves comparing the fair value of each of the reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units.
If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss would be calculated as the difference between these amounts, limited to the amount of reporting unit goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.The quantitative goodwill impairment testing requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, such as the identification of reporting units; the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units; and the estimation of future cash flows, business growth rates, terminal values, discount rates and total enterprise value.
The income approach used is the discounted cash flow methodology and is based on five-year cash flow projections.
The cash flows projected are analyzed on a “debt-free” basis (before cash payments to equity and interest-bearing debt investors) in order to develop an enterprise value from operations for the reporting unit.
A provision is made, based on these projections, for the value of the reporting unit at the end of the forecast period, or terminal value.
The present value of the finite-period cash flows and the terminal value are determined using a selected discount rate.
The Company estimated the fair values of its reporting units based on discounted cash flow methodology reflecting the latest projections which included, among other things, the impact of tariffs on Chinese imports, as well as other inflation at the time for the Company’s impairment testing performed during the third and fourth quarter of 2019.The fair values of each of the reporting units in both the third and fourth quarters of 2019 exceeded the respective carrying values of the reporting units.
Consequently, there were no goodwill impairment charges recorded during 2019 as a result of the impairment testing performed during the third and fourth quarter (see Footnote 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
During the fourth quarter impairment testing, all of the Company’s reporting units, with the exception of Appliances and Cookware, fair value exceeded their respective carrying value by more than 10%.
An increase of 100 basis points in the discount rates used in the discounted cash flows to estimate fair values of the Appliances and Cookware reporting unit would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $66 million during the fourth quarter of 2019.
Although the Company did not have any impaired goodwill in 2019 in conjunction with its annual impairment testing, the Company recorded impairment charges of $158 million in continuing operations in 2019, which reflect the decreases in carrying values of goodwill for Mapa/Spontex and Quickie while these businesses were classified as held for sale.
In 2019, the Company also recorded an impairment charge of approximately $11.5 million in continuing operations in connection with a prior period overstatement of the Company's state income tax receivable, partially offset by a $8.8 million benefit in continuing operations related to change in uncertain tax positions, also related to a prior period.
See Footnotes 1 and 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.44Table of ContentsIndefinite-lived intangiblesThe testing of indefinite-lived intangibles (primarily trademarks and tradenames) under established guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions (such as cash flow projections, royalty rates, terminal values and discount rates).
For impairment testing purposes, the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is determined using the same method which was used for determining the initial value.
The first method is the relief from royalty method, which estimates the value of a tradename by discounting the hypothetical avoided royalty payments to their present value over the economic life of the asset.
The second method, the excess earnings method, estimates the value of the intangible asset by quantifying the residual (or excess) cash flows generated by the asset and discounts those cash flows to the present.
The excess earnings methodology requires the application of contributory asset charges.
Contributory asset charges typically include assumed payments for the use of working capital, tangible assets and other intangible assets.
Changes in forecasted operations and other assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair values.
Changes in business conditions could potentially require adjustments to these asset valuations.During the third quarter of 2019, the Company recorded impairment charges of $824 million related to various tradenames within its reporting units as follows:•Tradenames within the Appliances and Cookware segment, primarily from the Jarden acquisition, were impaired by $607 million as their carrying values exceeded their fair values.
The carrying value of certain tradenames exceeded their fair value primarily due to the recently announced tariffs at the time of the third quarter impairment test, as well as a decline in sales volume due to a loss in market share for certain appliance categories from newly launched competitive products.
Both of these factors resulted in downward revisions to forecasted results.
•Tradenames within the Home and Outdoor Living segment were impaired by $217 million as their carrying values exceeded their fair values, primarily within the Home Fragrance reporting unit.
While the Home Fragrance reporting unit has experienced growth, the reporting unit has begun to experience a shift in product mix that is expected to continue into the future, which resulted in a downward revision to forecasted results for one of its tradenames.There were no impairments of the Company’s tradenames within the Learning and Development or Food and Commercial segments during the third quarter of 2019.
During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recorded impairment charges of approximately $76.6 million related to various tradenames within its reporting units as follows:•Tradenames within the Home and Outdoor Living segment were impaired by approximately $52.4 million as their carrying values exceeded their fair values, within the Outdoor and Recreation reporting unit as a result of downward revisions to forecasted results for three of its tradenames.
An increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate used in the discounted cash flows to estimate fair values of these tradenames would have resulted in an increase to the impairment charge of approximately $60 million.
The remaining carrying value of tradenames within this segment is approximately $1.6 billion.•Tradenames within the Learning and Development segment were impaired by approximately $24.2 million as their carrying values exceeded their fair values, within the Writing reporting unit.
The Writing reporting unit continues to experience softening trends in sales of slime-related adhesive products.
Related sales of such products during the fourth quarter of 2019 deteriorated at a faster rate than expected, which resulted in a downward revision to forecasted results for one of its tradenames.
The rate and duration of the decline for such products, which is expected to continue into the future, is difficult to predict.
Further impairments of this tradename may also occur if future expected cash flows are not achieved.
An increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate used in the discounted cash flows to estimate fair value of this tradename would have resulted in an increase to the impairment charge of approximately $18 million.
The remaining carrying value of tradenames within this segment is approximately $609 million.The remaining tradenames within the Company's Home and Outdoor Living and Learning and Development segments with no impairment during the fourth quarter of 2019 impairment test had carrying values of $1.1 billion and $433 million, respectively, with $555 million and $241 million of those with fair values in excess of 10% of carrying values, respectively.
An increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate used in the discounted cash flows to estimate fair values of the Home and Outdoor Living and Learning and Development tradenames would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $41 million and $21 million, respectively.There were no impairments of the Company’s tradenames within the Appliances and Cookware or Food and Commercial segments during the fourth quarter of 2019 impairment test.
The remaining carrying value of tradenames within these segments were approximately $146 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, with $115 million and $854 million of those tradenames with fair values 45Table of Contentsin excess of 10% of the carrying values, respectively.
An increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate used in the discounted cash flows to estimate fair values of the Appliances and Cookware and Food and Commercial tradenames would have resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $2 million and $30 million, respectively.
Some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units are outside the control of management, including interest rates, cost of capital, tax rates, credit ratings, foreign exchange rates, labor inflation, tariffs, and industry growth.
Given the current trade negotiations with China and the uncertainties regarding the financial potential impact on the Company's business, there can be no assurance that the Company's estimates and assumptions regarding the impact of tariffs made for purposes of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2019 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future.
The Company’s Appliances and Cookware, Consumer and Commercial, and Outdoor and Recreation businesses units are most sensitive to changes in tariffs.
While the Company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair values of the reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, it is possible changes could occur.
As for all the Company’s reporting units, if in future years, the reporting unit’s actual results are not consistent with the Company’s estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, the Company may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets.
The Company will continue to monitor its reporting units for any triggering events or other signs of impairment.
The Company may be required to perform additional impairment testing based on changes in the economic environment, disruptions to the Company’s business, significant declines in operating results of the Company’s reporting units and/or tradenames, further sustained deterioration of the Company’s market capitalization, and other factors, which could result in impairment charges in the future.
Although management cannot predict when improvements in macroeconomic conditions will occur, if consumer confidence and consumer spending decline significantly in the future or if commercial and industrial economic activity or the market capitalization deteriorates significantly from current levels, it is reasonably likely the Company will be required to record impairment charges in the future.In addition to the charges recorded as a result of the annual impairment testing in 2019, the Company recorded in continuing operations approximately $153 million of additional impairment charges, which reflect the decreases in carrying values of indefinite-lived intangible assets in the Mapa/Spontex and Quickie businesses while they were classified as held for sale.
Additional impairment charges of $112 million were recorded in discontinued operations for businesses divested in 2019.See Footnote 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Valuation of Assets Held for SaleAt December 31, 2019, the Company did not have any disposal groups classified as held for sale.
Upon designation as held for sale, the Company’s disposal groups are assessed for impairment by comparing the fair value of the disposal groups to their carrying values.
The fair value of the disposal groups is estimated using a market multiple approach.
The Company uses various assumptions to estimate fair value under the market multiple approach, including estimating the market multiples expected from the eventual sale of the disposal groups based on information obtained as a result of its marketing process.
See Footnote 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.During 2019, as the result of the Company’s valuation assessment of its disposal groups, which included the Mapa/Spontex and Quickie businesses prior to the Company’s decision to retain such businesses, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $158 million specifically related to the Mapa/Spontex and Quickie businesses and indefinite-lived tradename impairment charges of $153 million specifically related to the Mapa/Spontex and Quickie businesses.
These impairment charges totaling $311 million are included in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2019 in the Food and Commercial segment as a result of the Company’s decision to retain such businesses, which results have been reclassified to continuing operations in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations.46Table of ContentsCapitalized Software CostsThe Company capitalizes costs associated with internal-use software during the application development stage after both the preliminary project stage has been completed and the Company’s management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development.
Capitalized internal-use software costs include: (i) external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software; (ii) payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project; and (iii) interest costs incurred while developing the software.
Capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose.
The Company expenses as incurred research and development, general and administrative, and indirect costs associated with internal-use software.
In addition, the Company expenses as incurred training, maintenance and other internal-use software costs incurred during the post-implementation stage.
Costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of internal-use software are capitalized only if such modifications result in additional functionality of the software.
The Company amortizes internal-use software costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software.
Capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of impairment, including but not limited to a significant change in available technology or the manner in which the software is being used.
Impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values.
Capitalized implementation costs for certain qualified cloud computing Software as a Service arrangements are included in prepaid expenses and other current in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the straight-line amortization of the costs is presented along with the fees related to the hosted cloud computing service in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Other Long-Lived AssetsThe Company continuously evaluates whether impairment indicators related to its property, plant and equipment, operating leases and other long-lived assets are present.
These impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset or asset group, early termination of an operating lease, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition, or a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group.
If impairment indicators are present, the Company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets.
The sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount.
The cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future sales and expenses, working capital and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the Company’s forecasts.
If the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, the Company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group.
Generally, the Company performs its testing of the asset group at the reporting unit level, as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available.Product Liability ReservesThe Company has a self-insurance program for product liability that includes reserves for self-retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance.
The Company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods, review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves.
The Company’s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the Company’s product liability reserve.
While the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims, the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the Company, and such additional losses may be material to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.Legal and Environmental ReservesThe Company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, as well as contract and other disputes.
The Company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and estimates the probability and amount of loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows.
The estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated.
No insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the Company’s cost estimates or reserve, nor do the Company’s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes, except with respect to long-term operations and maintenance, Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and other matters which are estimated at present value.
47Table of ContentsIncome TaxesThe Company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach.
Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by current enacted tax rates.
Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.
The Company’s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by various worldwide tax authorities.
Although the Company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, it has established tax, interest and penalty reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken, which could result in additional liabilities for taxes, interest and penalties.
The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies.For uncertain tax positions, the Company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance, which requires application of a “more likely than not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions.
The Company’s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the Company’s effective tax rate, as well as impact operating results.The Company’s provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be favorably or adversely affected by earnings being higher or lower in countries that have lower tax rates and higher or lower in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities; by expiration of or lapses in tax-related legislation; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by changes in accounting principles; by liquidity needs driving repatriations of non-U.S. cash to the U.S.; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, including possible U.S. changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules.The Company’s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign tax rates, tax credits, the domestic manufacturing deduction, tax audit settlements and valuation allowance adjustments.
Significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions, determining valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets, and ultimately, the income tax provision.It is difficult to predict when resolution of income tax matters will occur and when recognition of certain income tax assets and liabilities is appropriate, and the Company’s income tax expense in the future may continue to differ from the statutory rate because of the effects of similar items.
For example, if items are favorably resolved or management determines a deferred tax asset is realizable that was previously reserved, the Company will recognize period tax benefits.
Conversely, to the extent tax matters are unfavorably resolved or management determines a valuation allowance is necessary for a tax asset that was not previously reserved, the Company will recognize incremental period tax expense.
These matters are expected to contribute to the tax rate differing from the statutory rate and continued volatility in the Company’s effective tax rate.See Footnote 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Pensions and Postretirement BenefitsThe Company records annual amounts relating to its pension and postretirement plans based on calculations, which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates.
The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so.
The effect of modifications is generally deferred and amortized over future periods.
The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience, market conditions and the input from its actuaries and investment advisors.
The pension and postretirement obligations are measured at December 31 for 2019 and 2018.The Company employs a total return investment approach for its pension and postretirement benefit plans whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of pension plan assets.
The intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by outperforming plan liabilities over the long run.
Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition.
The investment portfolios contain a diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments.
Furthermore, equity investments are diversified across geography and market capitalization through investments in U.S. large-capitalization stocks, U.S. small-capitalization stocks and international securities.
Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.48Table of ContentsThe expected long-term rate of return for plan assets is based upon many factors including expected asset allocations, historical asset returns, current and expected future market conditions, risk and active management premiums.
The target asset allocations for the Company’s domestic pension plans may vary by plan, based in part due to plan demographics, funded status and liability duration.
In general, the Company’s target asset allocations are as follows: equities approximately 20% to 40%; fixed income approximately 40% to 60%; and cash, alternative investments and other, approximately 10% to 30% at December 31, 2019.
Actual asset allocations may vary from the targeted allocations for various reasons, including market conditions and the timing of transactions.
The Company maintains numerous international defined benefit pension plans.
The asset allocations for the international investment may vary by plan and jurisdiction and are primarily based upon the plan structure and plan participant profile.
At December 31, 2019, the domestic plan assets were allocated as follows: Equities: approximately 19% and Other Investments (alternative investments, fixed-income securities, cash and other): approximately 81%.
Actual asset allocations may vary from the targeted allocations for various reasons, including market conditions and the timing of transactions.
For 2019, 2018 and 2017, the actual return (loss) on plan assets for the Company’s U.S. pension plan assets was approximately $213 million, ($71) million and $172 million, respectively, versus an expected return on plan assets of approximately $59 million, $68 million and $73 million, respectively.
The actual amount of future contributions will depend, in part, on long-term actual return on assets and future discount rates.
Pension contributions for all the Company’s pension plans for 2020 are estimated to be approximately $24 million, which is consistent with the 2019 contributions.The weighted average expected return on plan assets assumption for 2019 was approximately 4.4% for the Company’s pension plans.
The weighted average discount rate at the 2019 measurement date used to measure the pension and postretirement benefit obligations was approximately 2.7% and 2.8%, respectively.
A 25 basis points decrease in the discount rate at the 2019 measurement date would increase the pension plans’ projected benefit obligation by approximately $61 million.The healthcare cost trend rates used in valuing the Company’s postretirement benefit obligation are established based upon actual healthcare cost trends and consultation with actuaries and benefit providers.
At the 2019 measurement date, the current weighted average healthcare cost trend rate assumption was approximately 6.7%.
The current healthcare cost trend rate gradually decreases to an ultimate healthcare cost trend rate of 4.5%.
A one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would not have a material effect on the postretirement benefit obligation or the service and interest cost components of postretirement benefit costs.See Footnote 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans.RestructuringThe Company has and expects to continue to engage in restructuring activities, which requires management to utilize significant estimates related to the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reductions and other separation programs and other exit costs associated with restructuring activities.
The Company's accrual for severance and other employee separation costs depends on whether the costs result from an ongoing severance plan or are one-time costs.
The Company accounts for relevant expenses as severance costs when we have an established severance policy, statutory requirements dictate the severance amounts, or historical experience, if applicable.
The Company recognize these costs when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable.The Company estimates the one-time severance and other employee costs related to exit and disposal activities not resulting from an ongoing severance plan based on the benefits available to the employees being terminated.
The Company recognizes these costs when we identify the specific classification or functions of the employees being terminated, notify the employees who might be included in the termination, and expect to terminate employees within the legally required notification period.
When employees are receiving incentives to stay beyond the legally required notification period, we record the cost of their severance over the remaining service period.Recent Accounting PronouncementsA summary of recent accounting pronouncements is included in Footnote 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.49Table of ContentsInternational OperationsFor 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company’s non-U.S. businesses accounted for approximately 33%, 33% and 32% of net sales, respectively (see Footnote 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).Forward-Looking StatementsForward-looking statements in this Report are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMarket RiskIn general, business enterprises can be exposed to market risks including fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices, and that can affect the cost of operating, investing and financing under those conditions.
The Company believes it has moderate exposure to these risks.
The Company assesses market risk based on changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates and commodity prices utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential loss in earnings, fair values and cash flows based on hypothetical changes in rates and prices.The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its variable rate debt and price risk on its fixed rate debt.
As such, the Company monitors the interest rate environment and uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate risk and price risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable interest rates while attempting to minimize interest costs.
At December 31, 2019, approximately $377 million of the Company’s debt carries a variable rate of interest either by nature or through the use of interest rate swaps.
The remainder of the debt (approximately $5.3 billion) carries a fixed rate of interest.
Based upon the Company’s debt structure at December 31, 2019, a hypothetical 1% increase in these interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately $3.8 million and decrease the fair value of debt by approximately $323 million.While the Company transacts business predominantly in U.S. dollars and most of its revenues are collected in U.S. dollars, a substantial portion of the Company’s operating costs are denominated in other currencies, such as the Brazilian Real, British Pound, Canadian dollar, European Euro, Japanese Yen and Mexican Peso.
Changes in the relation of these and other currencies to the U.S. dollar will affect Company’s sales and profitability and could result in exchange losses.
For 2019, approximately 33% of the Company’s sales were denominated in foreign currencies, the most significant of which were: European Euro, approximately 10%; and Canadian dollar, approximately 4%.
The primary purpose of the Company’s foreign currency hedging activities is to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate exposure on the cash flows related to forecasted inventory purchases and sales.
A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on foreign currency gains and losses related to the foreign currency derivatives or the net fair value of the Company’s foreign currency derivatives.The Company is exposed to the price risk that the rising cost of commodities has on certain of its raw materials.
As such, the Company monitors the commodities markets and from time to time the Company enters into commodity-based derivatives in order to mitigate the impact that the rising price of these commodities has on the cost of certain of the Company’s raw materials.
A hypothetical 10% change in the commodity prices underlying the derivatives would not have a material effect on the related gains and losses included in the Company’s results of operations.
In this sensitivity analysis, all other assumptions are constant and assumes that a change in one currency’s rate relative to the U.S. dollar would not impact another currency’s rates relative to the U.S. dollar.The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to its derivative financial instruments, all of which are highly rated institutions; however, the Company does not anticipate non-performance by such counterparties.The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.51Table of Contents
