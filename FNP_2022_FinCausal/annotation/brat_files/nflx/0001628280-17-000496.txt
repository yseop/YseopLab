Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverview and Results of OperationsThe following represents our consolidated performance highlights: As of/ Year Ended December 31, Change 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014 (in thousands, except revenue per membership and percentages)Global streaming memberships 93,796 74,762 57,391 25% 30 %Global streaming average monthly revenue per paying membership $8.61 $8.15 $8.20 6% (1)%Revenues $8,830,669 $6,779,511 $5,504,656 30% 23 %Operating income $379,793 $305,826 $402,648 24% (24)%Net income $186,678 $122,641 $266,799 52% (54)%Consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to growth in the average number of paid streaming memberships globally, the majority of which was growth in our international memberships reflecting our expansion and focus on Netflix as a global internet TV network.
The impact from membership growth was coupled with an increase in global streaming average monthly revenue per paying membership resulting from price changes and plan mix partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations impacting our International streaming segment.
The increase in operating income and net income is due primarily to increased revenues partially offset by increased content expenses as we continue to acquire, license and produce content, including more Netflix originals, as well as increased marketing and headcount costs to support our international expansion.
Net income was further impacted by the increase in interest expense associated with our debt issuances as well as to an increase in our effective tax rate, slightly offset by gains on foreign currency denominated transactions.
We intend to focus on growing our global operating margin in 2017.
We offer three types of streaming membership plans.
In the U.S. our "basic" plan is priced at $7.99 per month and includes access to standard definition quality streaming on a single screen at a time.
Our "standard" plan is our most popular streaming plan and is priced at $9.99 per month and includes access to high definition quality streaming on two screens concurrently.
Our "premium" plan is priced at $11.99 per month and includes access to high definition and ultra-high definition quality content on four screens concurrently.
Internationally, the membership plans are structured similarly to the U.S. and range in price from the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $5.00 to $18.00 per month.We expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change.
For instance, in May 2014, in the U.S., we increased the price of our standard plan from $7.99 per month to $8.99 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a two year period.
In October 2015, in the U.S., we increased the price of this same standard plan from $8.99 per month to $9.99 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a one year period.
In 2016, we phased out grandfathered pricing, giving members the option of electing the basic streaming plan at $7.99 per month, continuing on the standard streaming plan at the higher price of $9.99 per month, or electing the premium plan at $11.99 per month.
The following represents the key elements to our segment results of operations:•We define contribution profit (loss) as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses incurred by the segment.
We believe this is an important measure of our operating segment performance as it represents each segment's performance before global corporate costs.•For the Domestic and International streaming segments, content expenses, which include the amortization of the streaming content assets and other expenses associated with the licensing and acquisition of streaming content, represent the vast majority of cost of revenues.
Streaming content rights were generally obtained for our current geographic regions.
As we expanded internationally, we obtained additional rights for the new geographies.
With our global expansion, we now aspire to obtain global rights for our content.
We allocate this content between the Domestic and International segments based on estimated fair market value.
Other cost of revenues such as streaming delivery expenses, customer service and payment processing fees, including those we pay to our integrated payment partners, tend to be lower as a percentage of total cost of revenues .
We have built our own global content delivery network ("Open Connect") to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet.
Streaming 18Table of Contentsdelivery expenses, therefore, include equipment costs related to Open Connect and all third-party costs, such as cloud computing costs, associated with delivering streaming content over the internet.
Cost of revenues in the Domestic DVD segment consist primarily of delivery expenses, content expenses, including amortization of DVD content assets and revenue sharing expenses, and other expenses associated with our DVD processing and customer service centers.
Delivery expenses for the Domestic DVD segment consist of the postage costs to mail DVDs to and from our members and the packaging and label costs for the mailers.•For the Domestic and International streaming segments, marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and payments made to our partners including device partners, MVPD's, mobile platforms and ISP's.
Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising.
Payments to our partners include fixed fee and /or revenue sharing payments.
Marketing expenses are incurred by our Domestic and International streaming segments given our focus on building consumer awareness of the streaming offerings, and in particular our original content.
Marketing expenses incurred by our International streaming segment have been significant and fluctuate dependent upon the number of international territories in which our streaming service is offered and the timing of the launch of new territories.
•We have demonstrated our ability to grow domestic streaming contribution margin as evidenced by the increase in contribution margin from 17% in 2012 to 36% in 2016.
As a result of our focus on growing the streaming segments, contribution margins for the Domestic and International streaming segments are lower than for our Domestic DVD segment.

 Year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 In the Domestic streaming segment, we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members in the United States.
The increase in our domestic streaming revenues was due to a 12% growth in the average number of paid memberships and an 8% increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership.
The average monthly revenue per paying membership for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased by 15% compared to the same quarter in prior year.
These increases in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and plan mix.
In 2016, we phased out grandfathered pricing and cancellations by members whose grandfathered pricing expired were not material.
Our standard plan continues to be the most popular plan choice for new memberships.
The increase in domestic streaming cost of revenues was primarily due to a $335.4 million increase in content expenses relating to our existing and new streaming content, including more exclusive and original programming.
In addition, we had a $33.2 million increase in other costs, such as payment processing fees and customer service call centers, due to our growing member base.Domestic marketing expenses increased primarily due to an increase in advertising and public relations spending as well as increased payments to our partners.Our Domestic streaming segment had a contribution margin of 36% for the year ended December 31, 2016, which increased as compared to the contribution margin of 33% for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to growth in paid memberships and revenue, which continued to outpace content and marketing spending.
Year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 The increase in our domestic streaming revenues was due to a 17% growth in the average number of paid memberships and a 4% increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulting from our price changes and plan mix.
The increase in domestic streaming cost of revenues was primarily due to a $208.1 million increase in content expenses relating to our existing and new streaming content, including more exclusive and original programming.

 In the International streaming segment, we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members outside the United States.
We launched our streaming service in Canada in September 2010 and have expanded our services internationally as shown below.
Year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 The increase in our international revenues was due to the 57% growth in the average number of paid international memberships and a 4% increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership.
The average monthly revenue per paying membership for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased by 10% compared to the same quarter in prior year.
These increases in average monthly revenue per paying membership were due to price changes and plan mix, offset partially by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
We estimate that international revenues would have been approximately $174 million higher in the year ended December 31, 2016 if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with those for the year ended December 31, 2015.
If foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate more than expected, revenues and average revenue per paying membership may differ from our expectations.
Average paid international streaming memberships accounted for 43% of total average paid streaming memberships as of December 31, 2016, as compared to 35% of total average paid streaming memberships as of December 31, 2015.The increase in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a $998.5 million increase in content expenses relating to our existing and new streaming content, including more exclusive and original programming.
Other costs increased $132.5 million primarily due to increases in our streaming delivery expenses, costs associated with our customer service call centers and payment processing fees, all driven by our growing member base, partially offset by decreases resulting from exchange rate 21Table of Contentsfluctuations.
International marketing expenses increased mainly due to expenses for territories launched in the last eighteen months.International contribution losses decreased $24.9 million year over year due to growth in paid memberships and revenue, which outpaced the growth in marketing spending.
Year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 The increase in our international revenues was due to the 66% growth in the average number of paid international memberships offset partially by a 10% decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership.
The decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership was due to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations and to a lesser extent the impact of absorbing higher VAT rates across our European markets beginning January 1, 2015.
These decreases were partially offset by our pricing changes and plan mix.
We believe international revenues would have been approximately $331 million higher in 2015 if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with those for the year ended December 31, 2014.The increase in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a $522.1 million increase in content expenses primarily relating to expenses for territories launched in the last eighteen months, coupled with existing and new streaming content, including more exclusive and original programming.
Other costs increased $104.2 million primarily due to increases in our streaming delivery expenses, costs associated with our customer service call centers and payment processing fees, all driven by our growing member base, partially offset by decreases resulting from exchange rate fluctuations.
Average paid international streaming memberships accounted for 35% of total average paid streaming memberships as of December 31, 2015, as compared to 27% of total average paid streaming memberships as of December 31, 2014.International marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 mainly due to expenses for territories launched in the last eighteen months.International contribution losses increased $173.6 million year over year due to our increased spending for our international expansion and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

 Year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 In the Domestic DVD segment, we derive revenues from our DVD-by-mail membership services.
The price per plan for DVD-by-mail varies from $4.99 to $14.99 per month according to the plan chosen by the member.
DVD-by-mail plans differ by the number of DVDs that a member may have out at any given point.
Members electing access to high definition Blu-ray discs, in addition to standard definition DVDs, pay a surcharge ranging from $2 to $4 per month for our most popular plans.The decrease in our domestic DVD revenues was due to a 15% decrease in the average number of paid memberships.
The decrease in domestic DVD cost of revenues was primarily due to a $14.0 million decrease in content expenses and a $32.8 million decrease in delivery expenses resulting from a 18% decrease in the number of DVDs mailed to members.
The decrease in shipments was driven by a decline in the number of DVD memberships coupled with a decrease in usage by these 22Table of Contentsmembers.
Other costs, primarily those associated with processing and customer service expenses, decreased $14.4 million primarily due to a decrease in hub operation expenses resulting from the decline in DVD shipments.Our Domestic DVD segment had a contribution margin of 52% for the year ended December 31, 2016, up from 50% for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the decrease in DVD usage by paying members.

In the year ended December 31, 2015, the foreign exchange loss of $37.3 million was primarily driven by the remeasurement of significant content liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies in our European entities coupled with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.24Table of ContentsProvision for Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, Change 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014 (in thousands, except percentages)Provision for income taxes $73,829 $19,244 $82,570 $54,585 284% (63,326) (77)%Effective tax rate 28% 14% 24%
 Year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 The increase in our effective tax rate is mainly due to a $13.4 million release of tax reserves in 2015 and an increase in foreign taxes.
In 2016, the difference between our 28% effective tax rate and the Federal statutory rate of 35% was $17.3 million primarily due to the 2016 Federal and California research and development (“R&D”) credits partially offset by state income taxes, foreign taxes, and nondeductible expenses.
Year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 The decrease in our effective tax rate is mainly due to an increase in R&D credits and a decrease in state and local income taxes.
In 2015, the difference between our 14% effective tax rate and the Federal statutory rate of 35% was $30.4 million primarily due to a $13.4 million release of tax reserves on previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of an IRS audit settlement leading to the reassessment of our reserves for all open years, $16.5 million related to the retroactive reinstatement of the 2015 Federal R&D credit, as well as the California R&D credit; partially offset by state income taxes, foreign taxes and nondeductible expenses.
On December 18, 2015, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (H.R.
2029) was signed into law which retroactively and permanently extended the Federal R&D credit from January 1, 2015.
As a result, we recognized the retroactive benefit of the 2015 R&D credit as a discrete item in the fourth quarter of 2015, the period in which the legislation was enacted.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased $576.9 million from $2,310.7 million as of December 31, 2015 to $1,733.8 million as of December 31, 2016.
In October 2016, we issued $1,000.0 million of long-term debt.
The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by an increase in cash used in operations, partially offset by cash received from the issuance of debt.
Long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs, was $3,364.3 million and $2,371.4 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Our primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, streaming delivery, marketing programs and personnel-related costs.
Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content.
We expect to significantly increase our investments in global streaming content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity and may result in future negative free cash flows even after we achieve material global profitability.We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with available funds and access to financing sources, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months.
Our ability to obtain any additional financing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, financial condition and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing.
We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.
If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.As of December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries amounted to $278.5 million.
If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the portion associated with undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries.Free Cash FlowWe define free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating and investing activities excluding the non-operational cash flows from purchases, maturities and sales of short-term investments.
We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments in content and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content.
Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation 25Table of Contentsof, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, cash flow (used in) provided by operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.In assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the three major recurring differences are excess content payments over expense, non-cash stock-based compensation expense and other working capital differences.
The excess content payments over expense is variable based on the payment terms of our content agreements and is expected to increase as we enter into more agreements with upfront cash payments, such as licensing and production of original content.
In the last 12 months, the ratio of content payments over content expense was 1.4.
Working capital differences include deferred revenue, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt.
Our receivables from members generally settle quickly and deferred revenue is a source of cash flow.

The expected timing of the payment of the obligations discussed below is estimated based on information available to us as of December 31, 2016.
Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2016: Payments due by PeriodContractual obligations (in thousands): Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 yearsStreaming content obligations (1) $14,479,487 $6,200,611 $6,731,336 $1,386,934 $160,606Debt (2) 4,730,369 181,556 358,250 844,813 3,345,750Lease obligations (3) 640,840 64,502 144,766 124,037 307,535Other purchase obligations (4) 350,366 185,023 81,707 39,278 44,358Total $20,201,062 $6,631,692 $7,316,059 $2,395,062 $3,858,249 (1)As of December 31, 2016, streaming content obligations were comprised of $3.6 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $2.9 billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $8.0 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not then meet the criteria for recognition.Streaming content obligations increased $3.6 billion from $10.9 billion as of December 31, 2015 to $14.5 billion as of December 31, 2016 primarily due to multi-year commitments associated with the continued expansion of our exclusive and original programming.Streaming content obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of streaming content.
An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements.
An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles.
Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date.
Traditional film output deals, like the U.S. output deal with Disney, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements.
The contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years.
However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $3 billion to $5 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months.
The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ.
Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.
(2)Long-term debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments.
See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
27Table of Contents(3)Lease obligations include lease financing obligations of $18.5 million related to our current Los Gatos, California headquarters for which we are the deemed owner for accounting purposes, commitments of $530.2 million for our expanded headquarters in Los Gatos, California, and our new office space in Los Angeles, California and other commitments of $92.1 million for facilities under non-cancelable operating leases.
These leases have expiration dates varying through approximately 2027.
(4)Other purchase obligations include all other non-cancelable contractual obligations.
These contracts are primarily related to streaming delivery, DVD content acquisition, and miscellaneous open purchase orders for which we have not received the related services or goods.As of December 31, 2016, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $19.7 million which was classified in “Other non-current liabilities” and a reduction to deferred tax assets which was classified as "Other non-current assets" in the consolidated balance sheets.
At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have transactions with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to us.
IndemnificationsThe information set forth under Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Indemnification” is incorporated herein by reference.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods.
The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments.
Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.Streaming Content We acquire, license and produce content, including original programing, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of TV shows and films.
The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability.
Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense.
Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash used in (provided by) operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.For licenses we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming.
The portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as “Current content assets, net” and the remaining portion as “Non-current content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
For productions, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost and direct costs.
We include these amounts in "Non-current content assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.
Based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use, beginning with the month of first availability.
The amortization period typically ranges from six months to five years.
For content where we expect more upfront viewing, for instance due to additional merchandising and marketing efforts, we amortize on an accelerated basis.
We review factors that impact the 28Table of Contentsamortization of the content assets on a regular basis.
Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.
In the third quarter of 2016, we changed the amortization method of certain content given changes in estimated viewing patterns of this content.
The effect of this change in estimate was a $19.8 million decrease in operating income and a $12.3 million decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2016.
The effect on both basic and diluted earnings per share was a decrease of $0.03 for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Changes in our estimates could have a significant impact on our future results of operations.Our business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level.
Therefore, content assets, both licensed and produced, are reviewed in aggregate at the operating segment level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness or that the fair value may be less than amortized cost.
To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances.
If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost, net realizable value or fair value.
In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.
No material write-down from unamortized cost was recorded in any of the periods presented.Income TaxesWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method.
Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.
There was no significant valuation allowance as of December 31, 2016 or 2015.Although we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.
Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates.
However, we believe that it is more likely than not that substantially all deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets will ultimately be realized.
In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination.We did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes.
We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement.
At December 31, 2016, our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were $19.7 million of which $17.0 million, if recognized, would favorably impact our future earnings.
Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates.
See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.Stock-Based CompensationWe grant fully vested non-qualified stock options to our employees on a monthly basis.
As a result of immediate vesting, stock-based compensation expense is fully recognized on the grant date, and no estimate is required for post-vesting option forfeitures.
Stock-based compensation expense at the grant date is based on the total number of options granted and an estimate of the fair value of the awards.
•Expected Volatility: The Company calculates expected volatility based solely on implied volatility.
We believe that implied volatility of publicly traded options in our common stock is more reflective of market conditions and, given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of our common stock.
An increase/decrease of 10% in our computation of expected volatility would increase/decrease the total stock-based compensation expense by approximately $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.29Table of Contents•Suboptimal Exercise Factor: Our computation of the suboptimal exercise factor is based on historical and estimated option exercise behavior.
An increase/decrease in the suboptimal exercise factor of 10% would increase/decrease the total stock-based compensation expense by approximately $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.Recent Accounting PronouncementsThe information set forth under Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskWe are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our investments, debt and foreign currency fluctuations.Interest Rate RiskThe primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal, while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments without significantly increased risk.
To achieve this objective, we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk.
The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes.
We maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments in a variety of securities.
These securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within Stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had no impairment charges associated with our short-term investment portfolio.
Although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired.
Some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk due to changes in prevailing interest rates which may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate.
For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then-prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the value of our investment will decline.
At December 31, 2016, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds, which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.
Our short-term investments were comprised of corporate debt securities, government and agency securities and asset backed securities.Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of the securities we hold that are classified as short-term investments.
The table below separates these investments, based on stated maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates as of December 31, 2016.
(in thousands)Due within one year $61,833Due after one year and through 5 years 204,373Total $266,206A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2016.
The analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes.
This methodology assumes a more immediate change in interest rates to reflect the current economic environment.The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as short-term investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS and 150 BPS.
The analysis is shown as of December 31, 2016:
 Fair Value as of December 31, 2016(in thousands)-150 BPS -100 BPS -50 BPS +50 BPS +100 BPS +150 BPS$271,745 $270,151 $268,180 $264,234 $262,261 $260,289 30Table of Contents Based on investment positions as of December 31, 2016, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $3.9 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio.
As of December 31, 2015, a similar 100 basis point increase in the yield curve would have resulted in a $6.6 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio.
Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.As of December 31, 2016, we had $3.4 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in five tranches.
Refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances.
The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest.
Foreign Currency RiskInternational revenues and cost of revenues account for 36% and 48%, respectively, of consolidated amounts for the year ended December 31, 2016.
The majority of international revenues and a smaller portion of expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and we therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and the Brazilian real.Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and contribution profit (loss) of our International streaming segment as expressed in U.S. dollars.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, we believe our international revenues would have been approximately $174.4 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained consistent with those for the year ended December 31, 2015.We have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency.
In the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a $22.8 million foreign exchange gain which resulted primarily from the remeasurement of significant content liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies.We do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures.
The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy.
Our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations.Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary DataThe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes listed in Part IV, Item 15(a)(1) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are included immediately following Part IV hereof and incorporated by reference herein.Item 9.Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial DisclosureNone.Item 9A.Controls and Procedures(a)Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud.
A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Netflix have been detected.31Table of Contents (b)Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the Exchange Act)).
Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.
In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework).
Based on our assessment under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2016.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included herein.
(c)Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
32Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Netflix, Inc.We have audited Netflix, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
Netflix, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, Netflix, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Netflix, Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 of Netflix, Inc. and our report dated January 27, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
