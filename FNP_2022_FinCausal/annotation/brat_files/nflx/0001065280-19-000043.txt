Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsResults of OperationsThe following represents our consolidated performance highlights: As of/ Year Ended December 31, Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 (in thousands, except revenue per membership and percentages)Global Streaming Memberships:

International revenues accounted for 50% of total streaming revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 45% of total streaming revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The increase in consolidated revenues was primarily driven by the growth in the average number of streaming paid memberships globally, the majority of which was growth in our international memberships.
Average paid international streaming memberships accounted for 55% of total average streaming paid memberships as of December 31, 2018, as compared to 49% of total average streaming paid memberships as of December 31, 2017.
In addition, average monthly revenue per paying streaming membership increased primarily due to price changes and a shift in the plan mix towards higher priced plans.
The growth in paid net membership additions has been less volatile when compared to growth in total net membership additions as a result of free trial variability.
We therefore believe paid memberships is a more reliable indicator of revenue growth.The increase in operating margin is due primarily to increased revenues, partially offset by increased content expenses as we continue to acquire, license and produce content, including more Netflix originals, as well as increased marketing expenses and headcount costs to support continued improvements in our streaming service, our international expansion, and our growing content production activities.We offer three main types of streaming membership plans.
Our "basic" plan includes access to standard definition quality streaming on a single screen at a time.
Our "standard" plan is our most popular streaming plan and includes access to high definition quality streaming on two screens concurrently.
Our "premium" plan includes access to high definition and ultra-high definition quality content on four screens concurrently.
As of December 31, 2018, pricing on our plans ranged in the U.S. from $7.99 to $13.99 per month and internationally from the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $3 to $20 per month.
We expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may increase and we may occasionally test other plan and price variations.
The following represents the key elements to our segment results of operations:•We define contribution profit (loss) as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses incurred by the segment.
This represents each segment's performance before global corporate costs.
As markets within our International streaming segment become profitable, we increasingly focus on our global operating profit margin target as a measure of profitability.
•For the Domestic and International streaming segments, amortization of the streaming content assets makes up the majority of cost of revenues.
Increasingly, we obtain multi-territory or global rights for our streaming content and allocate these rights between Domestic and International streaming segments based on estimated fair market value.
19Table of ContentsExpenses associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of streaming content (such as payroll and related personnel expenses, costs associated with obtaining rights to music included in our content, overall deals with talent, miscellaneous production related costs and participations and residuals), streaming delivery costs and other operations costs, make up the remainder of cost of revenues.
We have built our own global content delivery network ("Open Connect") to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet.
Streaming delivery expenses, therefore, include equipment costs related to Open Connect, payroll and related personnel expenses and all third-party costs, such as cloud computing costs, associated with delivering streaming content over the internet.
Other operations costs include customer service and payment processing fees, including those we pay to our integrated payment partners, as well as other costs incurred in making our content available to members.
•For the Domestic and International streaming segments, marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to our marketing partners, including consumer electronics manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs.
Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising.
Marketing expenses also include payroll and related expenses for personnel that support the Company's marketing activities.
Marketing expenses are incurred by our Domestic and International streaming segments in order to build consumer awareness of the streaming offerings, and in particular our original content.

 Year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 In the Domestic streaming segment, we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members in the United States.
The 24% increase in our domestic streaming revenues was primarily due to the 11% growth in the average number of paid memberships, as well as a 12% increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership, resulting from our price changes and a shift in the plan mix towards higher priced plans.
Our standard plan continues to be the most popular plan choice for new memberships.
The increase in domestic streaming cost of revenues was primarily due to a $358 million increase in content amortization relating to our existing and new streaming content, including more exclusive and original programming.
Other costs increased $210 million primarily due to increases in expenses associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of streaming content as well as increased payment processing fees driven by our growing member base.
Domestic marketing expenses increased primarily due to an increase in advertising, driven by increased investments in marketing of new original titles.
The increase in marketing expenses is also attributable to increased public relations spending and payments to our partners.20Table of ContentsYear ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 The increase in our domestic streaming revenues was primarily due to a 10% growth in the average number of paid memberships and an 11% increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership.

 Year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 In the International streaming segment, we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members outside the United States.
The 53% increase in our international revenues was due to the 40% growth in the average number of paid international memberships, in addition to a 9% increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership.
The increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership was due to price changes and a shift in the plan mix towards higher priced plans, partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
We estimate that international revenues would have been approximately $94 million higher in the year ended December 31, 2018 if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with those for the year ended December 31, 2017.
If foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate more than expected, revenues and average revenue per paying membership may differ from our expectations.
The increase in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a $976 million increase in content amortization relating to our existing and new streaming content, including more exclusive and original programming.
Other costs increased $440 million primarily due to increases in expenses associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of streaming content, coupled with increases in payment processing fees and streaming delivery expenses, which were driven by our growing member base.International marketing expenses increased primarily due to increased advertising, driven by increased investments in marketing of new original titles.

 In the Domestic DVD segment, we derive revenues from our DVD-by-mail membership services.
We offer various DVD-by-mail plans that differ by the number of DVDs that a member may have out at any given point and access to high definition Blu-ray discs in addition to standard definition DVDs.
Cost of revenues in the Domestic DVD segment consist primarily of delivery expenses such as packaging and postage costs, content expenses, and other expenses associated with our DVD processing and customer service centers.
The number of memberships to our DVD-by-mail offering is declining, and we anticipate that this decline will continue.

The foreign exchange loss of $1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily driven by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies of our European and U.S. entities, mostly offset by the $74 million gain from remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros.Year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 Interest and other income (expense) decreased primarily due to foreign exchange losses.
In the year ended December 31, 2017, the foreign exchange loss of $128 million was primarily driven by the $141 million loss from remeasurement of our €1,300 million Senior Notes, partially offset by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than functional currencies of our European and U.S. entities.Provision for Income Taxes Year Ended December 31, Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 (in thousands, except percentages)Provision for (benefit from) income taxes $15,216 $(73,608) $73,829 $88,824 (121)% (147,437) (200)%Effective tax rate 1% (15)% 28%
 Year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 The increase in our effective tax rate is mainly due to lower benefit on a percentage basis from the recognition of excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation as well as additional expense related to foreign taxes, nondeductible expenses and the international provisions from the U.S. tax reform enacted in December 2017.
In 2018, the difference between our 1% effective tax rate and the Federal statutory rate of 21% was primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation, Federal and California research and development credits (“R&D”), and updated adjustments related to U.S. tax reform as a result of the U.S. federal tax return filing, partially offset by state taxes, foreign taxes, non-deductible expenses and the international provisions from the U.S. tax reform enacted in December 2017.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.
Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017.
In accordance with the Act, we recorded $79 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted.
The total expense included $32 million related to the transition tax and $47 million related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Additionally, Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118 ("SAB 118") was issued to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act.
December 22, 2018 marked the end of the measurement period for purposes of SAB 118.
As such, we have completed our analysis based on legislative updates relating to the Act currently available which resulted in an additional SAB 118 tax benefit of $34 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and a total tax benefit of $72 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The total tax provision benefit included $45 million related to adjustments to the transition tax and a $27 million benefit related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities.24Table of ContentsYear ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 At the beginning of 2017, we underwent a corporate restructuring that better aligns our corporate structure with how our business operates.
As a result of this restructuring and our increasing international income, there is now significantly more income being taxed at rates lower than the U.S. tax rate.The decrease in our effective tax rate is mainly due to the recognition of excess tax benefits attributable to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 and an increase in foreign income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate.
In 2017, the difference between our (15)% effective tax rate and the Federal statutory rate of 35% was $(244) million primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes, an increase in foreign income taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate and Federal and California research and development credits (“R&D”), partially offset by state taxes and non-deductible expenses as well as the provisional impact of changes to tax law.On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.
Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017.
We have calculated our best estimate of the impact of the Act in our year end income tax provision in accordance with our understanding of the Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing and as a result have recorded $79 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted.
The provisional amount related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, was $47 million.
The provisional amount related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was $32 million based on cumulative foreign earnings of $485 million.
We also recorded a $67 million benefit related to foreign taxes expensed in prior years that may now be claimed as a Foreign Tax Credit.
We have determined there is sufficient foreign source income projected to utilize these credits.25Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources

Long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs, increased $3,861 million due to long-term note issuances of $1,900 million in April 2018 and $800 million and €1,100 million in October 2018.
The earliest maturity date for our outstanding long-term debt is February 2021.
As of December 31, 2018, no amounts had been borrowed under our $500 million revolving credit facility.
See Note 4 Long-term Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.
We anticipate continuing to finance our future capital needs in the debt market, as we continue to believe that our after-tax cost of debt is lower than our cost of equity.
Our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing.
We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.
If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.
Our primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, streaming delivery, marketing programs and personnel-related costs.
Cash payment terms for non-original content have historically been in line with the amortization period.
Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content.
For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized.
We expect to continue to significantly increase our investments in global streaming content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity and result in future negative free cash flows for many years.
We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months.
Free Cash FlowWe define free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating and investing activities excluding the non-operational cash flows from purchases, maturities and sales of short-term investments.
We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content.
Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, cash flow used in operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.In assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash flow to net income, noting that the three major recurring differences are excess content payments over amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense and other working capital differences.
Working capital differences include deferred revenue, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt.
Our receivables from members generally settle quickly and deferred revenue is a source of cash flow.26Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in thousands)Net cash used in operating activities$(2,680,479) $(1,785,948) $(1,473,984)Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities(339,120) 34,329 49,765Net cash provided by financing activities4,048,527 3,076,990 1,091,630

The increased use of cash was primarily driven by the increase in investments in streaming content that require more upfront payments, partially offset by a $4,102 million or 35% increase in revenues.
The payments for streaming content assets increased $3,138 million, from $8,906 million to $12,044 million, or 35%, as compared to the increase in the amortization of streaming content assets of $1,334 million, from $6,198 million to $7,532 million, or 22%.
In addition, we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses, primarily related to increased headcount to support our continued improvements in our streaming service, our international expansion and increased content production activities.Net cash used in investing activities increased $373 million, primarily due to the decrease in proceeds from the sale of short-term investments, net of purchases, of $268 million.
In July 2017, the Company sold all short-term investments.
In addition, the cash used to purchase other assets increased $120 million primarily driven by the acquisition of intangible assets in the year ended December 31, 2018.Net cash provided by financing activities increased $972 million due to an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of debt of $938 million from $2,988 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 to $3,926 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.
In addition, we had an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $36 million.Non-GAAP free cash flow was $4,231 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to $4,512 million of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense and $40 million in other non-favorable working capital differences, partially offset by $321 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense.Year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 Net cash used in operating activities increased $312 million to $1,786 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The increased use of cash was primarily driven by the increase in investments in streaming content that require more upfront payments, partially offset by a $2,862 million or 32% increase in revenues.
The payments for streaming content assets increased $2,025 million, from $6,881 million to $8,906 million, or 29%, as compared to an increase in the amortization of streaming content assets of $1,409 million, from $4,788 million to $6,198 million, or 29%.
In addition, we had increased payments associated with higher operating expenses, primarily related to increased headcount costs to support our continued improvements in our streaming service, our international expansion and increased content production activities.
The increased use of cash was partially offset by a $2,862 million or 32% increase in revenues.Net cash provided by investing activities decreased $15 million, primarily due to a $66 million increase in the purchases of property and equipment, largely due to the expansion of our Los Gatos, California headquarters, as well as our new office space in Los Angeles, California.
This increase in cash used was partially offset by an increase of $33 million in the proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases due to the sale of our short-term investments in July 2017 as well as a decline in DVD purchases of $24 million.Net cash provided by financing activities increased $1,985 million due to an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of debt of $1,999 million from $989 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to $2,988 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.27Table of ContentsNon-GAAP free cash flow was $2,579 million lower than net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to $2,708 million of cash payments for streaming content assets over streaming amortization expense and $53 million of unfavorable other working capital differences, partially offset by $182 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense.Contractual ObligationsFor the purpose of this table, contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.
The expected timing of the payment of the obligations discussed below is estimated based on information available to us as of December 31, 2018.
Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2018: Payments due by PeriodContractual obligations (in thousands): Total Less than1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than5 yearsStreaming content obligations (1) $19,285,875 $8,611,398 $8,841,561 $1,684,582 $148,334Debt (2) 14,873,195 538,384 1,550,581 1,646,101 11,138,129Lease obligations (3) 1,708,368 172,470 284,541 307,727 943,630Other purchase obligations (4) 696,148 391,025 241,743 58,212 5,168Total $36,563,586 $9,713,277 $10,918,426 $3,696,622 $12,235,261 (1)As of December 31, 2018, streaming content obligations were comprised of $4.7 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $3.8 billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $10.8 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not then meet the criteria for recognition.Streaming content obligations increased $1.6 billion from $17.7 billion as of December 31, 2017 to $19.3 billion as of December 31, 2018 primarily due to multi-year commitments associated with the continued expansion of our exclusive and original programming.Streaming content obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of streaming content.
An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements and other production related commitments.
An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles.
Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date.
Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements.
The contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years.
However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $2 billion to $5 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months.
The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ.
Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.
(2)Long-term debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments.
See Note 4 Long-term Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.
(3)Lease obligations include lease financing obligations of $11 million related to certain of our Los Gatos, California corporate offices for which we are the deemed owner for accounting purposes, commitments of $1,157 million for our office space in Los Gatos, California and in Los Angeles, California and other commitments of $540 million for corporate and production facilities under non-cancelable operating leases.
These leases have expiration dates varying through approximately 2034.
Total lease obligations as of December 31, 2018 increased $971 million from $737 million 28Table of Contentsas of December 31, 2017 to $1,708 million as of December 31, 2018 due to growth in facilities to support our growing headcount and growing number of original productions.
(4)Other purchase obligations include all other non-cancelable contractual obligations.
These contracts are primarily related to streaming delivery and cloud computing costs, as well as other miscellaneous open purchase orders for which we have not received the related services or goods.As of December 31, 2018, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $48 million which was classified in “Other non-current liabilities” and a reduction to deferred tax assets which was classified as "Other non-current assets" in the consolidated balance sheets.
At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have transactions with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to us.
IndemnificationsThe information set forth under Note 6 Guarantees - Indemnification Obligations in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods.
The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments.
Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.Streaming Content We acquire, license and produce content, including original programing, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of TV series and films.
The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability.
Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense.
Payments for content, including additions to streaming assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within "Net cash used in operating activities" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.For licenses, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming.
The portion available for streaming within one year is recognized as “Current content assets, net” and the remaining portion as “Non-current content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
For productions, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development cost, direct costs and production overhead.
We include these amounts in "Non-current content assets, net" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs.
Based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability.
The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically expect more upfront viewing, for instance due to additional merchandising and marketing efforts, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization.
We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on an ongoing basis.
Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.29Table of ContentsOur business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level.
Therefore, content assets, both licensed and produced, are reviewed in aggregate at the operating segment level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content asset.
To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances.
If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost, net realizable value or fair value.
In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.
Income TaxesWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method.
Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain.
Although we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, and our forecast of future earnings, future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
The assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.
Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates.
However, we believe that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets will ultimately be realized.
We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized.
At December 31, 2018 the valuation allowance of $125 million was primarily related to foreign tax credits that we are not expected to realize.
We did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes.
We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement.
At December 31, 2018, our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were $48 million of which $44 million, if recognized, would favorably impact our future earnings.
Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.
Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017.
In accordance with the Act, we recorded $79 million as additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the legislation was enacted.
The total expense included $32 million related to the transition tax and $47 million related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Additionally, Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118 ("SAB 118") was issued to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act.
December 22, 2018 marked the end of the measurement period for purposes of SAB 118.
As such, we have completed our analysis based on legislative updates relating to the Act currently available which resulted in an additional SAB 118 tax benefit of $34 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and a total tax benefit of $72 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The total tax provision benefit included $45 million related to adjustments to the transition tax and a $27 million benefit related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities.See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.Recent Accounting PronouncementsThe information set forth under Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” is incorporated herein by reference.
30Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskWe are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currency fluctuations.
In July 2017, we sold all short-term investments.Interest Rate RiskAt December 31, 2018, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds, which are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.
As of December 31, 2018, we had $10.4 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in ten tranches due between 2021 and 2029.
Refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances.
The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest.
The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates, as discussed below.
Foreign Currency RiskInternational revenues and cost of revenues account for 49% and 58%, respectively, of consolidated amounts for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The majority of international revenues and a smaller portion of expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and we therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Japanese yen, the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real.Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and contribution profit (loss) of our International streaming segment as expressed in U.S. dollars.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, we believe our international revenues would have been approximately $94 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained consistent with those for the year ended December 31, 2017.We have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency.
In the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a $1 million foreign exchange loss due to the remeasurement of significant content liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies of our European and U.S. entities, mostly offset by the remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros.In addition, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents in the year ended December 31, 2018 was a decrease of $40 million.
We do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures.
The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy.
Our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations.Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary DataThe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes listed in Part IV, Item 15(a)(1) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are included immediately following Part IV hereof and incorporated by reference herein.Item 9.Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial DisclosureNone.31Table of ContentsItem 9A.Controls and Procedures(a)Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud.
A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Netflix have been detected.
(b)Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the Exchange Act)).
Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.
In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework).
Based on our assessment under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included herein.
(c)Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2018 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
32Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Netflix, Inc.Opinion on Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited Netflix, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
In our opinion, Netflix, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 and the related notes and our report dated January 29, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
