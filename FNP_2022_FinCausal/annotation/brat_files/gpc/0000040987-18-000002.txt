ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
OVERVIEWGenuine Parts Company is a service organization engaged in the distribution of automotive replacement parts, industrial parts and electrical materials and business products.
We have a long tradition of growth dating back to 1928, the year we were founded in Atlanta, Georgia.
The Company conducted business in 2017 throughout the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, the U.K., France, Germany, Poland and Puerto Rico from approximately 3,100 locations.
For the periods presented, the Company operates in four business segments: Automotive; Industrial; Business Products; and, Electrical and Electronic.
Effective in 2018, EIS, our Electrical and Electronic business segment, will be identified as the Electrical Specialties Group of Motion Industries, and will be included within the results of our Industrial business segment.
The combination of these two segments will provide strong economies of scale and greater operating efficiencies, which we intend to leverage.
The opportunity to build synergies by sharing talent, physical resources, greater size and scale, and value-added expertise in each respective market channel is highly compelling.
We anticipate this combination will create value for both our customers and all our stakeholders.We recorded consolidated net sales of $16.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 6.3% compared to sales in 2016.
Consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $617 million and diluted net income per share was $4.18.
Adjusted net income was $696 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and adjusted diluted net income per share was $4.71.
Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per share exclude the impact of transaction-related costs primarily related to the Company's acquisition of Alliance Automotive Group and the transition tax associated with foreign earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as required by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.In 2017, our growth strategy centered around positioning the Company for sustained long term sales and earnings growth.
We also executed on our initiatives to grow revenues and overcome the challenged sales environment in our U.S. automotive, business products and electrical/electronic businesses.
Additionally, we were focused on creating a lower cost, but highly effective infrastructure.
These efforts included steps to accelerate the integration of our acquisitions, investments to enhance our productivity and innovative strategies to offset rising costs.
Total sales in 2016 and 2015 were essentially flat relative to the prior year periods.
Net income in 2016 was down by 3% and decreased by 1% in 2015 when compared to the prior year.
Our revenue and earnings in 2016 reflected the impact of a challenging sales environment that persisted in the U.S. throughout the year.
In 2015, revenue and earnings reflected a 3% negative impact of currency translation and after adjusting for this factor, the Company produced an increase in both sales and net income.
Over the three year period of 2015 through 2017, our financial performance reflects a variety of initiatives the Company implemented to grow sales and earnings across our businesses.
Examples of such initiatives include strategic acquisitions, the introduction of new and expanded product lines, including those carried by acquired companies, geographic expansion, sales to new markets, enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross margin and cost savings initiatives.
We discuss these initiatives further below.With regard to the December 31, 2017 consolidated balance sheet, the Company’s cash balance of $315 million compares to cash of $243 million at December 31, 2016.
The Company continues to maintain a strong cash position, supported by relatively steady net income and effective asset management.
Accounts receivable increased 25% from the prior year and is up 3% excluding the AAG and other recent acquisitions as well as the impact of foreign currency.
The 3% increase compares to an approximate 4.5% sales increase in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Inventory is up by approximately 17%, including the impact of acquisitions, and is relatively unchanged excluding the AAG and other recent acquisitions as well as the impact of foreign currency.
Accounts payable increased 18% from the prior year, and is up 3% excluding the AAG and other recent acquisitions as well as the impact of foreign currency.
The slight increase in accounts payable before these items reflects improved payment terms with certain suppliers offset by the decrease in purchases in the fourth quarter of the year.
Total debt outstanding at December 31, 2017 was $3.2 billion, an increase from total debt of $875 million at December 31, 2016, which is related to the acquisition of AAG.19Index to Financial StatementsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSOur results of operations are summarized below for the three years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (In thousands except per share data)Net sales$16,308,801 $15,339,713 $15,280,044Gross margin4,906,398 4,599,607 4,555,852Net income616,757 687,240 705,672Diluted net income per common share4.18 4.59 4.63Net SalesConsolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $16.3 billion, up 6.3% from 2016.
2017 net sales included a 4.4% contribution from acquisitions, net of store closures, an approximate 1.5% increase in core sales and an approximate 0.4% positive impact of currency translation.
Core sales growth, which represents the Company's comparable sales, included an approximate 0.6% increase in sales volume and product inflation of approximately 0.9%.
The impact of product inflation varied by business in 2017, as prices were up approximately 0.3% in the Automotive segment, up approximately 2.0% in the Industrial segment, up approximately 1.3% in the Electrical/Electronic segment and up approximately 0.6% in the Business Products segment.
Due to the Company's global initiatives to grow revenues and create a lower cost, but highly effective infrastructure, it is well positioned for sustainable long-term growth.Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $15.3 billion, up slightly from 2015.
2016 net sales included a 2.4% contribution from acquisitions, net of store closures, offset by a 1.1% decrease in core sales and an approximate 0.5% negative impact of currency translation.
Additionally, the Company experienced product deflation of approximately 0.3%.
The impact of product inflation/deflation varied by business in 2016 and, cumulatively, prices were down approximately 0.7% in the Automotive segment, up approximately 0.4% in the Industrial segment, up approximately 0.3% in the Business Products segment and down approximately 1.2% in the Electrical/Electronic segment.
Automotive GroupNet sales for the Automotive Group (“Automotive”) were $8.7 billion in 2017, a 7% increase from 2016.
The increase in sales for the year consists of an approximate 5% contribution from acquisitions, a 1% comparable sales increase and an approximate 1% positive impact of currency translation associated with our automotive businesses in Canada, Australasia and Mexico.
Automotive sales were also positively impacted by product inflation of 0.3%, which is included in the comparable sales increase.
In 2017, total Automotive revenues were up 3% in the first quarter, up 4% in the second and third quarters and up 17% in the fourth quarter.
The significant increase in fourth quarter sales relative to the first three quarters of 2017 primarily reflects the incremental revenues from the Alliance Automotive Group acquisition on November 2, 2017.
Throughout 2017, the sales environment for the automotive aftermarket was stronger in our international markets of Canada, Australasia and Mexico than in the United States.
In our view, however, the underlying fundamentals in the automotive aftermarket, including the overall number and age of the vehicle population as well as the positive increase in miles driven, remain supportive of sustained demand for automotive aftermarket maintenance and supply items across the markets we serve.
We expect these fundamentals as well as key sales initiatives to drive sales growth for the Automotive business in 2018.Net sales for the Automotive Group were $8.1 billion in 2016, a 1% increase from 2015.
The increase in sales for the year consists of an approximate 1% comparable sales increase and a 1% contribution from acquisitions, less an approximate 1% negative impact of currency translation associated with our automotive businesses in Canada, Australasia and Mexico.
Automotive sales were negatively impacted by product deflation of 0.7%, which is included in the comparable sales increase.
In 2016, Automotive revenues were up 2% in the first quarter, down 1% in the second quarter, up 1.5% in the third quarter and up 2% in the fourth quarter.
Industrial GroupNet sales for Motion Industries, our Industrial Group (“Industrial”), were $5.0 billion in 2017, up 7.2% from 2016.
The increase in sales for the year reflects an approximate 4.4% comparable sales increase, a 2.6% contribution from acquisitions and a slight positive impact of currency translation associated with our Canadian and Mexican operations.
Motion's sales were also positively impacted by product inflation of 2.0%, as a portion of this increase is passed through to customers and included in the comparable sales increase.
Industrial revenues were up 7% in each of the four quarters in 2017, which correlates to the ongoing strength in the industrial economy throughout the year.
This was evidenced by positive economic indicators such as Manufacturing Industrial Production, the Purchasing Managers Index, the level of exports and the continued stabilization of the energy sector.
We believe the Industrial business is well positioned for ongoing profitable growth in 2018.20Index to Financial StatementsNet sales for Industrial were $4.6 billion in 2016, basically unchanged from 2015.
An approximate 2.6% decrease in sales volumes and a slight negative impact of currency translation associated with our Canadian and Mexican operations were partially offset by higher transaction values associated with 0.4% product inflation and approximately 2% in sales from acquisitions.
Industrial revenues were down 2.5% in the first quarter of 2016, down 2% in the second quarter, down 1% in the third quarter and up 4% in the fourth quarter.
The sequential improvement in this group's sales performance correlated to the growing strength in the industrial economy during the year.
In addition, the energy sector, which had contracted throughout 2015 and the first half of 2016, began to stabilize over the last half of 2016. Business Products GroupNet sales for S. P. Richards, our Business Products Group (“Business Products”), were $2.0 billion in 2017, an increase of 1.5% from 2016.
The increase in sales reflects a 4.8% contribution from acquisitions, offset by an approximate 3.3% decrease in comparable sales, inclusive of a 0.6% increase in higher transaction values associated with price inflation.
Sales were up 9% in the first quarter, up 5% in the second quarter, down 5% in the third quarter and down 2% in the fourth quarter of 2017.
While the business products industry continues to face significant challenges, our strategy to diversify our traditional product offering into the large and growing Facilities, Breakroom and Safety Supplies (FBS) category has proven beneficial.
Looking ahead, we remain focused on our core growth initiatives and the further diversification of this business, but will continue to evaluate all opportunities that may help us more effectively navigate the difficult industry dynamics in which we compete.Net sales for Business Products were $2.0 billion in 2016, an increase of 2% from 2015.
The increase in sales reflects an approximate 7% contribution from acquisitions and a 0.3% increase in higher transaction values associated with price inflation.
These items were offset by an approximate 6% decrease in sales volume.
Sales were down 3% in the first quarter, up 1% in the second quarter, up 5% in the third quarter and up 4% in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Overall, this growth was driven by our strategy to further diversify the Business Products business in the FBS category.
Electrical/Electronic GroupNet sales for EIS, our Electrical and Electronic Group (“Electrical/Electronic”), were $781 million in 2017, an increase of 9.1% from 2016.
The increase in sales consists of an 8.3% contribution from acquisitions and an approximate 1% benefit from copper pricing, which were partially offset by a slight decline in comparable sales for the year.
Sales were also positively impacted by product inflation of 1.3%, which is included in comparable sales.
Sales for Electrical/Electronic increased by 5% in the first quarter, 11% in the second quarter, 12% in the third quarter and 9% in the fourth quarter, relative to the prior year periods.
These quarterly sales increases primarily reflect the benefit of acquisitions.Net sales for Electrical/Electronic were $716 million in 2016, a decrease of 5% from 2015.
The decrease in sales consists of an approximate 4% decline in sales volume, a 1.2% decrease from lower transaction values associated with price deflation and a 0.5% negative sales impact of copper pricing.
These items were partially offset by an approximate 1% contribution from acquisitions.
Sales for Electrical/Electronic decreased by 3% in the first quarter, 5% in the second quarter, 9% in the third quarter and were unchanged in the fourth quarter, relative to the prior year periods.
The manufacturing segment of the economy was relatively weak in 2016, which pressured demand across the markets served by this business.Cost of Goods SoldThe Company includes in cost of goods sold the actual cost of merchandise, which represents the vast majority of this line item.
Other items in cost of goods sold include warranty costs and in-bound freight from the suppliers, net of any vendor allowances and incentives.
Cost of goods sold was $11.40 billion in 2017, $10.74 billion in 2016 and $10.72 billion in 2015.
Cost of goods sold in 2017 and 2016 changed from the prior year periods in accordance with the related percentage change in sales for the same periods.
In addition, the Company incurred costs of $49.1 million primarily related to the Alliance Automotive Group acquisition, of which $5.6 million was recorded to cost of goods sold in 2017.
For these periods, total product inflation or deflation was less than 1% and actual costs were relatively unchanged from the prior year.
Cost of goods sold represented 69.9% of net sales in 2017, 70.0% of net sales in 2016 and 70.2% of net sales in 2015 thus, as a percent of net sales, decreased slightly in 2017 and 2016.In 2017, each of the Company's business segments experienced vendor price increases, while in 2016 and 2015, only the Industrial and Business Products segments experienced vendor price increases.
In any year where we experience price increases, we are able to work with our customers to pass most of these along to them.Operating ExpensesThe Company includes in selling, administrative and other expenses (“SG&A”), all personnel and personnel-related costs at its headquarters, distribution centers, stores and branches, which accounts for approximately 65% of total SG&A.
Additional costs in SG&A include our facilities, delivery, marketing, advertising, technology, digital, legal and professional costs.21Index to Financial StatementsSG&A of $3.71 billion in 2017 increased by $334 million or approximately 10% from 2016.
This represents 22.7% of net sales compared to 22.0% of net sales in 2016.
The increase in SG&A expenses from the prior year reflect a combination of factors, including the impact of increased sales for the year.
We also experienced rising costs in areas such as labor, freight, technology, warehousing, insurance, healthcare and other employee benefits.
Further, we incurred incremental costs associated with our 15 acquisitions during the year and, in addition, recorded $43.5 million in transaction-related costs primarily associated with the acquisition of Alliance Automotive Group.
Finally, our SG&A expenses reflect the impact of higher cost, and higher gross margin, models at select acquisitions, including Alliance Automotive Group.
The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales from the prior year reflect the increases in costs described above as well as the loss of leverage associated with the Company's 1.5% consolidated comparable sales growth.
To improve on our SG&A expense levels, we continue to work towards a lower cost, but highly effective infrastructure.
These efforts include steps to accelerate the integration of our acquisitions, investments to enhance our productivity and innovative strategies to unlock greater savings and efficiencies.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $168 million in 2017, an increase of approximately $20 million or 14% from 2016, due primarily to the impact of acquisitions.
The provision for doubtful accounts was $14 million in 2017, a $2 million increase from 2016.
We believe the Company is adequately reserved for bad debts at December 31, 2017.SG&A of $3.37 billion in 2016 increased by $93 million or approximately 3% from 2015.
This represents 22.0% of net sales compared to 21.4% of net sales in 2015.
The increase in SG&A expenses from the prior year reflects the year one costs associated with our 19 acquisitions, as well as the impact of higher cost, and higher gross margin, models at select acquisitions.
The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales from the prior year reflect the loss of leverage due to negative comparable sales in our U.S.
Automotive, Industrial, Business Products and Electrical/Electronic businesses.
Depreciation and amortization expense was $147 million in 2016, an increase of approximately $6 million or 4% from 2015.
The provision for doubtful accounts was $12 million in 2016, a decrease of $1 million from 2015.
Total share-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $16.9 million, $19.7 million and $17.7 million, respectively.
Refer to Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding share-based compensation.Non-Operating Expenses and IncomeNon-operating expenses consist primarily of interest.
Interest expense was $41 million in 2017, $21 million in 2016 and $22 million in 2015.
The $20 million increase in interest expense in 2017 reflects the combination of higher debt levels throughout the year and rising interest rates on certain variable interest debt instruments.
In addition, the Company further increased its debt levels with the acquisition of Alliance Automotive Group on November 2, 2017.
The $1 million decrease in interest expense in 2016 compared to 2015 reflects the more favorable interest rate on certain debt, which was renewed in November 2016.
This was partially offset by new long-term debt, which commenced in July 2016.In “Other”, the net benefit of interest income, equity method investment income, investment dividends and noncontrolling interests in 2017 was $31 million, a $5 million increase from the prior year.
The increase in Other reflects the incremental investment income associated with the Company's April 2017 Inenco investment as well as higher interest income earned in 2017 relative to 2016.
These items totaled $26 million in 2016, an increase from $21 million in 2015 due to higher interest income earned in 2016 relative to 2015.
Income Before Income TaxesIncome before income taxes was $1.0 billion in 2017, down 6% from 2016.
As a percentage of net sales, income before income taxes was 6.2% in 2017 compared to 7.0% in 2016.
Adjusted for $49.1 million in transaction-related costs primarily associated with the Company's acquisition of Alliance Automotive Group on November 2, 2017, income before income taxes was down 1% from 2016 and 6.5% of net sales.
In 2016, income before income taxes was $1.1 billion, down 4% from 2015 and as a percentage of net sales was 7.0% compared to 7.4% in 2015.Automotive GroupAutomotive income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales, which we refer to as operating margin, decreased to 8.3% in 2017 from 8.8% in 2016.
The decrease in margin reflects the loss of expense leverage due to 1% growth in comparable sales for Automotive, as this group requires approximately 3% comparable sales growth to leverage its fixed costs.
In addition, rising costs in several areas negatively impacted Automotive's margin.
To improve Automotive's operating margin, this group is focused on several initiatives to grow sales and has also enhanced its cost management initiatives to drive savings in 2018 and the years ahead.Automotive’s operating margin of 8.8% in 2016 was down from 9.1% in 2015 due to the loss of expense leverage on weak comparable sales in the U.S. 22Index to Financial StatementsIndustrial GroupIndustrial’s operating margin was 7.7% in 2017, which is up from 7.3% in 2016.
The improvement in operating margin for this group primarily reflects the positive impact of stronger sales growth in 2017 relative to 2016, driven by an improved industrial economy.
Gross margins benefited from the increase in supplier incentives and rebates and operating expenses were better leveraged.
Industrial enters 2018 in position to further expand their operating margin.
Industrial’s operating margin was 7.3% in 2016, which was unchanged from 2015.
The constant margin primarily reflects improved gross margins and cost savings associated with initiatives to consolidate locations during 2016, which were partially offset by continued pressure on operating expenses associated with the decrease in comparable sales for the year.Business Products GroupBusiness Product's operating margin decreased to 4.9% in 2017 from 5.9% in 2016, as gross margin pressures associated with lower supplier incentives as well as rising costs and the deleveraging of expenses due to comparable sales declines in this group's core office supplies business continue to weigh on the operating margin for this business.
The Business Products Group enters 2018 focused on its core growth initiatives, the further diversification of its business and the evaluation of options for new and enhanced opportunities that may serve to more effectively navigate the difficult industry dynamics in which we compete.Business Product's operating margin decreased to 5.9% in 2016 from 7.3% in 2015, primarily due to gross margin pressures associated with lower supplier incentives and the deleveraging of expenses due to comparable sales declines in the core office supplies business.Electrical/Electronic GroupElectrical/Electronic’s operating margin was 7.2% in 2017, a decrease from 8.5% in 2016, as changes in product mix pressured gross margins and operating expenses were deleveraged due to the slight decline in comparable sales for the year.
We expect further cost savings in 2018, as this group combines with the Industrial Parts Group.
Electrical/Electronic’s operating margin decreased to 8.5% in 2016 from 9.3% in 2015, primarily due to changes in product mix that pressured gross margins as well as deleveraging of operating expenses due to lower comparable sales from the previous year.
These items were partially offset by cost savings initiatives to consolidate locations.Income TaxesThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted December 22, 2017.
While not all inclusive, these are the provisions of the Act that materially impact the Company.
It reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for taxable years starting after December 31, 2017, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were not previously subject to U.S. Federal income tax and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings.The effective income tax rate of 38.9% in 2017 increased from 36.0% in 2016.
The increase in rate reflects the $51 million tax expense related to the transition tax associated with foreign earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as required by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
Excluding this one-time tax expense, our adjusted 2017 income tax rate would have been 33.8%, which reflects a favorable mix of U.S. and foreign earnings, including Alliance Automotive Group acquired November 2, 2017.The effective income tax rate of 36.0% in 2016 decreased from 37.2% in 2015.
The decrease in rate primarily reflects the Company's lower mix of U.S. earnings in 2016, which is taxed at a higher rate relative to our foreign operations.
Additionally, the more favorable retirement asset valuation adjustment in 2016 relative to 2015 resulted in the decrease in rate.
Net IncomeNet income was $617 million in 2017, a decrease of 10.3% from $687 million in 2016.
On a per share diluted basis, net income was $4.18 in 2017, down 8.9% compared to $4.59 in 2016.
Net income was 3.8% of net sales in 2017 compared to 4.5% of net sales in 2016.
Adjusted net income was $696 million in 2017, up 1.2% from 2016, and on a per share diluted basis, adjusted net income was $4.71, a 2.6% increase compared to $4.59 in in 2016.
Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per share exclude the impact of transaction related costs primarily related to the Company's acquisition of Alliance Automotive Group and the one-time transition tax associated with foreign earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as required by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.Net income was $687 million in 2016, a decrease of 3% from $706 million in 2015.
On a per share diluted basis, net income was $4.59 in 2016, down 1% compared to $4.63 in 2015.
Net income was 4.5% of net sales in 2016 compared to 4.6% of net sales in 2015.23Index to Financial StatementsFINANCIAL CONDITIONThe Company’s cash balance of $315 million at December 31, 2017 compares to cash of $243 million at December 31, 2016, as discussed further below.
Accounts receivable at December 31, 2017 increased by approximately 25% from the prior year, and is up 3% excluding the AAG and other recent acquisitions as well as the impact of foreign currency.
The 3% increase compares to an approximate 4.5% sales increase in the fourth quarter of 2017.
We are satisfied with the quality and collectibility of our accounts receivable.
Inventory at December 31, 2017 increased from the prior year by approximately 17%, and is relatively unchanged excluding the AAG and other recent acquisitions as well as the impact of foreign currency.
Accounts payable increased 18% from the prior year, and is up 3% excluding the AAG and other recent acquisitions as well as the impact of foreign currency.
The slight increase in accounts payable before these items reflects improved payment terms with certain suppliers offset by the decrease in purchases in the fourth quarter of the year.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe Company’s sources of capital consist primarily of cash flows from operations, supplemented as necessary by private issuances of debt and bank borrowings.
We have $3.25 billion of total debt outstanding at December 31, 2017, of which $50 million matures in July 2021, $250 million matures in December 2023, €225 million matures on October 30, 2024, $250 million matures in November 2026, €250 million matures on October 30, 2027, $120 million matures on October 30, 2027, €125 million matures on October 30, 2029 and €100 million matures on October 30, 2032.
In addition, the Company has a multi-currency Syndicated Facility Agreement (the "Syndicated Facility") with a consortium of financial institutions.
The Syndicated Facility includes a $1.5 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility and a $1.1 billion Term Loan A, of which the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan A have $590 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, outstanding at December 31, 2017.
Currently, we believe that our cash on hand and available short-term and long-term sources of capital are sufficient to fund the Company’s operations, including working capital requirements, scheduled debt payments, interest payments, capital expenditures, benefit plan contributions, income tax obligations, dividends, share repurchases and contemplated acquisitions.The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.3 to 1 and 1.4 to 1 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and our liquidity position remains solid.
The Company’s total debt outstanding at December 31, 2017 increased by $2.4 billion or 270% from December 31, 2016, due primarily to the 15 acquisitions made in 2017.Sources and Uses of Net CashA summary of the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows: Year Ended December 31, Percent ChangeNet Cash Provided by (Used in):2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 (In thousands)
Operating activities$815,043 $946,078 $1,159,373 (14)% (18)%Investing activities(1,630,280) (593,999) (263,627) 174 % 125 %Financing activities872,059 (322,406) (806,074) 370 % (60)%Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities:The Company continues to generate cash, and in 2017, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $815 million.
This reflects a $131 million or 14% decrease from 2016, and represents the lower source of cash from trade accounts receivable, merchandise inventories, trade accounts payable and other short term assets and liabilities, collectively, relative to 2016.
Other changes in operating activities were essentially offsetting.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $946 million in 2016, an 18% decrease from 2015 due primarily to the change in trade accounts receivable, merchandise inventories, and trade accounts payable, which, collectively, net to a $123 million source of cash in 2016 compared to a $312 million source of cash in 2015.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities:Net cash flow used in investing activities was $1.63 billion in 2017 compared to $594 million in 2016, a $1.04 billion or 174% increase.
Cash used for acquisitions of businesses and other investing activities in 2017 was $1.49 billion, or $1.03 billion more than in 2016.
Primarily, this increase reflects the Company's purchase of Alliance Automotive Group.
Capital expenditures of $157 million in 2017 compare to $161 million in 2016 and were within the range of our original estimate of $145 to $165 million for the year.
We estimate that cash used for capital expenditures in 2018 will be approximately $200 to $220 million.
24Index to Financial StatementsNet cash flow used in investing activities was $594 million in 2016 compared to $264 million in 2015, an increase of 125%.
Cash used for acquisitions of businesses and other investing activities in 2016 was $462 million, or $299 million more than in 2015.
Capital expenditures of $161 million in 2016 were $51 million more than in 2015, which was at the high end of our original estimate of $140 to $160 million for the year.
Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities: Net cash provided by financing activities in 2017 totaled $872 million, an increase of $1.19 billion or 370% from the $322 million used in financing activities in 2016.
Primarily, the increase reflects additional borrowings associated with the Company's purchase of AAG.
Cash used in financing activities in 2016 was down 60% from the $806 million used in 2015.
For the three years presented, the Company's financing activities included the use of cash for dividends paid to shareholders and repurchases of the Company’s common stock.
The Company paid dividends to shareholders of $395 million, $387 million and $368 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The Company expects this trend of increasing dividends to continue in the foreseeable future.
During 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company repurchased $174 million, $181 million and $292 million, respectively, of the Company’s common stock.
We expect to remain active in our share repurchase program, but the amount and value of shares repurchased will vary.
In 2016, net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by approximately $250 million in net proceeds from debt.Notes and Other BorrowingsThe Company maintains a $2.6 billion syndicated credit facility with a consortium of financial institutions, which matures in June 2022 with an option to decrease the borrowing capacity or terminate the Syndicated Facility with appropriate notice and bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the Company’s debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) ratio (2.69% at December 31, 2017).
The Company also has the option to increase the borrowing capacity up to an additional $1 billion, as well as an option to decrease the borrowing capacity or terminate the facility with appropriate notice.
At December 31, 2017, approximately $1.7 billion were outstanding under this line of credit.
Due to the workers’ compensation and insurance reserve requirements in certain states, the Company also had unused letters of credit of approximately $62 million and $65 million outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.At December 31, 2017, the Company had unsecured Senior Notes outstanding under financing arrangement as follows: $50 million series G senior unsecured notes, 2.39% fixed, due 2021; $250 million series F senior unsecured notes, 2.99% fixed, due 2023; €225 million series J senior unsecured notes, 1.4% fixed, maturing on October 30, 2024; $250 million series H senior unsecured notes, 2.99% fixed, due 2026; €250 million series K senior unsecured notes, 1.81% fixed, maturing on October 30, 2027; $120 million series I senior unsecured notes, 3.70% fixed, maturing on October 30, 2027; €125 million series L senior unsecured notes, 2.02% fixed, maturing on October 30, 2029; and €100 million series M senior unsecured notes, 2.32% fixed, maturing on October 30, 2032.
These borrowings contain covenants related to a maximum debt to EBITDA ratio and certain limitations on additional borrowings.
At December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants.
The weighted average interest rate on the Company’s total outstanding borrowings was approximately 2.70% at December 31, 2017 and 2.39% at December 31, 2016.
Total interest expense, net of interest income, for all borrowings was $38.7 million, $19.5 million and $20.4 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.Contractual and Other ObligationsThe following table shows the Company’s approximate obligations and commitments, including interest due on credit facilities, to make future payments under specified contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:Contractual Obligations Payment Due by Period Total Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Over5 Years (In thousands)Credit facilities$3,522,700 $681,800 $266,100 $974,200 $1,600,600Operating leases1,140,000 299,200 406,900 196,300 237,600Total contractual cash obligations$4,662,700 $981,000 $673,000 $1,170,500 $1,838,200Due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2017, the Company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities.
Therefore, $17 million of unrecognized tax benefits and the provisional $37 million one-time transition tax estimate related to the Act have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
Refer to Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on income taxes.25Index to Financial StatementsPurchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates.
We are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.
Our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons.
The Company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements.The Company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores (independents) and certain other affiliates in which the Company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest (affiliates).
The Company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to the Company’s guarantee.
To date, the Company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents’ and affiliates’ borrowings.
The following table shows the Company’s approximate commercial commitments as of December 31, 2017:Other Commercial Commitments Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period Total AmountsCommitted Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Over5 Years (In thousands)Line of credit$— $— $— $— $—Standby letters of credit62,019 62,019 — — —Guaranteed borrowings of independents and affiliates616,710 220,364 390,144 6,202 —Total commercial commitments$678,729 $282,383 $390,144 $6,202 $—In addition, the Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time.
Contributions in 2017 were $53 million.
We expect to make $47 million in cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit plans in 2018, and contributions required for 2018 and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans’ assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans’ obligations.Share RepurchasesIn 2017, the Company repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares and the Company had remaining authority to purchase approximately 17.4 million shares at December 31, 2017.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESGeneralManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates, assumptions and judgments.
An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements.
Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
For further information on the critical accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.Inventories — Provisions for Slow Moving and ObsolescenceThe Company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate provisions related thereto.
Historically, these losses have not been significant as the vast majority of the Company’s inventories are not highly susceptible 26Index to Financial Statementsto obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs.
While the Company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future, its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur.Allowance for Doubtful Accounts — MethodologyThe Company evaluates the collectability of trade accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.
The Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience and periodically adjusts this estimate when the Company becomes aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filing) or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable.
While the Company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed, a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the Company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and, therefore, the need to revise estimates for bad debts.
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of approximately $13.9 million, $11.5 million, and $12.4 million, respectively.Consideration Received from VendorsThe Company may enter into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives.
Generally, the Company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria.
The Company accrues for the receipt of these incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year.
While management believes the Company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in 2018 and beyond, there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future or that we will be able to achieve the specified volumes necessary to take advantage of such incentives.Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsAt least annually, the Company evaluates property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators.
The Company’s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance, among other factors.
Future events could cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired.
Evaluating for impairment also requires the Company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which require judgment by management.
Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.Employee Benefit PlansThe Company’s benefit plan committees in the U.S. and Canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the Company’s pension plan assets.
The plans in Europe are unfunded and therefore there are no plan assets.
The pension plan investment strategy implemented by the Company’s management is to achieve long-term objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the U.S. and Canada, as well as fiduciary standards.
The long-term primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital without undue exposure to risk, protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plans’ actuarially assumed long term rates of return.
The Company’s investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark (47% S&P 500 Index, 5% Russell Mid Cap Index, 7% Russell 2000 Index, 5% MSCI EAFE Index, 5% DJ Global Moderate Index, 3% MSCI Emerging Market Net, and 28% BarCap U.S. Govt/Credit).We make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan assets and liabilities and related pension income.
We believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate.
Other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases, mortality rates, retirement patterns and turnover rates.
Refer to Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding these assumptions.Based on the investment policy for the pension plans, as well as an asset study that was performed based on the Company’s asset allocations and future expectations, the Company’s expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring 2018 pension income is 7.20% for the plans.
The asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the Company’s benefit obligations, using capital market data and historical relationships.The discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date.
We have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of high-quality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate.
Based upon this cash flow matching analysis, we selected a weighted average discount rate for the plans of 3.70% at December 31, 2017.27Index to Financial StatementsNet periodic benefit income for our defined benefit pension plans was $12.6 million, $13.4 million, and $5.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The income associated with the pension plans in 2017, 2016 and 2015 reflects the impact of the hard freeze effective December 31, 2013.
Refer to Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans.Business CombinationsFrom time to time, the Company may enter into business combinations.
The Company generally recognizes the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition.
The Company measures goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred, which the Company also measures at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
The acquisition method of accounting requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, liabilities, including those related to debt, pensions and other postretirement plans, uncertain tax positions, contingent consideration and contingencies.
This method also requires the Company to refine these estimates over a measurement period not to exceed one year to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date.
If the Company is required to adjust provisional amounts that it has recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could have a material impact on the its financial condition and results of operations.Significant estimates and assumptions in estimating the fair value of acquired customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that the Company expects to generate from the acquired assets.
If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, the Company could record impairment charges.
In addition, the Company has estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense.
If the Company's estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be increased or decreased, or the acquired asset could be impaired.QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: Three Months Ended March 31, June 30, Sept. 30, Dec. 31, (In thousands except per share data)2017

As a result, the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per share will not necessarily total the annual basic and diluted earnings per share.The preparation of interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements.
Specifically, the Company makes estimates 28Index to Financial Statementsand assumptions in its interim condensed consolidated financial statements for inventory adjustments, the accrual of bad debts, the accrual of insurance reserves, customer sales returns and volume incentives earned, among others.
Inventory adjustments (including adjustments for a majority of inventories that are valued under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method) are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual book to physical inventory adjustment and LIFO valuation, which is performed each year-end.
Reserves for bad debts, insurance and customer sales returns are estimated and accrued on an interim basis based upon historical experience.
Volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing levels.
Income taxes are estimated on an interim basis to reflect the impact of tax reform assumptions and other considerations.
The estimates and assumptions for interim reporting may change upon final determination at year-end, and such changes may be significant.
The effect of these adjustments in 2017 and 2016 was not significant.ITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
Although the Company does not face material risks related to interest rates and commodity prices, the Company is exposed to changes in foreign currency rates with respect to foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses.Foreign CurrencyThe Company has translation gains or losses that result from translation of the results of operations of an operating unit’s foreign functional currency into U.S. dollars for consolidated financial statement purposes.
For the periods presented, the Company’s principal foreign currency exchange exposure is the Canadian dollar, the functional currency of our Canadian operations, the Australian dollar, the functional currency of our Australasian operations and, to a lesser extent, the Mexican peso, the functional currency of our Mexican operations.
Effective in November 2017, the Company increased its foreign currency exchange exposure to include the Euro, the functional currency of our European operations.
Foreign currency exchange exposure, particularly in regard to the Canadian and Australian dollar and, to a lesser extent, the Euro and Mexican peso, positively impacted our results for the year ended December 31, 2017.During 2017 and 2016, it was estimated that a 10% shift in exchange rates between those foreign functional currencies and the U.S. dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately $287 million and $262 million, respectively.
A 15% shift in exchange rates between those functional currencies and the U.S. dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately $430 million in 2017 and $393 million in 2016.
A 20% shift in exchange rates between those functional currencies and the U.S. dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately $574 million in 2017 and $524 million in 2016.
