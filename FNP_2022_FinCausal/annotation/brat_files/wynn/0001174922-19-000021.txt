Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The results presented reflect the Company's adoption of the new accounting guidance for revenue recognition ("ASC 606"), effective January 1, 2018.
Certain prior period amounts have been adjusted to reflect the full retrospective adoption of ASC 606, with no impact to operating income, net income or Adjusted Property EBITDA.OverviewWe are a developer, owner and operator of destination casino resorts (integrated resorts).
In Macau, we own approximately 72% of WML, which includes the operations of the Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau resorts.
In Las Vegas, Nevada, we operate and, with the exception of certain retail space, own 100% of Wynn Las Vegas.
We are currently constructing Encore Boston Harbor, an integrated casino resort in Everett, Massachusetts.Key Operating MeasuresCertain key operating measures specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussion of our operational performance for the periods for which the Consolidated Statements of Income are presented.
These key operating measures are defined below:•Table drop in mass market for our Macau Operations is the amount of cash that is deposited in a gaming table's drop box plus cash chips purchased at the casino cage.
•Table drop for our Las Vegas Operations is the amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming table's drop box.•Rolling chips are non-negotiable identifiable chips that are used to track turnover for purposes of calculating incentives within our Macau Operations' VIP program.•Turnover is the sum of all losing rolling chip wagers within our Macau Operations' VIP program.
•Table games win is the amount of table drop or turnover that is retained and recorded as casino revenues.
Table games win is before discounts, commissions and the allocation of casino revenues to rooms, food and beverage and other revenues for services provided to casino customers on a complimentary basis.
•Slot machine win is the amount of handle (representing the total amount wagered) that is retained by us and is recorded as casino revenues.
Slot machine win is after adjustment for progressive accruals and free play, but before discounts and the allocation of casino revenues to rooms, food and beverage and other revenues for services provided to casino customers on a complimentary basis.•Average daily rate ("ADR") is calculated by dividing total room revenues, including complimentaries (less service charges, if any), by total rooms occupied.
•Revenue per available room ("REVPAR") is calculated by dividing total room revenues, including complimentaries (less service charges, if any), by total rooms available.
•Occupancy is calculated by dividing total occupied rooms, including complimentary rooms, by the total rooms available.
Below is a discussion of the methodologies used to calculate win percentages at our resorts.In our VIP operations in Macau, customers primarily purchase rolling chips from the casino cage and can only use them to make wagers.
Winning wagers are paid in cash chips.
The loss of the rolling chips in the VIP operations is recorded as turnover and provides a base for calculating VIP win percentage.
It is customary in Macau to measure VIP play using this rolling chip method.
We expect our win as a percentage of turnover from these operations to be within the range of 2.7% to 3.0%.
In our mass market operations in Macau, customers may purchase cash chips at either the gaming tables or at the casino cage.
The measurements from our VIP and mass market operations are not comparable as the measurement method used in our mass market operations tracks the initial purchase of chips at the table and at the casino cage, while the measurement method from our VIP operations tracks the sum of all losing wagers.
Accordingly, the base measurement from the VIP operations is much larger than the base measurement from the mass market operations.
As a result, the expected win percentage with the same amount of gaming win is lower in the VIP operations when compared to the mass market operations.
In Las Vegas, customers purchase chips at the gaming tables.
The cash and net markers used to purchase chips are deposited in the gaming table's drop box.
This is the base of measurement that we use for calculating win percentage in Las Vegas.
Each type of table game has its own theoretical win percentage.
Our expected table games win percentage in Las Vegas is 22% to 26%.37 Table of ContentsResults of OperationsSummary annual resultsThe following table summarizes our financial results for the periods presented (in thousands, except per share data): Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016Operating revenues$6,717,660 $6,070,160 $4,345,797Net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited572,430 747,181 241,975Diluted net income per share5.35 7.28 2.38Adjusted Property EBITDA (1)2,044,413 1,810,732 1,259,327(1) See Item 8—"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data," Note 16, "Segment Information," for a reconciliation of Adjusted Property EBITDA to net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited.For the year ended December 31, 2018, net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited was $572.4 million, or $5.35 per diluted share, a decrease of 23.4%, or $174.8 million, compared to $747.2 million, or $7.28 per diluted share, for the same period of 2017.
The decrease in net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited was primarily the result of a litigation settlement expense of $463.6 million, partially offset by an increase in operating income from Wynn Palace.
Results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 results included net tax benefits of $390.9 million and $339.9 million, respectively, recorded in connection with U.S. tax reform.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, Adjusted Property EBITDA was $2.04 billion, an increase of 12.9%, or $233.7 million, from $1.81 billion for the same period of 2017.
The increase in Adjusted Property EBITDA was the result of an increase of $316.3 million from Wynn Palace, partially offset by decreases of $27.5 million and $55.1 million from Wynn Macau and our Las Vegas Operations, respectively.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited was $747.2 million, or $7.28 per diluted share, an increase of 208.8%, or $505.2 million, compared to $242.0 million, or $2.38 per diluted share, for the same period of 2016.
The increase in net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited was primarily the result of the provisional income tax benefit of $339.9 million from U.S. tax reform and increases in operating income from Wynn Palace, Wynn Macau and our Las Vegas Operations, partially offset by increases in the Redemption Note fair value and interest expense as we are no longer capitalizing interest on Wynn Palace.
Wynn Palace opened on August 22, 2016, with our results for 2016 including 132 days of operations.For the year ended December 31, 2017, Adjusted Property EBITDA was $1.81 billion, an increase of 43.8%, or $551.4 million, from $1.26 billion for the same period of 2016.
The increase in Adjusted Property EBITDA was the result of increases of $424.5 million, $79.2 million, and $47.7 million from Wynn Palace, Wynn Macau and our Las Vegas Operations, respectively.Financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.Operating revenuesThe following table presents operating revenues from our Macau and Las Vegas Operations (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31,

The provision for doubtful accounts was $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with a benefit of $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The benefit in the prior year was due to the collection of certain casino accounts receivable resulting in the reversal of previously recorded allowance for doubtful accounts.

We incurred losses of $4.1 million and $21.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, from foreign currency remeasurements.
The losses were primarily due to the impact of the exchange rate fluctuation of the Macau pataca, in relation to the U.S. dollar, on the remeasurements of U.S. dollar denominated debt and other obligations from our Macau-related entities.
Income Taxes For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded tax benefits of $497.3 million and $329.0 million, respectively.

This agreement on dividends is effective through December 31, 2020.We have participated in the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Compliance Assurance Program ("CAP") for the 2012 through 2018 tax years and will continue to participate in the IRS CAP for the 2019 tax year.
In February 2017 and 2018, the IRS completed an examination of our 2015 and 2016 U.S. tax return, respectively, and had no changes.In March 2017, the Financial Services Bureau commenced an examination of the 2013 and 2014 Macau income tax returns of Wynn Macau SA.

Adjusted Property EBITDAWe use Adjusted Property EBITDA to manage the operating results of our segments.
Adjusted Property EBITDA is net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, litigation settlement expense, pre-opening expenses, property charges and other, management and license fees, corporate expenses and other (including intercompany golf course and water rights leases), stock-based compensation, (loss) gain on extinguishment of debt, change in derivatives fair value, change in Redemption Note fair value and other non-operating income and expenses.
Adjusted Property EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because we believe that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies.
We use Adjusted Property EBITDA as a measure of the operating performance of our segments and to compare the operating performance of our properties with those of our competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation.
We also present Adjusted Property EBITDA because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a company's ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements.
Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDA as a supplement to financial measures in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including us, have historically excluded from their EBITDA calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses and stock-based compensation that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties.
However, Adjusted Property EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP.
Unlike net income, Adjusted Property EBITDA does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital.
We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, income taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in Adjusted Property EBITDA.
Also, our calculation of Adjusted Property EBITDA may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.The following table summarizes Adjusted Property EBITDA (in thousands) for our Macau and Las Vegas Operations as reviewed by management and summarized in Item 8—"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," Note 16, "Segment Information."
That footnote also presents a reconciliation of Adjusted Property EBITDA to net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited.

Legal proceedings in which we are involved also may impact our liquidity.
No assurance can be provided as to the outcome of such proceedings.

Under the equity repurchase program, we may repurchase the Company's outstanding shares from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions, and under plans complying with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act.
As of December 31, 2018, we had $843.3 million in repurchase authority remaining under the program.We have in the past repurchased, and in the future, we may periodically consider repurchasing our outstanding notes for cash.
The amount of any notes to be repurchased, as well as the timing of any repurchases, will be based on business, market and other conditions and factors, including price, contractual requirements or consents, and capital availability.New business developments or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds.
We continue to explore opportunities to develop additional gaming or related businesses in domestic and international markets.
There can be no assurances regarding the business prospects with respect to any other opportunity.
Any new development would require us to obtain additional financing.
We may decide to conduct any such development through Wynn Resorts, Limited or through subsidiaries separate from the Las Vegas or Macau-related entities.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor do we engage in any derivatives except for an interest rate collar.

As further discussed in Item 8—"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," Note 12, "Income Taxes," we had $99.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2018.
Due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions, it is not practicable to assign this liability to any particular year and therefore it is not included in the table above as of December 31, 2018.
(3)Other excludes community payments associated with the continuing operations of Encore Boston Harbor, which commence upon the opening of the resort.
These amounts are approximately $10.6 million per year with minimal annual increases.58 Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP involves the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements.
Certain of our accounting policies require management to apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates and on an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates.
Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate.
However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates.Development, Construction and Property and Equipment EstimatesDuring the construction and development of a resort, pre-opening or start-up costs are expensed when incurred.
In connection with the construction and development of our resorts, significant start-up costs are incurred and charged to pre-opening costs through their respective openings.
Once our resorts open, expenses associated with the opening of the resorts are no longer charged as pre-opening costs.During the construction and development stage, direct costs such as those incurred for the design and construction of our resorts, including applicable portions of interest, are capitalized.
Accordingly, the recorded amounts of property and equipment increase significantly during construction periods.
Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method.
We determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets, estimates of the usage of the asset and other factors specific to the asset.
Depreciation expense related to capitalized construction costs and fixed assets commence when the related assets are placed in service.
The remaining estimated useful lives of assets are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary.Costs of repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred.
The cost and accumulated depreciation of property and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in property charges and other.
We also evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
For assets to be disposed of we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, solicited offers, or a discounted cash flow model.
For assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.
In reviewing for impairment, we compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset.
If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated.
If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model.
If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs.
All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.Redemption Price Promissory NoteWe recorded the Redemption Note at its fair value in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.
As of December 31, 2017, the fair value of the Redemption Note was $1.88 billion.
We utilized an independent third party valuation to assist in the determination of this fair value.
In determining this fair value, we estimated the Redemption Note's present value using discounted cash flows with a probability-weighted expected return for redemption assumptions and a discount rate, which included time value and non-performance risk adjustments commensurate with the risk of the Redemption Note.
In determining the appropriate discount rate to be used in the estimated present value, the Redemption Note's subordinated position and credit risk relative to all other debt in our capital structure and credit ratings associated with our traded debt were considered.
Observable inputs for the risk-free rate based on Federal Reserve rates for U.S. Treasury securities and credit risk spread based on a yield curve index of similarly rated debt were used.
The Company repaid the principal amount in full on March 30, 2018.
59 Table of ContentsAllowance for Estimated Doubtful Accounts ReceivableA substantial portion of our outstanding receivables relates to casino credit play.
Credit play, through the issuance of markers, represents a significant portion of the table games volume at our Las Vegas Operations.
While offered, the issuance of credit at our Macau Operations is less significant when compared to Las Vegas.
Our goal is to maintain strict controls over the issuance of credit and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their balances in a timely fashion.
These collection efforts may include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and litigation.
Markers issued at our Las Vegas Operations are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United States, and United States assets of foreign customers may be used to satisfy judgments entered in the United States.The enforceability of markers and other forms of credit related to gaming debt outside of the United States varies from country to country.
Some foreign countries do not recognize the enforceability of gaming related debt, or make enforcement burdensome.
We closely consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when issuing credit to customers who are not residents of the United States.
In addition to our internal credit and collection departments, located in both Las Vegas and Macau, we have a network of legal, accounting and collection professionals to assist us in our determinations regarding enforceability and our overall collection efforts.As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, 85.0% and 81.7%, respectively, of our casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from foreign countries, primarily in Asia.
In addition to enforceability issues, the collectability of markers given to foreign customers is affected by a number of factors, including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers' home countries.We regularly evaluate our reserve for bad debts based on a specific review of customer accounts and outstanding gaming promoter accounts as well as management's prior experience with collection trends in the casino industry and current economic and business conditions.
In determining our allowance for estimated doubtful accounts receivable, we apply loss factors based on historical marker collection history to aged account balances and we specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over a specified dollar amount, based upon the age, the customer's financial condition, collection history and any other known information.The following table presents key statistics related to our casino accounts receivable (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2018 2017Casino accounts receivable$229,594 $173,664Allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable31,263 28,841Allowance as a percentage of casino accounts receivable13.6% 16.6%Our reserve for doubtful casino accounts receivable is based on our estimates of amounts collectible and depends on the risk assessments and judgments by management regarding realizability, the state of the economy and our credit policy.
Our reserve methodology is applied similarly to credit extended at each of our resorts.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, 57.9% and 42.4%, respectively, of our outstanding casino accounts receivable balance originated at our Macau Operations.
As of December 31, 2018, a 100 basis point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change the provision for doubtful accounts by approximately $2.3 million.As our customer payment experience evolves, we will continue to refine our estimated reserve for bad debts.
Accordingly, the associated provision for doubtful accounts may fluctuate.
Because individual customer account balances can be significant, the reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods as we become aware of additional information about a customer or changes occur in a region's economy or legal system.Litigation and Contingency EstimatesWe are subject to various claims, legal actions and other contingencies, and we accrue for these matters when they are both probable and estimable.
For matters that arose on or prior to the balance sheet date, we estimate any accruals based on the relevant facts and circumstances available through the date of issuance of the financial statements.
We include the accruals associated with any contingent matters in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.60 Table of ContentsIncome TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate.
Accounting standards require the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect of a change in tax rates on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities generally is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
Accounting standards require recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not.
Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.As of December 31, 2018, we have a foreign tax credit ("FTC") carryover of $3.19 billion and we have recorded a valuation allowance of $2.49 billion against this asset based on our estimate of future realization.
The FTCs are attributable to the Macau special gaming tax, which is 35% of gross gaming revenue in Macau.
In the assessment of the valuation allowance, appropriate consideration was given to all positive and negative evidence including recent operating profitability, forecasts of future earnings and the duration of statutory carryforward periods.
Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the IRS and other tax authorities in the locations where we operate.
We assess potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on accounting standards for uncertain income taxes.
The accounting standards prescribe a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.Uncertain tax position accounting standards apply to all tax positions related to income taxes.
These accounting standards utilize a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions.
The tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement.As applicable, we recognize accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.Recently Adopted Accounting Standards and Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet AdoptedSee Item 8—"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk In the normal course of business, our financial position is subject to market risk, including, but not limited to, potential losses due to changes in the value of financial instruments including those resulting from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market valuation.Interest Rate RisksOne of our primary exposures to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our debt facilities that bear interest based on floating rates.
We attempt to manage interest rate risk by managing the mix of long-term fixed rate borrowings and variable rate borrowings, supplemented by hedging activities as believed by us to be appropriate.
We cannot assure you that these risk management strategies have had the desired effect, and interest rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
The following table provides estimated future cash flow information derived from our best estimates of repayments as of December 31, 2018, of our expected long-term indebtedness and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates.
However, we cannot predict the LIBOR or HIBOR rates that will be in effect in the future.
Actual rates will vary.
The one-month LIBOR and HIBOR rates as of December 31, 2018 of 2.52% and 2.27%, respectively, were used for all variable rate calculations in the table below.61 Table of ContentsThe information is presented in U.S. dollar equivalents as applicable.

Based on our borrowings as of December 31, 2018, an assumed 100 basis point change in the variable rates would cause our annual interest cost to change by $50.3 million.Foreign Currency RisksThe currency delineated in Wynn Macau SA's concession agreement with the government of Macau is the Macau pataca.
The Macau pataca, which is not a freely convertible currency, is linked to the Hong Kong dollar, and in many cases the two are used interchangeably in Macau.
The Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years.
However, the exchange linkages of the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca, and the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar, are subject to potential changes due to, among other things, changes in Chinese governmental policies and international economic and political developments.If the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca are not linked to the U.S. dollar in the future, severe fluctuations in the exchange rate for these currencies may result.
We also cannot assure you that the current rate of exchange fixed by the applicable monetary authorities for these currencies will remain at the same level.We expect most of the revenues and expenses for any casino that we operate in Macau will be in Hong Kong dollars or Macau patacas.
For any U.S. dollar-denominated debt or other obligations incurred by our Macau-related entities, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Macau pataca or the Hong Kong dollar, in relation to the U.S. dollar, could have adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to service debt.
Based on our balances as of December 31, 2018, an assumed 100 basis point change in the US dollar/Hong Kong dollar exchange rate would cause a foreign currency transaction gain/loss of $28.1 million.62 Table of Contents
