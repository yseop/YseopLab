Item 7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.OverviewWe are a developer, owner and operator of destination casino resorts (integrated resorts).
In Macau, we own approximately 72% of WML, which includes the operations of the Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace resorts.
In Las Vegas, Nevada, we operate and, with the exception of certain retail space, own 100% of Wynn Las Vegas.
We are currently constructing Wynn Boston Harbor, an integrated casino resort in Everett, Massachusetts.
Macau OperationsWynn Macau features two luxury hotel towers with a total of 1,008 guest rooms and suites, approximately 273,000 square feet of casino space, eight food and beverage outlets, approximately 31,000 square feet of meeting and convention space, approximately 59,000 square feet of retail space, a rotunda show and recreation and leisure facilities.
On August 22, 2016, we opened Wynn Palace, an integrated resort in the Cotai area of Macau.
Wynn Palace features a luxury hotel tower with 1,706 guest rooms, suites and villas, approximately 420,000 square feet of casino space, 11 food and beverage outlets, approximately 37,000 square feet of meeting and convention space, approximately 106,000 square feet of retail space, public attractions, including a performance lake and floral art displays, and recreation and leisure facilities.Las Vegas OperationsWynn Las Vegas features two luxury hotel towers with a total of 4,748 guest rooms, suites and villas, approximately 192,000 square feet of casino space, 33 food and beverage outlets, approximately 290,000 square feet of meeting and convention space, approximately 110,000 square feet of retail space (of which 103,000 square feet is owned and operated under a joint venture arrangement of which we own 50.1%), as well as two theaters, three nightclubs, a beach club, and recreation and leisure facilities.
In December 2016, we entered into the Retail Joint Venture with Crown to own and operate approximately 88,000 square feet of existing retail space.
In November 2017, we contributed approximately 74,000 square feet of additional retail space to the Retail Joint Venture, the majority of which is currently under construction at Wynn Las Vegas.
We expect to open the additional retail space in the second half of 2018.
For more information on the Retail Joint Venture, see Item 8—"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," Note 3, "Retail Joint Venture.
"Development ProjectsWe are currently constructing Wynn Boston Harbor, an integrated resort in Everett, Massachusetts, adjacent to Boston along the Mystic River.
The resort will contain a hotel, a waterfront boardwalk, meeting and convention space, casino space, a spa, retail offerings and food and beverage outlets.
The total project budget, including gaming license fees, construction costs, capitalized interest, pre-opening expenses and land costs, is estimated to be approximately $2.5 billion.
As of December 31, 2017, we have incurred approximately $1.13 billion in total project costs.
We expect to open Wynn Boston Harbor in mid-2019.
We have begun site preparation and pre-construction activities for the redevelopment of the land previously occupied by the Wynn Las Vegas golf course, which we closed in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Phase 1 of the project is expected to include a lagoon and additional meeting and convention space.
Based on current designs, we estimate the total project budget for Phase 1 to be approximately $500 million and we expect to open Phase 1 in the first half of 2020.We continually seek out new opportunities for additional gaming or related businesses, in the United States, and worldwide.
Key Operating MeasuresCertain key operating measures specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussion of our operational performance for the periods for which the Consolidated Statements of Income are presented.
Below are definitions of these key operating measures discussed: 37 Table of Contents•Table drop for our Macau Operations is the amount of cash that is deposited in a gaming table's drop box plus cash chips purchased at the casino cage.
•Table drop for our Las Vegas Operations is the amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming table's drop box.•Rolling chips are identifiable chips that are used to track turnover for purposes of calculating incentives.
•Turnover is the sum of all losing rolling chip wagers within our Macau Operations' VIP program.
•Table games win is the amount of table drop or turnover that is retained and recorded as casino revenues.•Slot machine win is the amount of handle (representing the total amount wagered) that is retained by us and is recorded as casino revenues.
•Average daily rate ("ADR") is calculated by dividing total room revenues, including the retail value of promotional allowances (less service charges, if any), by total rooms occupied, including complimentary rooms.
•Revenue per available room ("REVPAR") is calculated by dividing total room revenues, including the retail value of promotional allowances (less service charges, if any), by total rooms available.
•Occupancy is calculated by dividing total occupied rooms, including complimentary rooms, by the total rooms available.
Below is a discussion of the methodologies used to calculate win percentages at our resorts.In our VIP operations in Macau, customers primarily purchase rolling chips from the casino cage and can only use them to make wagers.
Winning wagers are paid in cash chips.
The loss of the rolling chips in the VIP operations is recorded as turnover and provides a base for calculating VIP win percentage.
It is customary in Macau to measure VIP play using this rolling chip method.
We expect our win as a percentage of turnover from these operations to be within the range of 2.7% to 3.0%.
In our mass market operations in Macau, customers may purchase cash chips at either the gaming tables or at the casino cage.The measurements from our VIP and mass market operations are not comparable as the measurement method used in our mass market operations tracks the initial purchase of chips at the table and at the casino cage, while the measurement method from our VIP operations tracks the sum of all losing wagers.
Accordingly, the base measurement from the VIP operations is much larger than the base measurement from the mass market operations.
As a result, the expected win percentage with the same amount of gaming win is smaller in the VIP operations when compared to the mass market operations.
In Las Vegas, customers purchase chips at the gaming tables.
The cash and net markers used to purchase chips are deposited in the gaming table's drop box.
This is the base of measurement that we use for calculating win percentage in Las Vegas.
Each type of table game has its own theoretical win percentage.
Our expected table games win percentage in Las Vegas is 21% to 25%.Results of OperationsSummary annual resultsThe following table summarizes our financial results for the periods presented (in thousands, except per share data).
Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015Net revenues$6,306,368 $4,466,297 $4,075,883Net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited747,181 241,975 195,290Diluted net income per share7.28 2.38 1.92Adjusted Property EBITDA1,810,732 1,259,327 1,185,789During the year ended December 31, 2017, our net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited was $747.2 million, or $7.28 per diluted share, an increase of 208.8%, or $505.2 million, compared to $242.0 million, or $2.38 per diluted share, for the same period of 2016.
The increase in net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited was primarily the result of the provisional income tax benefit from U.S. tax reform and increases in operating income from Wynn Palace, Wynn Macau and our Las Vegas Operations, partially offset by increases in the Redemption Note fair value and interest expense as we are no longer capitalizing interest on Wynn Palace.
Wynn Palace opened on August 22, 2016, with our results for the year ended December 31, 2016 including 132 days of operations.
38 Table of ContentsAdjusted Property EBITDA was $1.81 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 43.8%, or $551.4 million, from $1.26 billion for the same period of 2016.

The increase in net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited was primarily due to a loss on extinguishment of debt in 2015 that was not experienced in 2016.
Adjusted Property EBITDA was $1.26 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 6.2%, or $73.5 million, from $1.19 billion for the same period of 2015.
The increase in Adjusted Property EBITDA was primarily due to the new operations associated with the opening of Wynn Palace, partially offset by a decrease of 3.8% from Wynn Macau driven by a decrease in business volumes.

The increase was primarily due to casino revenues of $519.9 million from Wynn Palace, partially offset by a $177.7 million decrease from Wynn Macau.
The decline in casino revenues from Wynn Macau was driven by a decrease in business volumes from both our VIP and mass market operations, with decreases in VIP turnover of 18.8%, table drop of 5.6% and slot handle of 14.5%.
The business volume decrease for Wynn Macau was primarily driven by the impact from the economic and political conditions in Macau and China, as well as from resort openings in the Cotai area of Macau, including Wynn Palace.
We experienced a VIP win as a percentage of turnover of 3.29% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 2.87% for the same period of 2015, which partially offset the business volume decrease in our VIP operations.Prior to the opening of Wynn Palace, the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau of Macau authorized 100 new table games for operation at Wynn Palace with 25 additional table games authorized for operation on January 1, 2017, and a further 25 new table games for operation on January 1, 2018, for a total of 150 new table games in the aggregate.
In addition, we have and will continue to transfer table games between Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace, subject to the aggregate cap, to optimize our casino operations.

Provision for doubtful accounts decreased 26.2%, or $2.9 million, to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $11.1 million for the same period of 2015.
The change in the provision was primarily due to increased collections of certain casino accounts receivable at Wynn Macau.
Pre-opening expenses were $154.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $77.6 million for the same period of 2015.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred pre-opening expenses of $129.8 million related to Wynn Palace, $22.7 million related to Wynn Boston Harbor and $2.3 million related to our Las Vegas Operations.

Income Taxes For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded a tax expense of $8.1 million and $7.7 million, respectively, primarily related to an increase in our deferred tax liabilities.For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we were exempt from the payment of $27.3 million and $41.6 million, respectively, under our exemption from the Macau Complementary Tax on gaming profits.
Our non-gaming profits remain subject to the Macau Complementary Tax and casino winnings remain subject to the Macau special gaming tax and other levies together totaling 39% in accordance with our concession agreement.Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $60.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $86.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
These amounts are primarily related to the noncontrolling interests' share of net income from WML.
Adjusted Property EBITDAWe use Adjusted Property EBITDA to manage the operating results of our segments.
Adjusted Property EBITDA is net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, pre-opening expenses, property charges and other, management and license fees, corporate expenses and other (including intercompany golf course and water rights leases), stock-based compensation, loss on extinguishment of debt, change in interest rate swap fair value, change in Redemption Note fair value and other non-operating income and expenses, and includes equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates.
Adjusted Property EBITDA is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies.
Management uses Adjusted Property EBITDA as a measure of the operating performance of its segments and to compare the operating performance of its properties with those of its competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation.
We also present Adjusted Property EBITDA because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a company's ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements.
Gaming companies have historically reported EBITDA as a supplement to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including us, have historically excluded from their EBITDA calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses and stock-based compensation, that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties.
However, Adjusted Property EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an 51 Table of Contentsindicator of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP.
Unlike net income, Adjusted Property EBITDA does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital.
We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, income taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in Adjusted Property EBITDA.
Also, our calculation of Adjusted Property EBITDA may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.52 Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes Adjusted Property EBITDA (in thousands) for our Macau and Las Vegas Operations as reviewed by management and summarized in Item 8—"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," Note 15, "Segment Information."
That footnote also presents a reconciliation of Adjusted Property EBITDA to net income attributable to Wynn Resorts, Limited.

Based on the Board of Directors' finding of "unsuitability," on February 18, 2012, we redeemed and canceled Aruze's 24,549,222 shares of Wynn Resorts' common stock.
Following a finding of "unsuitability," our articles of incorporation authorize redemption at "fair value" of the shares held by unsuitable persons.
Pursuant to the articles of incorporation, we issued the Redemption Note to Aruze, a former stockholder and related party, in redemption of the shares.
The Redemption Note has a principal amount of approximately $1.94 billion, matures on February 18, 2022 and bears interest at the rate of 2% per annum, payable annually in arrears on each anniversary of the date of the Redemption Note.
We may, in our sole and absolute discretion, at any time and from time to time, and without penalty or premium, prepay the whole or any portion of the principal or interest due under the Redemption Note.
In no instance shall any payment obligation under the Redemption Note be accelerated except in the sole and absolute discretion of Wynn Resorts or as specifically mandated by law.
The indebtedness evidenced by the Redemption Note, is subordinated to the prior payment in full of all existing and future obligations of Wynn Resorts and any of its affiliates in respect of indebtedness for borrowed money of any kind or nature.
Aruze, Universal Entertainment Corporation and Kazuo Okada have challenged the redemption of Aruze's shares and we are currently involved in litigation with those parties as well as related stockholder derivative litigation.
The outcome of these various proceedings cannot be predicted.
Any adverse judgments or settlements involving payment of a material sum of money could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could expose us to additional claims by third parties, including current or former investors or regulators.
Any adverse judgments or settlements would reduce our profits and could limit our ability to operate our business.
See Item 1A—Risk Factors and Item 8—"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," Note 14, "Commitments and Contingencies.
"Other Factors Affecting LiquidityWynn Resorts is a holding company and, as a result, our ability to pay dividends is highly dependent on our ability to obtain funds and our subsidiaries' ability to provide funds to us.
Wynn America and Wynn Macau SA debt instruments contain customary negative covenants and financial covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants that restrict their ability to pay dividends or distributions to any direct or indirect subsidiaries.
Wynn Las Vegas, LLC intends to fund its operations and capital requirements from cash on hand and operating cash flow.
We cannot assure you, however, that our Las Vegas Operations will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or the availability of additional indebtedness will be sufficient to enable us to service and repay Wynn Las Vegas, LLC's indebtedness and to fund its other liquidity needs.
Similarly, we expect that our Macau Operations will fund Wynn Macau SA and WML's debt service obligations with existing cash, operating cash flow and availability under the Wynn Macau Credit Facilities.
However, we cannot assure you that operating cash flows will be sufficient to do so.
We may refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all.
Legal proceedings in which we are involved also may impact our liquidity.
No assurance can be provided as to the outcome of such proceedings.
In addition, litigation inherently involves significant costs.
For information regarding legal proceedings, see Item 8—"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," Note 14, "Commitments and Contingencies.
"Our Board of Directors has authorized an equity repurchase program.
Under the equity repurchase program, we may repurchase the Company's outstanding shares from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions, and under plans complying with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act.
As of December 31, 2017, we had $1.0 billion in repurchase authority under the program.
We have in the past repurchased, and in the future, we may periodically consider repurchasing our outstanding notes for cash.
The amount of any notes to be repurchased, as well as the timing of any repurchases, will be based on business, market and other conditions and factors, including price, contractual requirements or consents, and capital availability.59 Table of ContentsNew business developments or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds.
We continue to explore opportunities to develop additional gaming or related businesses in domestic and international markets.
There can be no assurances regarding the business prospects with respect to any other opportunity.
Any new development would require us to obtain additional financing.
We may decide to conduct any such development through Wynn Resorts or through subsidiaries separate from the Las Vegas or Macau-related entities.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor do we engage in any derivatives, except for interest rate swaps entered into in the past to manage interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings and foreign currency forward contracts.
We do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity.
As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $17.7 million.Contractual Commitments The following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands): Payments Due By Period LessThan1 Year 1 to 3Years 4 to 5Years After5 Years TotalLong-term debt obligations$62,690 $899,695 $4,272,856 $4,550,000 $9,785,241Fixed interest payments276,729 553,458 553,458 682,291 2,065,936Estimated variable interest payments (1)102,185 188,901 52,383 — 343,469Construction contracts and commitments596,699 267,358 — — 864,057Operating leases18,052 29,532 22,617 69,045 139,246Capital leases989 1,978 1,978 67,732 72,677Employment agreements65,791 64,132 7,690 — 137,613Other (2) (3)175,493 162,075 65,105 4,000 406,673Total contractual commitments$1,298,628 $2,167,129 $4,976,087 $5,373,068 $13,814,912(1)Amounts for all periods represent our estimated future interest payments on our debt facilities based upon amounts outstanding and LIBOR or HIBOR rates as of December 31, 2017.
Actual rates will vary.
(2)Other includes open purchase orders, future charitable contributions, fixed gaming tax payments in Macau, performance contracts and other contracts.
As further discussed in Item 8—"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," Note 13, "Income Taxes," we had $95.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2017.
Due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions, it is not practicable to assign this liability to any particular year and therefore it is not included in the table above as of December 31, 2017.
(3)Other excludes community payments associated with the continuing operations of Wynn Boston Harbor, which commence upon the opening of the resort.
These amounts are approximately $10.6 million per year with minimal annual increases.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP involves the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements.
Certain of our accounting policies require management to apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates and on an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates.
Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate.
However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates.Development, Construction and Property and Equipment EstimatesDuring the construction and development of a resort, pre-opening or start-up costs are expensed when incurred.
In connection with the construction and development of our resorts, significant start-up costs are incurred and charged to pre-opening costs through their respective openings.
Once our resorts open, expenses associated with the opening of the resorts are no longer charged as pre-opening costs.During the construction and development stage, direct costs such as those incurred for the design and construction of our resorts, including applicable portions of interest, are capitalized.
Accordingly, the recorded amounts of property and equipment 60 Table of Contentsincrease significantly during construction periods.
Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method.
We determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets, estimates of the usage of the asset and other factors specific to the asset.
Depreciation expense related to capitalized construction costs and fixed assets commence when the related assets are placed in service.
The remaining estimated useful lives of assets are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary.Costs of repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred.
The cost and accumulated depreciation of property and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in property charges and other.
We also evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
For assets to be disposed of we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, solicited offers, or a discounted cash flow model.
For assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.
In reviewing for impairment, we compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset.
If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated.
If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model.
If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs.
All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.Redemption Price Promissory NoteWe record the Redemption Note at its fair value in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the fair value of the Redemption Note was $1.88 billion and $1.82 billion, respectively.
We utilized an independent third party valuation to assist in the determination of this fair value.
In determining this fair value, we estimated the Redemption Note's present value using discounted cash flows with a probability-weighted expected return for redemption assumptions and a discount rate, which included time value and non-performance risk adjustments commensurate with the risk of the Redemption Note.Considerations for the redemption assumptions included the stated maturity of the Redemption Note, uncertainty of the related cash flows as well as potential effects of the following: uncertainties surrounding the potential outcome and timing of pending litigation with the Okada Parties (Item 8—"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," Note 14, "Commitments and Contingencies.
"); the outcome of ongoing investigations of Aruze by the United States Attorney's Office, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Nevada Gaming Control Board; and other potential legal and regulatory actions.
In addition, in the furtherance of various future business objectives, we considered our ability, at our sole option, to prepay the Redemption Note at any time in accordance with its terms without penalty.
Accordingly, we reasonably determined that the estimated life of the Redemption Note could be less than the contractual life of the Redemption Note.In determining the appropriate discount rate to be used in the estimated present value, the Redemption Note's subordinated position and credit risk relative to all other debt in our capital structure and credit ratings associated with our traded debt were considered.
Observable inputs for the risk-free rate based on Federal Reserve rates for U.S. Treasury securities and credit risk spread based on a yield curve index of similarly rated debt were used.
Allowance for Estimated Doubtful Accounts ReceivableA substantial portion of our outstanding receivables relates to casino credit play.
Credit play, through the issuance of markers, represents a significant portion of the table games volume at our Las Vegas Operations.
While offered, the issuance of credit at our Macau Operations is less significant when compared to Las Vegas.
Our goal is to maintain strict controls over the issuance of credit and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their balances in a timely fashion.
These collection efforts may include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and litigation.
Markers issued at our Las Vegas Operations are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United States, and United States assets of foreign customers may be used to satisfy judgments entered in the United States.The enforceability of markers and other forms of credit related to gaming debt outside of the United States varies from country to country.
Some foreign countries do not recognize the enforceability of gaming related debt, or make enforcement burdensome.
We closely consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when issuing credit to customers who are not residents of the United States.
In addition to our internal credit and collection departments, located in both Las Vegas and Macau, we have a network of legal, accounting and collection professionals to assist us in our determinations regarding enforceability and our overall collection efforts.61 Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, 81.7% and 88.1%, respectively, of our casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from foreign countries, primarily in Asia.
In addition to enforceability issues, the collectability of markers given to foreign customers is affected by a number of factors, including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers' home countries.We regularly evaluate our reserve for bad debts based on a specific review of customer accounts and outstanding gaming promoter accounts as well as management's prior experience with collection trends in the casino industry and current economic and business conditions.
In determining our allowance for estimated doubtful accounts receivable, we apply loss factors based on historical marker collection history to aged account balances and we specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over a specified dollar amount, based upon the age, the customer's financial condition, collection history and any other known information.The following table presents key statistics related to our casino accounts receivable (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2017 2016Casino accounts receivable$173,664 $211,557Allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable$28,841 $53,860Allowance as a percentage of casino accounts receivable16.6% 25.5%Our reserve for doubtful casino accounts receivable is based on our estimates of amounts collectible and depends on the risk assessments and judgments by management regarding realizability, the state of the economy and our credit policy.
Our reserve methodology is applied similarly to credit extended at each of our resorts.
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, 42.4% and 49.2%, respectively, of our outstanding casino accounts receivable balance originated at our Macau Operations.
As of December 31, 2017, a 100 basis point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change the provision for doubtful accounts by approximately $1.7 million.As our customer payment experience evolves, we will continue to refine our estimated reserve for bad debts.
Accordingly, the associated provision for doubtful accounts may fluctuate.
Because individual customer account balances can be significant, the reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods as we become aware of additional information about a customer or changes occur in a region's economy or legal system.Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities ("VIEs") in which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
The primary beneficiary is the party who has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and who has an obligation to absorb losses of the entity or a right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity.We assessed our ownership in the Retail Joint Venture with Crown based on consolidation accounting guidance and concluded that the Retail Joint Venture is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary based on our involvement in the leasing activities of the Retail Joint Venture.
As a result, we consolidate all of the Retail Joint Venture's assets, liabilities and results of operations.
We will evaluate our primary beneficiary designation on an ongoing basis and will assess the appropriateness of the Retail Joint Venture's VIE status when changes occur.
For more information on the Retail Joint Venture, see Item 8—"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," Note 3, "Retail Joint Venture.
"62 Table of ContentsInvestments and Fair ValueWe have made investments in domestic and foreign corporate debt securities and commercial paper.
Our investment policy requires investments to be investment grade and limits the amount of exposure to any one issuer with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.
We determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date.
Our investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income (loss).
Adjustments are made for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity computed under the effective interest method.
Such amortization is included in interest income together with realized gains and losses and the stated interest on such securities.We measure certain of our financial assets and liabilities, at fair value on a recurring basis pursuant to accounting standards for fair value measurements.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
These accounting standards establish a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.We obtain pricing information in determining the fair value of our available-for-sale securities from independent pricing vendors.
Based on our inquiries, the pricing vendors use various pricing models consistent with what other market participants would use.
The assumptions and inputs used by the pricing vendors are derived from observable market sources including: reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark curves, bids, offers and other market-related data.
We have not made adjustments to such prices.
Each quarter, we validate the fair value pricing methodology to determine the fair value consistent with applicable accounting guidance and to confirm that the securities are classified properly in the fair value hierarchy.
We also compare the pricing received from our vendors to independent sources for the same or similar securities.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate.
Accounting standards require the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect of a change in tax rates on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities generally is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
Accounting standards require recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not.
Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.As of December 31, 2017, we have a foreign tax credit ("FTC") carryover of $3.62 billion and we have recorded a valuation allowance of $3.27 billion against this asset based on our estimate of future realization.
The FTCs are attributable to the Macau special gaming tax, which is 35% of gross gaming revenue in Macau.
In the assessment of the valuation allowance, appropriate consideration was given to all positive and negative evidence including recent operating profitability, forecast of future earnings and the duration of statutory carryforward periods.
Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the IRS and other tax authorities in the locations where we operate.
We assess potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on accounting standards for uncertain income taxes.
The accounting standards prescribe a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.Uncertain tax position accounting standards apply to all tax positions related to income taxes.
These accounting standards utilize a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions.
The tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement.
As applicable, we recognize accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.Stock-Based CompensationAccounting standards for stock-based payments establish standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that are based 63 Table of Contentson the fair value of the entity's equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments.
It requires an entity to measure the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognize that cost over the service period.
We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the grant-date fair value of our stock options.
The Black-Scholes model uses assumptions of expected volatility, risk-free interest rates, the expected term of options granted, and expected rates of dividends.
Management determines these assumptions by reviewing current market rates, making industry comparisons and reviewing conditions relevant to our Company.The expected volatility and expected term assumptions can significantly impact the fair value of stock options.
We believe that the valuation techniques and the approach utilized to develop our assumptions are reasonable in calculating the fair value of the options we grant.
We estimate the expected stock price volatility using a combination of implied and historical factors related to our stock price in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
As our stock price fluctuates, this estimate will change.
A hypothetical 10% change in the volatility assumption for our options granted in 2017 would not have a material effect on the change in fair value.
Expected term represents the estimated average time between the option's grant date and its exercise date.
A hypothetical 10% change in the expected term assumption for our options granted in 2017 would not have a material effect on the change in fair value.
These assumed changes in fair value would have been recognized over the vesting schedule of such awards.Accounting standards also require the classification of stock-based compensation expense in the same financial statement line items as cash compensation, and therefore impacts our departmental expenses (and related operating margins), pre-opening expenses and construction in progress for our development projects and our general and administrative expenses, including corporate expenses.Recently Adopted Accounting Standards and Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet AdoptedSee Item 8—"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskIn the normal course of business, our financial position is subject to market risk, including, but not limited to, potential losses due to changes in the value of financial instruments including those resulting from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market valuation.Interest Rate RisksOne of our primary exposures to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our debt facilities that bear interest based on floating rates.
We attempt to manage interest rate risk by managing the mix of long-term fixed rate borrowings and variable rate borrowings, supplemented by hedging activities as believed by us to be appropriate.
We cannot assure you that these risk management strategies have had the desired effect, and interest rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
The following table provides estimated future cash flow information derived from our best estimates of repayments as of December 31, 2017, of our expected long-term indebtedness and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates.
However, we cannot predict the LIBOR or HIBOR rates that will be in effect in the future.
Actual rates will vary.
The one-month LIBOR and HIBOR rates as of December 31, 2017 of 1.57% and 1.19%, respectively, were used for all variable rate calculations in the table below.64 Table of ContentsThe information is presented in U.S. dollar equivalents as applicable.
Years Ending December 31,Expected Maturity Date 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Thereafter Total(dollars in millions)Long-term debt:

Based on our borrowings as of December 31, 2017, an assumed 100 basis point change in the variable rates would cause our annual interest cost to change by $33.0 million.Foreign Currency RisksThe currency delineated in Wynn Macau SA's concession agreement with the government of Macau is the Macau pataca.
The Macau pataca, which is not a freely convertible currency, is linked to the Hong Kong dollar, and in many cases the two are used interchangeably in Macau.
The Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years.
However, the exchange linkages of the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca, and the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar, are subject to potential changes due to, among other things, changes in Chinese governmental policies and international economic and political developments.If the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca are not linked to the U.S. dollar in the future, severe fluctuations in the exchange rate for these currencies may result.
We also cannot assure you that the current rate of exchange fixed by the applicable monetary authorities for these currencies will remain at the same level.We expect most of the revenues and expenses for any casino that we operate in Macau will be in Hong Kong dollars or Macau patacas.
For any U.S. dollar-denominated debt or other obligations incurred by our Macau-related entities, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Macau pataca or the Hong Kong dollar, in relation to the U.S. dollar, could have adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to service debt.
Based on our balances as of December 31, 2017, an assumed 1% change in the US dollar/Hong Kong dollar exchange rate would cause a foreign currency transaction gain/loss of $25.2 million.65 Table of Contents
