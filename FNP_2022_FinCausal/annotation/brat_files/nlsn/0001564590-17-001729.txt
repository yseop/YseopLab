Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction The following discussion and analysis should be read together with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto.
Further, this report may contain material that includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that reflect, when made, Nielsen’s current views with respect to current events and financial performance.
These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in “Item 1A.
Risk Factors.” Statements, other than those based on historical facts, which address activities, events or developments that we expect or anticipate may occur in the future are forward-looking statements.
Such forward-looking statements are and will be, as the case may be, subject to many risks, uncertainties and factors relating to Nielsen’s operations and business environment that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results, express or implied, by such forward-looking statements.
See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The terms “Company,” “Nielsen,” “we,” “our” or “us,” as used herein, refer to Nielsen Holdings plc and its consolidated subsidiaries unless otherwise stated or indicated by context.
Background and Executive Summary We are a leading global performance management company that provides clients with a comprehensive understanding of consumers and consumer behavior.
We deliver critical media and marketing information, analytics and industry expertise about what consumers buy (referred to herein as “Buy”) and what consumers read, watch and listen to (consumer interaction across the television, radio, digital and mobile viewing and listening platforms referred to herein as “Watch”) on a global and local basis.
Our measurement and analytical services help our clients maintain and strengthen their market positions and identify opportunities for profitable growth.
We have a presence in more than 100 countries, including many emerging markets, and hold leading market positions in many of our services and geographies.
We believe that important measures of our results of operations include revenue, operating income and Adjusted EBITDA (defined below).
Our long-term financial objectives include consistent revenue growth and expanding operating margins.
Accordingly, we are focused on geographic market and service offering expansion to drive revenue growth and improve operating efficiencies, including effective resource utilization, information technology leverage and overhead cost management.
Our business strategy is built upon a model that has traditionally yielded consistent revenue performance.
Typically, before the start of each year, more than 70% of our annual revenue has been committed under contracts in our combined Buy and Watch segments, which provides us with a high degree of stability for our revenue and allows us to effectively manage our profitability and cash flows.
We continue to look for growth opportunities through global expansion, specifically within emerging markets, as well as through the cross-platform expansion of our analytical services and measurement services.
Our restructuring and other productivity initiatives have been focused on a combination of improving operating leverage through targeted cost-reduction programs, business process improvements and portfolio restructuring actions, while at the same time investing in key programs to enhance future growth opportunities.
Achieving our business objectives requires us to manage a number of key risk areas.
Our growth objective of geographic market and service expansion requires us to maintain the consistency and integrity of our information and underlying processes on a global scale, and to invest effectively our capital in technology and infrastructure to keep pace with our clients’ demands and our competitors.
Our operating footprint across more than 100 countries requires disciplined global and local resource management of internal and third party providers to ensure success.
In addition, our high level of indebtedness requires active management of our debt profile, with a focus on underlying maturities, interest rate risk, liquidity and operating cash flows.
Business Segment Overview We align our business into two reporting segments: what consumers buy (consumer purchasing measurement and analytics), and what consumers watch and listen to (media audience measurement and analytics).
Our Buy and Watch segments are built on a foundation of proprietary data assets that are designed to yield essential insights for our clients to successfully measure, analyze and grow their businesses.
28 Our Buy segment provides measurement services, which include our core tracking and scan data (primarily transactional measurement data and consumer behavior information), and analytical services to businesses in the consumer packaged goods industry.
Our services also enable our clients to better manage their brands, uncover new sources of demand, launch and grow new products, analyze their sales, improve their marketing mix and establish more effective consumer relationships.
Our data is used by our clients to measure their market share, tracking billions of sales transactions per month in retail outlets around the world.
Our extensive database of retail and consumer information, combined with our advanced analytical capabilities, helps generate strategic insights that influence our clients’ key business decisions.
Within our Buy segment, we have two primary geographic groups, developed and emerging markets.
Developed markets primarily include the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia and South Korea while emerging markets include Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Russia, China, India and Southeast Asia.
Our Watch segment provides viewership and listening data and analytics primarily to the media and advertising industries for television, radio, digital and mobile viewing and listening platforms.
Our Watch data is used by our media clients to understand their audiences, establish the value of their advertising inventory and maximize the value of their content, and by our advertising clients to plan and optimize their spending.
Certain corporate costs, other than those described above, including those related to selling, finance, legal, human resources, and information technology systems, are considered operating costs and are allocated to our segments based on either the actual amount of costs incurred or on a basis consistent with the operations of the underlying segment.
Critical Accounting Policies The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
The most significant of these policies relate to: revenue recognition; business combinations including purchase price allocations; accruals for pension costs and other post-retirement benefits; accounting for income taxes; and valuation of long-lived assets including goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, computer software and stock-based compensation.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the valuation of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis.
Actual results could vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
For a summary of the significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies discussed below, see Note 1 – “Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” – to our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition We recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or information has been delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable and the collectability of the related revenue is reasonably assured.
A significant portion of our revenue is generated from information (primarily retail measurement and consumer panel services) and measurement (primarily from television, radio, internet and mobile audiences) services.
We generally recognize revenue from the sale of services as the services are performed and delivered to the consumer, which is usually ratably over the term of the contract(s).
Invoiced amounts are recorded as deferred revenue until earned.
Substantially all of our customer contracts are non-cancelable and non-refundable.
Certain of our revenue arrangements include multiple deliverables and in these arrangements, the individual deliverables within the contract that have stand-alone value to the customer are separated and recognized upon delivery based upon our best estimate of their selling prices.
These arrangements are not significant to our results of operations.
In certain cases, software is included as part of these arrangements to allow our customers to view delivered information and is provided for the term of the arrangement and is not significant to the marketing effort and is not sold separately.
Accordingly, software provided to our customers is considered to be incidental to the arrangements and is not recognized as a separate element.
A discussion of our revenue recognition policies, by segment, follows: Buy Revenue from our Buy segment, primarily from retail measurement services and consumer panel services, is recognized over the period during which the services are performed and information is delivered to the customer, primarily on a straight-line basis.
29 We also provide insights and solutions to customers through analytical studies that are recognized into revenue as value is delivered to the customer.
The pattern of revenue recognition for these contracts varies depending on the terms of the individual contracts, and may be recognized proportionally or deferred until the end of the contract term and recognized when the information has been delivered to the customer.
Watch Revenue from our Watch segment is primarily generated from television, radio, digital and mobile measurement services and recognized over the contract period, as the service is delivered to the customer, primarily on a straight-line basis.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense Recognition Our stock-based compensation programs are comprised of both stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”).
We measure the cost of all stock-based payments, including stock options, at fair value on the grant date and recognize such costs within the consolidated statements of operations; however, no expense is recognized for stock-based payments that do not ultimately vest.
We recognize expense associated with stock-based payments that vest upon a single date using the straight-line method.
For those that vest over time, an accelerated graded vesting is used.
We recorded $51 million, $48 million and $47 million of expense associated with stock-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
As of December 31, 2016, the aggregate grant date fair value of all outstanding vested and unvested options was $32 million and $29 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2016, approximately $36 million of unearned stock-based compensation related to unvested RSUs (net of estimated forfeitures) is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.3 years.
Fair Value Measurement Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment.
Stock-based compensation expense for time-based stock options is primarily based on the estimated grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which considers factors such as estimating the expected term of stock options, expected volatility of our stock, and the number of stock-based awards expected to be forfeited due to future terminations.
Some of the critical assumptions used in estimating the grant date fair value are presented in the table below: Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Expected life (years) 4.50-5.25 4.50-5.25 3.00-5.25 Risk-free interest rate 1.19-1.92 % 1.27-1.58 % 0.87%-1.66 % Expected dividend yield 2.29-2.90 % 2.18- 2.45 % 1.77% - 2.39 % Expected volatility 20.02-23.44 % 23.44-23.70 % 23.50%-25.32 % Weighted-average volatility 20.89 % 23.56 % 23.89 % We consider the historical option exercise behavior of our employees in estimating the expected life of our options granted, which we believe are representative of future behavior.
For 2016, 2015 and 2014, expected volatility was based on our historical volatility.
In addition, for stock-based awards where vesting is dependent upon achieving certain operating performance goals, we estimate the likelihood of achieving the performance goals.
The total number of performance restricted share units to be earned is subject to achievement of cumulative performance goals for the three year period.
Forty percent of the target award will be determined based on the Company’s relative total shareholder return and sixty percent of the target award will be determined based on free cash flow achievements.
The maximum payout is 200% of target.
The fair value of the target award related to free cash flow was the fair value on the date of the grant, and the fair value of the target awards related to relative shareholder return was based on the Monte Carlo model.
Differences between actual results and these estimates could have a material effect on our financial results.
The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent our best estimates and, although we believe them to be reasonable, these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment.
If factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of our option-pricing model in future periods or if we experience different forfeiture rates, the compensation expense that is derived may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current year.
30 Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity date of three months or less.
Cash and cash equivalents are carried at fair value.
Accounts Receivable The Company extends non-interest bearing trade credit to its customers in the ordinary course of business.
To minimize credit risk, ongoing credit evaluations of client’s financial condition are performed.
An estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable or returns are expected.
During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we sold $137 million and $50 million, respectively, of accounts receivables to a third party and recorded an immaterial loss on the sales to interest expense, net in the consolidated statement of operations.
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, $71 million and $50 million, respectively, remained outstanding.
The sales were accounted for as true sales, without recourse.
We maintain servicing responsibilities of the receivables, for which the related costs are not significant.
The proceeds of $137 million and $50 million from the sale were reported as a component of the changes in trade and other receivables, net within operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting of certain trade names and trademarks, are each tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable.
We have designated October 1st as the date in which the annual assessment is performed as this timing corresponds with the development of our formal budget and business plan review.
We review the recoverability of our goodwill by comparing the estimated fair values of reporting units with their respective carrying amounts.
We established, and continue to evaluate, our reporting units based on our internal reporting structure and define such reporting units at our operating segment level or one level below.
The estimates of fair value of a reporting unit are determined using a combination of valuation techniques, primarily by an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis and supplemented by a market-based approach.
A discounted cash flow analysis requires the use of various assumptions, including expectations of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and tax rates in developing the present value of future cash flow projections.
Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside of the control of management, and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods.
Changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit, and therefore could affect the amount of potential impairment.
The following assumptions are significant to our discounted cash flow analysis: • Business projections – expected future cash flows and growth rates are based on assumptions about the level of business activity in the marketplace as well as applicable cost levels that drive our budget and business plans.
The budget and business plans are updated at least annually and are frequently reviewed by management and our board of directors.
Actual results of operations, cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation, and it is possible that differences and changes could be material.
A deterioration in profitability, adverse market conditions and a slower or weaker economic recovery than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future.
Should such events or circumstances arise, management would evaluate other options available at that time that, if executed, could result in future profitability.
• Long-term growth rates – the assumed long-term growth rate representing the expected rate at which a reporting unit’s earnings stream, beyond that of the budget and business plan period, is projected to grow.
These rates are used to calculate the terminal value, or value at the end of the future earnings stream, of our reporting units, and are added to the cash flows projected for the budget and business plan period.
The long-term growth rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit such as the maturity of the underlying services.
The long-term growth rates we used for each of our reporting units in our 2016 evaluation were between 1.0% and 3.0%.
• Discount rates – the reporting unit’s combined future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted-average cost of capital that is likely to be used by market participants.
The weighted-average cost of capital is our estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise.
The discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit.
The discount rates we used in our 2016 evaluation of our reporting units were between 8.5% and 9.5%.
31 These estimates and assumptions vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit.
We believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable, but they are susceptible to change from period to period.
We also use a market-based approach in estimating the fair value of our reporting units.
The market-based approach utilizes available market comparisons such as indicative industry multiples that are applied to current year revenue and earnings as well as recent comparable transactions.
To validate the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values, we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units to our enterprise market capitalization.
Enterprise market capitalization includes, among other factors, the market value of our common stock and the appropriate redemption values of our debt.
We did not have any indicators of impairment during the year ended December 31, 2016 that would require us to perform an interim impairment assessment.
Our annual impairment assessment, performed as of October 1, 2016, resulted in no impairment.
Further, all three reporting units have fair values exceeding carrying values by at least 20% as of the annual impairment assessment date.
We perform sensitivity analyses on our assumptions, primarily around both long-term growth rate and discount rate assumptions.
Our sensitivity analyses include several combinations of reasonably possible scenarios with regard to these assumptions.
However, we consistently test a one percent movement in both our long-term growth rate and discount rate assumptions.
When applying these sensitivity analyses, we noted that the fair value was greater than the underlying book value for all of our reporting units.
While management believes that these sensitivity analyses provide a reasonable basis on which to evaluate the recovery of our goodwill, other facts or circumstances may arise that could impact the impairment assessment and therefore these analyses should not be used as a sole predictor of impairment.
The impairment test for other indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount.
If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
The estimates of fair value of trade names and trademarks are determined using a “relief from royalty” discounted cash flow valuation methodology.
Significant assumptions inherent in this methodology include estimates of royalty rates and discount rates.
Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the respective intangible assets.
Assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which comparable trade names and trademarks are being licensed in the marketplace.
Pension Costs We provide a number of retirement benefits to our employees, including defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical plans.
Pension costs, in respect of defined benefit pension plans, primarily represent the increase in the actuarial present value of the obligation for pension benefits based on employee service during the year and the interest on this obligation in respect of employee service in previous years, net of the expected return on plan assets.
Differences between this expected return and the actual return on these plan assets and actuarial changes are not recognized in the statement of operations, unless the accumulated differences and changes exceed a certain threshold.
The excess is amortized and charged to the statement of operations over, at the maximum, the average remaining term of employee service.
We recognize obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans as expenses in the statement of operations as they are incurred.
The determination of benefit obligations and expenses is based on actuarial models.
In order to measure benefit costs and obligations using these models, critical assumptions are made with regard to the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, the assumed rate of compensation increases and longevity changes in the local jurisdictions.
We provide retiree medical benefits to a limited number of participants in the U.S. and have ceased to provide retiree health care benefits to certain of our Dutch retirees.
Therefore, retiree medical care cost trend rates are not a significant driver of our post retirement costs.
Management reviews these critical assumptions at least annually.
Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as turnover, retirement and mortality rates.
Management reviews these assumptions periodically and updates them as necessary.
The discount rate is the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled.
For our U.S. plans, the discount rate is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency.
For the Dutch and other non-U.S. plans, the discount rate is set by reference to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds.
We believe the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds in these portfolios are expected to match the estimated payment benefit streams of our plans.
32 Effective January 1, 2016, we changed our approach to calculating the discount rate for our retirement benefit pension plans from a weighted-average yield curve approach to a spot-rate approach.
Under the spot-rate approach, we use individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments in order to calculate interest cost and service cost within net periodic benefit costs.
The spot-rate approach represents a more precise measurement of interest and service cost.
The new approach represents a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle and accordingly is accounted for prospectively and had an immaterial impact to the consolidated financial statements.
To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider, for each country, the structure of the asset portfolio and the expected rates of return for each of the components.
For our U.S. plans, a 50 basis point decrease in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense on our principal plans by approximately $1 million per year.
A similar 50 basis point decrease in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense on our principal Dutch plans by approximately $3 million per year.
We assumed that the weighted-averages of long-term returns on our pension plans was 5.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 6.0% for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
The expected long-term rate of return is applied to the fair value of pension plan assets.
The actual return on plan assets will vary year to year from this assumption.
Although the actual return on plan assets will vary from year to year, we believe it is appropriate to use long-term expected forecasts in selecting our expected return on plan assets.
As such, there can be no assurance that our actual return on plan assets will approximate the long-term expected forecasts.
Income Taxes We have a presence in more than 100 countries.
We have completed many material acquisitions and divestitures which have generated complex tax issues requiring management to use its judgment to make various tax determinations.
We try to organize the affairs of our subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner, taking into consideration the jurisdictions in which we operate.
Although we are confident that tax returns have been appropriately prepared and filed, there is risk that additional tax may be assessed on certain transactions or that the deductibility of certain expenditures may be disallowed for tax purposes.
Our policy is to estimate tax risk to the best of our ability and provide accordingly for those risks and take positions in which a high degree of confidence exists that the tax treatment will be accepted by the tax authorities.
The policy with respect to deferred taxation is to provide in full for temporary differences using the liability method.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are computed by assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
The carrying value of deferred tax assets is adjusted by a valuation allowance to the extent that these deferred tax assets are not considered to be realized on a more likely than not basis.
Realization of deferred tax assets is based, in part, on our judgment and various factors including reversal of deferred tax liabilities, our ability to generate future taxable income in jurisdictions where such assets have arisen and potential tax planning strategies.
Valuation allowances are recorded in order to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized in the future.
We record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Such tax positions are, based solely on their technical merits, more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities and reflect the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information.
We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
Long-Lived Assets We are required to assess whether the value of our long-lived assets, including our buildings, improvements, technical and other equipment, and amortizable intangible assets have been impaired whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable.
We do not perform a periodic assessment of assets for impairment in the absence of such information or indicators.
Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable.
Recoverability of assets that are held and used is measured by comparing the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be derived from an asset (or a group of assets) to their carrying value.
If the carrying value of the asset (or the group of assets) exceeds the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows, impairment is considered to exist.
If impairment is considered to exist based on undiscounted cash flows, the impairment charge is measured using an estimation of the assets’ fair value, typically using a discounted cash flow method.
The identification of impairment indicators, the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of fair values for assets (or groups of assets) requires us to make significant judgments concerning the identification and validation of impairment indicators, expected cash flows and applicable discount rates.
These estimates are subject to revision as market conditions and our assessments change.
No impairment indicators were noted for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
33 We capitalize software development costs with respect to major internal use software initiatives or enhancements.
The costs are capitalized from the time that the preliminary project stage is completed, and we consider it probable that the software will be used to perform the function intended until the time the software is placed in service for its intended use.
Once the software is placed in service, the capitalized costs are generally amortized over periods of three to seven years.
If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of software may not be recovered, a recoverability analysis is performed based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the software in the future.
If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the software cost is written down to estimated fair value and an impairment is recognized.
These estimates are subject to revision as market conditions and as our assessments change.
There were no impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Factors Affecting Nielsen’s Financial Results Acquisitions, Dispositions and Investments in Affiliates Acquisitions For the year ended December 31, 2016, we paid cash consideration of $285 million associated with both current period and previously executed acquisitions, net of cash acquired.
Had these current period’s acquisitions occurred as of January 1, 2016, the impact on our consolidated results of operations would not have been material.
For the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid cash consideration of $246 million associated with both current period and previously executed acquisitions, net of cash acquired.
Included in this amount is $45 million for an additional 13.5% interest in Nielsen Catalina Solutions, a joint venture between us and Catalina (“NCS”) that we historically accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
As part of this transaction we gained control of NCS and, as such accounted for it as a step-acquisition and calculated the fair value of the investment immediately before the acquisition to be $161 million.
As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a $158 million gain on the investment in NCS to other income/(expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations.
Commencing October 1, 2015, NCS was reflected as a consolidated subsidiary within our consolidated financial statements.
Had that period’s acquisitions occurred as of January 1, 2015, the impact on our consolidated results of operations would not have been material.
For the year ended December 31, 2014, we paid cash consideration of $314 million associated with both current period and previously executed acquisitions (including Harris Interactive, Inc.), net of cash acquired.
Had that period’s acquisitions occurred as of January 1, 2014, the impact on our consolidated results of operations would not have been material.
Subsequent Event Gracenote In February 2017, we completed the acquisition of Gracenote, through the purchase of 100% of Gracenote’s outstanding common stock for a total cash purchase price of $560 million.
We acquired the data and technology that underpins the programming guides and personalized user experience for major video, music, audio and sports content.
This acquisition extends our footprint with major clients by including Gracenote’s global content database which spans across platforms including multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs), smart televisions, streaming music services, connected devices, media players and in-car infotainment systems.
Gracenote will consolidate into our Watch segment.
This Acquisition will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires, among other things, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date.
We are in the process of preparing the initial accounting of the transaction and expect to establish a preliminary purchase price allocation by the end of the first quarter of 2017.
Discontinued Operations and Other Dispositions In December 2016, we completed the sale of Claritas, a business focusing on consumer segmentation insights within our Buy segment, for cash consideration of $34 million and a note receivable for $60 million.
The note is payable at any time over three years and bears interest at 3% in year one, 5% in year two and 7% in year three.
As a result of this transaction we recorded a $14 million gain on the sale to other income/(expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations.
This disposition did not qualify to be classified as a discontinued operation.
34 In November 2015, we completed the sale of the National Research Group, Inc., a leader in providing market research to movie studios within our Watch segment, for total cash consideration of $34 million and recorded an $18 million gain on the sale to other income/(expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations.
This disposition did not qualify to be classified as a discontinued operation.
In February 2014, we completed the acquisition of Harris Interactive, Inc., a leading global market research firm, through the purchase of all outstanding shares of Harris Interactive’s common stock.
In June 2014, we completed the sale of Harris Interactive European operations (“Harris Europe”) to ITWP Acquisitions Limited (“ITWP”), the parent company of Toluna, a leading digital market research and technology company in exchange for a minority stake in ITWP.
The consolidated statements of operations reflect the operating results of Harris Europe as a discontinued operation.
Summarized results of operations for discontinued operations are as follows: Year Ended December 31, (IN MILLIONS) 2014 Revenue $ 15 Operating income — Interest expense — Income from operations before income taxes — Provision for income taxes — Income from operations — Gain on sale, net of tax — Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest — Income from discontinued operations, net of tax $ — There were no results from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Foreign Currency Our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars and are therefore subject to the impact of movements in exchange rates on the translation of the financial information of individual businesses whose functional currencies are other than U.S. dollars.
Our principal foreign exchange revenue exposure is spread across several currencies, primarily the Euro.
The table below sets forth the profile of our revenue by principal currency.
Year endedDecember 31,2016 Year endedDecember 31,2015 Year endedDecember 31,2014 U.S. Dollar 61 % 60 % 56 % Euro 9 % 9 % 11 % Other Currencies 30 % 31 % 33 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % As a result, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact our operating results.
Impacts associated with fluctuations in foreign currency are discussed in more detail under “Item 7A.—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.” In countries with currencies other than the U.S. dollar, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using end-of-period exchange rates; revenues, expenses and cash flows are translated using average rates of exchange.
The average U.S. dollar to Euro exchange rate was $1.11 to €1.00, $1.11 to €1.00 and $1.33 to €1.00 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Constant currency growth rates used in the following discussion of results of operations eliminate the impact of year-over-year foreign currency fluctuations.
We evaluate our results of operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis.
The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of year-over-year fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
We believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our results of operations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our business performance and is consistent with how management evaluates the Company’s performance.
We calculate constant currency percentages by converting our prior-period local currency financial results using the current period exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current period reported results.
This calculation may differ from similarly-titled measures used by others and, accordingly, the constant currency presentation is not meant to be a substitution for recorded amounts presented in conformity with GAAP nor should such amounts be considered in isolation.
35 Results of Operations – Years Ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amounts included in our consolidated statements of operations: Year Ended December 31, (IN MILLIONS) 2016 2015 2014 Revenues $ 6,309 $ 6,172 $ 6,288 Cost of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below 2,607 2,539 2,620 Selling, general and administrative expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below 1,851 1,915 1,917 Depreciation and amortization 603 574 573 Restructuring charges 105 51 89 Operating income 1,143 1,093 1,089 Interest income 4 4 3 Interest expense (333 ) (311 ) (300 ) Foreign currency exchange transaction losses, net (6 ) (31 ) (71 ) Other income/(expense), net 8 206 (100 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in net loss of affiliates 816 961 621 Provision for income taxes (309 ) (383 ) (236 ) Equity in net loss of affiliates — (3 ) (4 ) Net income 507 575 381 Net income/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 5 5 (3 ) Net income attributable to Nielsen stockholders $ 502 $ 570 $ 384 Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss from our consolidated statements of operations before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, restructuring charges, stock-based compensation expense and other non-operating items from our consolidated statements of operations as well as certain other items considered outside the normal course of our continuing operations specifically described below.
Restructuring charges: We exclude restructuring expenses, which primarily include employee severance, office consolidation and contract termination charges, from our Adjusted EBITDA to allow more accurate comparisons of the financial results to historical operations and forward-looking guidance.
By excluding these expenses from our non-GAAP measures, we are better able to evaluate our ability to utilize our existing assets and estimate the long-term value these assets will generate for us.
Furthermore, we believe that the adjustments of these items more closely correlate with the sustainability of our operating performance.
Stock-based compensation expense: We exclude the impact of costs relating to stock-based compensation.
Due to the subjective assumptions and a variety of award types, we believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense, which is typically non-cash, allows for more meaningful comparisons of our operating results to peer companies.
Stock-based compensation expense can vary significantly based on the timing, size and nature of awards granted.
Other non-operating income/(expense), net: We exclude foreign currency exchange transaction gains and losses primarily related to intercompany financing arrangements as well as other non-operating income and expense items, such as gains and losses recorded on business combinations or dispositions, sales of investments and early redemption payments made in connection with debt refinancing.
We believe that the adjustments of these items more closely correlate with the sustainability of our operating performance.
Other items: To measure operating performance we exclude certain expenses and gains that arise outside the ordinary course of our continuing operations.
Such costs primarily include legal settlements, acquisition related expenses and business optimization costs.
We believe the exclusion of such amounts allows management and the users of the financial statements to better understand our financial results.
Adjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP, and our use of the term Adjusted EBITDA may vary from the use of similarly-titled measures by others in our industry due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation.
36 We use Adjusted EBITDA to measure our performance from period to period both at the consolidated level as well as within our operating segments, to evaluate and fund incentive compensation programs and to compare our results to those of our competitors.
In addition to Adjusted EBITDA being a significant measure of performance for management purposes, we also believe that this presentation provides useful information to investors regarding financial and business trends related to our results of operations and that when non-GAAP financial information is viewed with GAAP financial information, investors are provided with a more meaningful understanding of our ongoing operating performance.
Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss, operating income, cash flows from operating activities or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or cash flows as measures of liquidity.
Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.
The below table presents a reconciliation from net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014: Year Ended December 31, (IN MILLIONS) 2016 2015 2014 Net income $ 507 $ 575 $ 381 Interest expense, net 329 307 297 Provision for income taxes 309 383 236 Depreciation and amortization 603 574 573 EBITDA 1,748 1,839 1,487 Equity in net loss of affiliates — 3 4 Other non-operating (income)/expense, net (2 ) (175 ) 171 Restructuring charges 105 51 89 Stock-based compensation expense 51 48 47 Other items(a) 36 92 39 Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,938 $ 1,858 $ 1,837 0 (a) For the year ended December 31, 2016, other items primarily consist of business optimization costs.

Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense was $603 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $574 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
This increase was primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization expense associated with assets acquired in business combinations and higher capital expenditures.
Depreciation and amortization expense associated with tangible and intangibles assets acquired in business combinations increased to $210 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $205 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

This increase is primarily due to higher average debt balances due to the incurrence of an additional $500 million in senior secured term loan in 2016 and higher USD LIBOR senior secured term loan interest rates.
Foreign Currency Exchange Transaction Losses, Net Foreign currency exchange transaction losses, net, represent the net loss on revaluation of certain cash, external debt, intercompany loans and other receivables and payables.
Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar, particularly the Euro, have a significant effect on our operating results.
The average U.S. Dollar to Euro exchange rate was $1.11 to €1.00 for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
We realized net losses of $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting primarily from fluctuations in certain foreign currencies associated with intercompany transactions and the loss of $5 million from the revaluation of our U.S.-denominated debt and cash held in EURO functional entities, partially offset by a gain of $1 million associated with foreign currency derivative financial instruments.
38 We realized net losses of $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting primarily from the revaluation of our U.S. denominated debt and cash held in Euro functional currency entities of $14 million, the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivars of $8 million as discussed in the “Foreign Currency” section of “Factors Affecting Nielsen’s Financial Results”, as well as the fluctuations in certain foreign currencies associated with intercompany transactions, partially offset by a gain of $2 million associated with foreign currency derivative financial instruments.

Other income, net of $206 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily related to the gains recorded from the step acquisition of NCS in the amount of $158 million, sale of an equity investment in the amount of $30 million and the disposition of NRG in the amount of $18 million.
Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Equity in Net Income of Affiliates Income was $816 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $961 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due primarily to the consolidated results mentioned above.
Income Taxes The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were 38% and 40%, respectively.
The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was higher than the UK statutory rate as a result of the impact of tax rate differences in other jurisdictions where the Company files tax returns, the effect of global licensing activities, withholding and foreign taxes as well as state and local income taxes, offset by the favorable impact of certain financing activities, windfall tax benefits from stock option exercises and releases of uncertain tax positions.
The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was higher than the UK statutory rate as a result of the impact of tax rate differences in other jurisdictions where the Company files tax returns, the effect of global licensing activities, withholding and foreign taxes as well as state and local income taxes, offset by the favorable impact of certain financing activities and foreign distributions.
At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had gross uncertain tax positions of $432 million and $461 million, respectively.
We also have accrued interest and penalties associated with these uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 of $33 million and $34 million, respectively.
Estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes is classified as a component of our provision or benefit for income taxes.
It is reasonably possible that a reduction in a range of $12 million to $20 million of uncertain tax positions may occur within the next twelve months as a result of projected resolutions of worldwide tax disputes.
Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where statutory rates are lower and earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where statutory rates are higher, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof.
Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.3% to $1,938 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $1,858 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, or 5.2% on a constant currency basis, excluding a 0.9% unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Business Segment Profitability We do not allocate items below operating income/(loss) to our business segments and therefore the tables below set forth a reconciliation of operating income/(loss) at the business segment level for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, adjusting for certain items affecting operating income/(loss), such as restructuring charges, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and certain other items described below resulting in a presentation of our non-GAAP business segment profitability.
Non-GAAP business segment profitability provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends related to our results of operations.
When this non-GAAP financial information is viewed with our GAAP financial information, investors are provided with a meaningful understanding of our ongoing operating performance.
It is important to note that the non-GAAP business segment profitability corresponds in total to our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA described within our consolidated results of operations above, which our chief operating decision making group and other members of management use to measure our performance from period to period both at the consolidated level as well as within our operating segments, to evaluate and fund incentive compensation programs and to compare our results to those of our competitors.
These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, cash flows from operating activities or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or cash flows as measures of liquidity.
These non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly-titled measures used by others and have important limitations as analytical tools.
Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.

Revenues from emerging markets decreased 7.9% to $1,044 million, or an increase of 8.5% on a constant currency basis, excluding a 16.4% unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, revenue growth was driven by broad-based demand for our services from both our multinational and local client bases with double-digit growth in Latin America, Africa, Middle East and Greater China.
Revenues from developed markets decreased 4.1% to $2,110 million, or an increase of 3.5% on a constant currency basis, excluding a 7.6% unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, revenue grew as a result of continued investments in products such as advanced analytics, segmentation and innovation as well as growth in our subscription-based products.

Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, revenue growth was driven by growth in Audience Measurement (video and text), which increased 3.1%, or 6.4% on a constant currency basis, due to the resilience in our core television audience measurement, our investments in eXelate and NCS, as well as our continued investment in digital.
Our Marketing Effectiveness offerings grew 16.7%, or 19.5% on a constant currency basis, as we continue to invest in the product portfolio while meeting the market’s growing demand for our Marketing ROI products.
However, this gain was partially offset by a decrease of 13.4%, or 9.7% on a constant currency basis, in our Corporate/Other Watch products as we continue to run off the legacy online rankings product and exit non-core media analytics products.
Our Core Watch services grew 3.9%, or 6.5% on a constant currency basis.
45 Business Segment Profitability We do not allocate items below operating income/(loss) to our business segments and therefore the tables below set forth a reconciliation of operating income/(loss) at the business segment level for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, adjusting for certain items affecting operating income/(loss), such as restructuring charges, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and certain other items described below resulting in a presentation of our non-GAAP business segment profitability.
Non-GAAP business segment profitability provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends related to our results of operations.
When this non-GAAP financial information is viewed with our GAAP financial information, investors are provided with a meaningful understanding of our ongoing operating performance.
It is important to note that the non-GAAP business segment profitability corresponds in total to our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA described within our consolidated results of operations above, which our chief operating decision making group and other members of management use to measure our performance from period to period both at the consolidated level as well as within our operating segments, to evaluate and fund incentive compensation programs and to compare our results to those of our competitors.
These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, cash flows from operating activities or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or cash flows as measures of liquidity.
These non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly-titled measures used by others and have important limitations as analytical tools.
Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.

Corporate Expenses and Eliminations Operating expenses were $156 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $105 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to increases in non-recurring costs outlined in the table above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows from operations provided a source of funds of $1,296 million, $1,209 million and $1,093 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
This increase was driven primarily by the Adjusted EBITDA performance discussed above and our focus on working capital management, partially offset by our $36 million cash contribution to the Nielsen Foundation during the year ended December 31, 2016 and higher interest payments during the year ended December 31, 2016 based on a higher debt balance and higher USD LIBOR senior secured term loan interest rates.
We provide for additional liquidity through several sources, including maintaining an adequate cash balance, access to global funding sources and a committed revolving credit facility.
The following table provides a summary of the major sources of liquidity for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014: (IN MILLIONS) 2016 2015 2014 Net cash from operating activities $ 1,296 $ 1,209 $ 1,093 Cash and short-term marketable securities $ 754 $ 357 $ 273 Revolving credit facility $ 575 $ 575 $ 575 Of the $754 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $515 million was held in jurisdictions outside the U.S. and as a result there may be tax consequences if such amounts were moved out of these jurisdictions or repatriated to the U.S. We regularly review the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. to determine the amounts necessary to fund the current operations of our foreign operations and their growth initiatives and amounts needed to service our U.S. indebtedness and related obligations.
The below table illustrates our weighted average interest rate and cash paid for interest over the last three years.

We believe we will have available resources to meet both our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, including our senior secured debt service.
We expect the cash flow from our operations, combined with existing cash and amounts available under the revolving credit facility, will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations, projected working capital requirements, restructuring obligations, dividend payments and capital spending over the next year.
In addition, we may, from time to time, purchase, repay, redeem or retire any of our outstanding debt securities (including any publicly issued debt securities) in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise.
47 Long-term borrowings The following table provides a summary of our outstanding long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2016: (IN MILLIONS) WeightedInterestRate CarryingAmount $2,080 million Senior secured term loan (LIBOR based variable rate of 2.65%) due 2019 $ 1,768 $1,900 million Senior secured term loan (LIBOR based variable rate of 3.15% ) due 2023 1,892 €380 million Senior secured term loan (Euro LIBOR based variable rate of 2.11%) due 2021 399 Total senior secured credit facilities (with weighted average interest rate) 2.95 % $ 4,059 $800 million 4.50% senior debenture loan due 2020 794 $625 million 5.50% senior debenture loan due 2021 618 $2,300 million 5.00% senior debenture loan due 2022 2,285 Total debenture loans (with weighted average interest rate) 5.22 % $ 3,697 Other loans 7 Total long-term debt 4.04 % $ 7,763 Capital lease and other financing obligations 158 Bank overdrafts 5 Total debt and other financing arrangements $ 7,926 Less: Current portion of long-term debt, capital lease and other financing obligations and other short-term borrowings 193 Non-current portion of long-term debt and capital lease and other financing obligations $ 7,733 Term Loan Facilities In April 2014, certain of our subsidiaries entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Agreement (the “Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”, and as subsequently amended, the “Amended Credit Agreement”).
The Amended Credit Agreement provides for term loan facilities as shown in the table above.
In March 2016, we entered into an amendment to our Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, providing for additional Class A Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million, maturing in full in April 2019 (the “Additional Class A Term Loans”).
The Additional Class A Term Loans are required to be repaid in quarterly installments ranging from 1.369% to 4.11% of the original principal amount (as may be reduced as a result of voluntary prepayments), with the balance payable on the maturity date.
The Additional Class A Term Loans bear interest equal to, at our election, a base rate or eurocurrency rate, in each case plus an applicable margin which ranges from 0.50% to 1.25% (in the case of base rate loans) or 1.50% to 2.25% (in the case of eurocurrency rate loans).
The specific applicable margin is determined by our total leverage ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement).
This amendment was accounted for as a modification of the Amended Credit Agreement.
In October 2016, we entered into a second amendment to our Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, providing for (i) an incremental facility of Class B-2 Euro Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of €380 million, the proceeds of which were used to replace or refinance the existing Class B-2 Euro Term Loans and to repay certain other indebtedness, and (ii) a new class of term loans, Class B-3 Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of $1,900 million, the proceeds of which were used to replace or refinance in full a like amount of our applicable existing Class B-1 Term Loans that were maturing in May 2017 and Class B-2 Dollar Term Loans that were maturing in April 2021 and to repay certain other indebtedness.
The incremental Class B-2 Euro Term Loans will mature in full in April 2021 and are required to be repaid in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1.00% of the original principal amount of incremental Class B-2 Euro Term Loans, with the balance payable in April 2021.
The Class B-3 Term Loans will mature in full in October 2023 and are required to be repaid in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1.00% of the original principal amount of Class B-3 Term Loans, with the balance payable in October 2023.
48 Class B-2 Euro Term Loans will bear interest equal to the Eurocurrency rate plus an applicable margin, which is equal to 2.50%.
Class B-3 Term Loans bear interest equal to, at our election, a base rate or eurocurrency rate plus an applicable margin, which is equal to 2.50% (in the case of eurocurrency loans) or 1.50% (in the case of base rate loans).
This amendment was accounted for as a modification of the Amended Credit Agreement.
The Amended Credit Agreement contains the same affirmative and negative covenants as those of the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement prior to the 2016 amendments.
Obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are guaranteed by TNC B.V., substantially all of the wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries of TNC B.V. and certain of the non-U.S. wholly-owned subsidiaries of TNC B.V., and are secured by substantially all of the existing and future property and assets of the U.S. subsidiaries of TNC B.V. and by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of the guarantors, the capital stock of substantially all of the U.S. subsidiaries of TNC B.V., and up to 65% of the capital stock of certain of the non-U.S. subsidiaries of TNC B.V.
Under a separate security agreement, substantially all of the assets of TNC B.V. are pledged as collateral for amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement.
Covenants The Amended Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of Nielsen Holding and Finance B.V. and its restricted subsidiaries (which together constitute most of our subsidiaries) to incur additional indebtedness or guarantees, incur liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions, make certain loans and investments, declare dividends, make payments or redeem or repurchase capital stock, engage in certain mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations, prepay, redeem or purchase certain indebtedness, amend or otherwise alter terms of certain indebtedness, sell certain assets, transact with affiliates, enter into agreements limiting subsidiary distributions and alter the business they conduct.
These entities are restricted, subject to certain exceptions, in their ability to transfer their net assets to us.
Such restricted net assets amounted to approximately $4.2 billion at December 31, 2016.
In addition, these entities are subject to a total leverage covenant.
The leverage ratio requires that we not permit the ratio of total net debt (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) at the end of any calendar quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) for the four quarters then ended to exceed a specified threshold.
The maximum permitted ratio is 5.50 to 1.00.
Neither we nor TNC B.V. is currently bound by any financial or negative covenants contained in the Amended Credit Agreement.
The Amended Credit Agreement also contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default.
Certain significant financial covenants are described further below.
Failure to comply with this financial covenant would result in an event of default under our Amended Credit Agreement unless waived by certain of our term lenders and our revolving lenders.
An event of default under our Amended Credit Agreement can result in the acceleration of our indebtedness under the facilities, which in turn would result in an event of default and possible acceleration of indebtedness under the agreements governing our debt securities as well.
As our failure to comply with the financial covenant described above can cause us to go into default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, management believes that our Amended Credit Agreement and this covenant are material to us.
As of December 31, 2016, we were in full compliance with the financial covenant described above.
Pursuant to our Amended Credit Agreement, we are subject to making mandatory prepayments on the term loans within our Amended Credit Agreement to the extent in any full calendar year we generate Excess Cash Flow (“ECF”), as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement.
The percentage of ECF that must be applied as a repayment is a function of several factors, including our ratio of total net debt to Covenant EBITDA, as well other adjustments, including any voluntary term loan repayments made in the course of the calendar year.
To the extent any mandatory repayment is required pursuant to this ECF clause; such payment must generally occur on or around the time of the delivery of the annual consolidated financial statements to the lenders.
At December 31, 2016, our ratio of total net debt to Covenant EBITDA was less than 5.00 to 1.00 and therefore no mandatory repayment was required.
Our next ECF measurement date will occur upon completion of the 2017 results, and although we do not expect to be required to issue any mandatory repayments in 2018 or beyond, it is uncertain at this time if any such payments will be required in future periods.
Revolving Credit Facility The Amended Credit Agreement also contains a senior secured revolving credit facility under which Nielsen Finance LLC, TNC (US) Holdings, Inc., and Nielsen Holding and Finance B.V. can borrow revolving loans.
The revolving credit facility can also be used for letters of credit, guarantees and swingline loans.
The existing revolving credit facility has commitments of $575 million with a final maturity of April 2019.
49 The senior secured revolving credit facility is provided under the Amended Credit Agreement and so contains covenants and restrictions as noted under the “Term loan facilities” section above.
Obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by the same entities that guarantee obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement and Senior Secured Loan Agreement.
As of December 31, 2016, we had zero borrowings outstanding and outstanding letters of credit of $6 million.
As of December 31, 2015, we had $164 million of borrowings outstanding and outstanding letters of credit of $7 million.
As of December 31, 2016, we had $569 million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility.
Debenture Loans The indentures governing certain of our debenture loans limit the majority of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase our capital stock, make certain investments, enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, use assets as security in other transactions and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies subject to certain exceptions.
Upon a change in control, we are required to make an offer to redeem all of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to the 101% of the aggregate accreted principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.
The Senior Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by Nielsen Holdings plc, substantially all of the wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries of Nielsen Holdings plc, and certain of the non-U.S. wholly-owned subsidiaries of Nielsen Holdings plc.
Subsequent Event In January 2017, we completed the issuance of $500 million aggregated principal amount of 5.0% Senior Notes due 2025 at par, with cash proceeds of approximately $495 million, net of fees and expenses.
Dividends and Share Repurchase Program We remain committed to driving shareholder value as evidenced in 2013 with the adoption of a quarterly cash dividend policy by our board of directors, under which we have paid $434 million and $408 million in cash dividends during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will be subject to the board’s continuing determination that the dividend policy and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders, and are in compliance with all laws and agreements to which we are subject.
The below table summarizes the dividends declared on our common stock during 2015 and 2016.

The dividend is payable on March 16, 2017 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 2, 2017.
Our Board approved a share repurchase program, as included in the below table, for up to $2 billion of our outstanding common stock.
The primary purpose of the program is to return value to shareholders and to mitigate dilution associated with our equity compensation plans.

This program has been executed within the limitations of the existing authority granted at our Annual General Meeting of Shareholders held in 2014, 2015 and 2016.
As of December 31, 2016, there have been 33,837,526 shares of our common stock purchased at an average price of $46.16 per share (total consideration of approximately $1,562 million) under this program.

This increase was driven primarily by the Adjusted EBITDA performance discussed above and our focus on working capital management, partially offset by our $36 million cash contribution to the Nielsen Foundation during the year ended December 31, 2016 and higher interest payments during the year ended December 31, 2016 based on a higher debt balance and higher USD LIBOR senior secured term loan interest rates.
Our key collections performance measure, days billing outstanding (DBO), decreased by 3 days for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to a 1 day increase for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Investing activities.
Net cash used in investing activities was $642 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $581 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
The increase was primarily driven by increased acquisition payments and capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015. Financing activities.
Net cash used in financing activities was $248 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $492 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
The decrease in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to lower share repurchasing, as described in the “Dividends and Share Repurchase Program” section above, and increased net proceeds from the issuance and repayment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period of 2015, partially offset by higher dividend payments, as described in the “Dividends and Share Repurchase Program” section above, and an increase in capital lease financing during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period of 2015.
Cash Flows 2015 versus 2014 Operating activities.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,209 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $1,093 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
This increase was driven by the Adjusted EBITDA performance described above, and improved working capital performance on the timing of customer and vendor payments.
Our key collections performance measure, days billing outstanding (DBO), was flat for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a 1 day increase for the year ended December 31, 2014.
51 Investing activities.
Net cash used in investing activities was $581 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $732 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
The decrease was primarily driven by decreased acquisition payments during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014 and proceeds received from the sale of an equity investment and a subsidiary during the year ended December 31, 2015. Financing activities.
Net cash used in financing activities was $492 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $585 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
The decrease in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to increased net proceeds from the issuance and repayment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, partially offset by the higher share repurchasing and dividend payments, as described in the “Dividends and Share Repurchase Program” section above, during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014.
Capital Expenditures Investments in property, plant, equipment, software and other assets totaled $433 million, $408 million and $412 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
In addition, the Company received $42 million and $7 million of proceeds from the sale of certain property, plant and equipment and other assets during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Commitments and Contingencies Outsourced Services Agreements In February 2013, we amended our Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement (the “MSA”), dated as of October 1, 2007, with Tata America International Corporation and Tata Consultancy Services Limited (jointly, “TCS”).
The term of the MSA has been extended for an additional three years, so as to expire on December 31, 2020, with a one-year renewal option granted to Nielsen.
In addition, we have increased our commitment to purchase services from TCS (the “Minimum Commitment”) from $1.0 billion to $2.5 billion over the life of the contract (from October 1, 2007), including a commitment to purchase at least $100 million in services per year until calendar year 2020 when the per year commitment is reduced to $75 million, (the “Annual Commitment”).
We met the Minimum Commitment in 2016.
TCS’ charges under the separate Global Infrastructure Services Agreement between the parties will be credited against the Minimum Commitment and the Annual Commitment.
TCS will globally provide us with professional services relating to information technology (including application development and maintenance), business process outsourcing, client service knowledge process outsourcing, measurement sciences, analytics, and financial planning and analytics.
As we order specific services under the Agreement, the parties will execute Statements of Work (“SOWs”) describing the specific scope of the services to be performed by TCS.
The amount of the Minimum Commitment and the Annual Commitment may be reduced on the occurrence of certain events, some of which also provide us with the right to terminate the Agreement or SOWs, as applicable.
Nielsen Foundation, Inc.
In November 2015, we established the Nielsen Foundation, Inc. (the “Foundation”) for charitable, educational, scientific, and literary purposes including the making of distributions to organizations that qualify as tax exempt organizations under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
The assets and transactions of the Foundation are not included in our consolidated financial statements.
Donations to the Foundation are expensed when committed by us.
In December 2015, our board of directors approved an unconditional donation of $36 million to the Foundation, at which time it was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.
In March 2016, we paid the cash contribution to the Foundation.
Other Contractual Obligations Our other contractual obligations include capital lease obligations (including interest portion), facility leases, leases of certain computer and other equipment, agreements to purchase data and telecommunication services, the payment of principal and interest on debt and pension fund obligations.
52 At December 31, 2016, the minimum annual payments under these agreements and other contracts that had initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year are as listed in the following table.
Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2016, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of any potential cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities.
Therefore, $465 million of unrecognized tax benefits (which includes interest and penalties of $33 million) have been excluded from the contractual obligations table below.
See Note 14 – “Income Taxes” – to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes.

(b) Our operating lease obligations are described in Note 16 – “Commitments and Contingencies” – to our consolidated financial statements.
(c) Other contractual obligations represent obligations under agreements, which are not unilaterally cancelable by us, are legally enforceable and specify fixed or minimum amounts or quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices.
We generally require purchase orders for vendor and third party spending.
The amounts presented above represent the minimum future annual services covered by purchase obligations including data processing, building maintenance, equipment purchasing, photocopiers, land and mobile telephone service, computer software and hardware maintenance, and outsourcing.
Our remaining commitments as of December 31, 2016, under the outsourced services agreement with TCS have been included above based on the Annual Commitment minimum required payments.
(d) Interest payments consist of interest on both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt based on LIBOR as of December 31, 2016.
(e) Our contributions to pension and other post-retirement defined benefit plans were $21 million, $25 million and $35 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Future minimum pension and other post-retirement benefits contributions are not determinable for time periods after 2017.
See Note 10 – “Pensions and Other Post-Retirement Benefits” – to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion on plan obligations.
Guarantees and Other Contingent Commitments At December 31, 2016, we were committed under the following significant guarantee arrangements: Sub-lease guarantees.
We provide sub-lease guarantees in accordance with certain agreements pursuant to which we guarantee
 all rental payments upon default of rental payment by the sub-lessee.
To date, we have not been required to perform under such arrangements, and do not anticipate making any significant payments related to such guarantees and, accordingly, no amounts have been recorded.
Letters of credit.
Letters of credit issued and outstanding amount to $6 million at December 31, 2016.
Legal Proceedings and Contingencies We are subject to litigation and other claims in the ordinary course of business, some of which include claims for substantial sums.
Accruals have been recorded when the outcome is probable and can be reasonably estimated.
While the ultimate results of claims and litigation cannot be determined, we expect that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition.
However, depending on the amount and the timing, an unfavorable resolution of some or all of these matters could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.
53 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Except as disclosed above, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that currently have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditure or capital resources.
Summary of Recent Accounting Pronouncements Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”), “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”.
The new revenue recognition standard provides a five step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized.
The new model will require revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services and shall be applied retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.
This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
In 2014, we established a cross-functional implementation team consisting of representatives from across all of our business segments.
We utilized a bottoms-up approach to analyze the impact of the standard on our contract portfolio by reviewing our current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that would result from applying the requirements of the new standard to our revenue contracts.
In addition, we identified, and are in the process of implementing appropriate changes to our business processes, systems and controls to support the recognition and disclosure under the new standard.
Based on our preliminary assessment, we do not believe the adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
We are continuing to assess which transition method we will use to adopt this ASU.
Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments In January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU, “Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”.
The new standard was issued to amend the guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
The new standard significantly revises an entity's accounting related to the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value.
The new standard also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments.
The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.
Early adoption for most of the provisions is not allowed.
We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements.
Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU, “Leases”.
The new standard amends the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases currently classified as operating leases and amends disclosure requirements associated with leasing arrangements.
The new standard increases assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.
The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.
Early adoption is permitted.
The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition, and provides for certain practical expedients.
Transition will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented.
We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements.
Investments- Equity Method and Joint Ventures In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU, “Investments- Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting”.
This new standard eliminates the requirement to apply the equity method of accounting retrospectively when a reporting entity obtains significant influence over a previously held investment.
This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.
Under the provisions of this ASU, when circumstances dictate that an investment accounted for under the cost method should no longer be a cost method investee but be accounted for under the equity method, there will no longer be a required retrospective restatement.
We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements.
Compensation- Stock Compensation In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting”.
The new standard simplifies several aspects related to the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, statutory tax withholding requirements, forfeitures and classification on the statement of cash flows.
This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016; however, early adoption is permitted.
We elected to early adopt this ASU and as a result recorded a $47 million 54 cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2016 related to previously unrecognized excess tax benefits.
During 2016 we recorded $19 million of excess tax benefits to the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations.
Further, we elected to apply the retrospective transition method to the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows.
This change resulted in a $30 million increase to operating cash flow and a $30 million decrease to cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses In June 2016, the FASB issued an ASU, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”.
The standard significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income.
The standard will replace today’s “incurred loss” approach with an “expected loss” model for instruments measured at amortized cost.
For available-for-sale debt securities, entities will be required to record allowances rather than reduce the carrying amount, as they do today under the other-than-temporary impairment model.
It also simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans.
The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.
Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.
We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements.
Statement of Cash Flows – Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows- Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments”.
The standard addresses how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash flow, and other Topics.
ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2017.
We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Business Combinations In January 2017, the FASB issued ASC 2017-01, “Business Combinations (Topic 805), Clarifying the Definition of a Business”.
The updated standard provides guidance to assist entities with evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business.
Under the new guidance, an entity first determines whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets.
If this threshold is met, the set is not a business.
If it is not met, the entity then evaluates whether the set meets the requirements that a business include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs.
The updated guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those years.
The ASU will be applied prospectively to any transaction occurring within the period of adoption.
Early adoption is permitted, including for interim and annual periods in which the financial statements have not been issued or made available for issuances.
We elected to early adopt the ASU effective October 1, 2016.
There was no impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and market prices such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and changes in the market value of equity instruments.
We are exposed to market risk, primarily related to foreign exchange and interest rates.
We actively monitor these exposures.
Historically, in order to manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we entered into a variety of derivative financial instruments, mainly interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and forward rate agreements.
Currently we only employ basic contracts, that is, without options, embedded or otherwise.
Our objective is to reduce, where it is deemed appropriate to do so, fluctuations in earnings, cash flows and the value of our net investments in subsidiaries resulting from changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates.
It is our policy not to trade in financial instruments.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We operate globally and we predominantly generate revenues and expenses in local currencies.
Because of fluctuations (including possible devaluations) in currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into our reporting currency, we are subject to currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations, in addition to transaction exposure.
55 For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded a net gain of $1 million and $2 million, respectively, associated with foreign currency derivative financial instruments within foreign currency exchange transactions losses, net in our consolidated statements of operations.
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency derivative financial instruments were $77 million and $37 million, respectively.
The table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by currency for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: U.S.
Dollars Euro Other Currencies Year ended December 31, 2016 Revenues 61 % 9 % 30 % Operating costs 57 % 10 % 33 % Year ended December 31, 2015 Revenues 60 % 9 % 31 % Operating costs 57 % 10 % 33 % Based on the year ended December 31, 2016, a one cent change in the U.S. dollar/Euro exchange rate would have impacted revenues by approximately $5 million annually, with an immaterial impact on operating income.
Interest Rate Risk We continually review our fixed and variable rate debt along with related hedging opportunities in order to ensure our portfolio is appropriately balanced as part of our overall interest rate risk management strategy and through this process we consider both short-term and long-term considerations in the U.S. and global financial markets in making adjustments to our tolerable exposures to interest rate risk.
At December 31, 2016, we had $4,059 million of floating-rate debt under our senior secured credit facilities, of which $1,050 million was subject to effective floating-fixed interest rate swaps.
A one percent increase in interest rates applied to our floating rate indebtedness would therefore increase annual interest expense by approximately $30 million ($41 million without giving effect to any of our interest rate swaps).
In June 2016, we entered into $250 million in aggregate notional amount of a three-year forward interest rate swap agreement with a starting date of June 9, 2016.
This agreement fixes the LIBOR-related portion of interest rates of a corresponding amount of our variable-rate debt at an average rate of 0.86%.
This derivative instrument has been designated as an interest rate cash flow hedge.
In July 2015, we entered into a $150 million in notional amount of three-year forward interest rate swap agreement with a starting date in July 2016.
This agreement fixes the LIBOR-related portion of the interest rates of a corresponding amount of our variable-rate debt at an average rate of 1.62%.
This derivative instrument has been designated as an interest rate cash flow hedge.
In April 2015, we entered into a $150 million in notional amount of three-year forward interest rate swap agreement with a starting date in April 2016.
This agreement fixes the LIBOR-related portion of the interest rates of a corresponding amount of our variable-rate debt at an average rate of 1.40%.
This derivative instrument has been designated as an interest rate cash flow hedge.
In November 2014, we entered into a $250 million in notional amount of two-year forward interest swap agreement with a starting date in May 2016.
This agreement fixes the LIBOR-related portion of the interest rate of a corresponding amount of the Company’s variable-rate debt at an average rate of 1.78%.
This derivative instrument has been designated as interest rate cash flow hedge.
In November 2014, we entered into a $250 million in notional amount of two-year forward interest swap agreement with a starting date in September 2015.
This agreement fixes the LIBOR-related portion of the interest rate of a corresponding amount of the Company’s variable-rate debt at an average rate of 1.26%.
This derivative instrument has been designated as interest rate cash flow hedge.
Derivative instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of non-performance, or credit risk.
We do not believe that we currently face a significant risk of loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties associated with these instruments, as these transactions were executed with a diversified group of major financial institutions with a minimum investment-grade or better credit rating.
Our credit risk exposure is managed through the continuous monitoring of our exposures to such counterparties.

/s/ Dwight M. Barns /s/ Jamere Jackson Dwight M. Barns Jamere Jackson Chief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer February 17, 2017 58 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Board and Stockholders of Nielsen Holdings plc We have audited Nielsen Holdings plc’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
Nielsen Holdings plc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Nielsen Holdings plc’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Nielsen Holding plc maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Nielsen Holding plc as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income/(loss), changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 of Nielsen Holdings plc and our report dated February 17, 2017, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
/s/ Ernst & Young LLP New York, New York February 17, 2017 59 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board and Stockholders of Nielsen Holdings plc We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Nielsen Holdings plc as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income/(loss), changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016.
Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 8.
These financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of Nielsen Holdings plc’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Nielsen Holdings plc at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Nielsen Holdings plc’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 17, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

67 Nielsen Holding plc Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies Nielsen, together with its subsidiaries, is a leading global information and measurement company that provides clients with a comprehensive understanding of consumers and consumer behavior.
Nielsen is aligned into two reportable segments: what consumers buy (“Buy”), what consumers watch and listen to (“Watch”).
Nielsen has a presence in more than 100 countries, with its headquarters located in Oxford, the United Kingdom and New York, USA.
See Note 17 – “Segments” for a discussion of the Company’s reportable segments.
On August 31, 2015, Nielsen N.V., a Dutch public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, merged with Nielsen Holdings plc, by way of a cross-border merger under the European Cross-Border Merger Directive, with Nielsen Holdings plc being the surviving company (the “Merger”).
The Merger effectively changed the place of incorporation of Nielsen’s publically traded parent holding company from the Netherlands to England and Wales, with no changes made to the business being conducted by Nielsen prior to the Merger.
Due to the fact that the Merger was a business combination between entities under common control, the exchange of assets and liabilities were made at carrying value.
Therefore, there were no direct accounting implications in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Nielsen, together with its subsidiaries, is a leading global information and measurement company that provides clients with a comprehensive understanding of consumers and consumer behavior.
Nielsen is aligned into two reportable segments: what consumers buy (“Buy”), what consumers watch and listen to (“Watch”).
Nielsen has a presence in more than 100 countries, with its headquarters located in Oxford, the United Kingdom and New York, USA.
See Note 17 – “Segments” for a discussion of the Company’s reportable segments.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
All amounts are presented in U.S.
Dollars (“$”), except for share and per share data or where expressly stated as being in other currencies, e.g., Euros (“€”).
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Nielsen and all subsidiaries and other controlled entities.
Supplemental cash flows from discontinued operations are presented in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements “Discontinued Operations.” The Company has evaluated events occurring subsequent to December 31, 2016 for potential recognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements and concluded there were no subsequent events that required recognition or disclosure other than those provided.
Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Nielsen and all subsidiaries and other controlled entities.
Noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries are reported as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements with disclosure on the face of the consolidated statements of operations of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to Nielsen stockholders and to the noncontrolling interests.
The equity method of accounting is used for investments in affiliates and joint ventures where Nielsen has significant influence but not control, usually supported by a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
Investments in which Nielsen owns less than 20% and does not have significant influence are accounted for either as available-for-sale securities if the shares are publicly traded or as cost method investments.
Intercompany accounts and transactions between consolidated companies have been eliminated in consolidation.
Foreign Currency Translation Nielsen has significant investments outside the United States, primarily in the Euro-zone, Canada and the United Kingdom.
Therefore, changes in the value of foreign currencies affect the consolidated financial statements when translated into U.S.
Dollars.
The functional currency for substantially all subsidiaries outside the U.S. is the local currency.
Financial statements for these subsidiaries are translated into U.S.
Dollars at period-end exchange rates as to the assets and liabilities and monthly average exchange rates as to revenues, expenses and cash flows.
For these countries, currency translation adjustments are recognized in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), net, whereas transaction gains and losses are recognized in foreign exchange transaction losses, net in the consolidated statement of operations.
68 Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Research and Development Costs Research and development costs, which were not material for any periods presented, are expensed as incurred.
Revenue Recognition Nielsen recognizes revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered or information has been delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable and the collectability of the related revenue is reasonably assured.
A significant portion of the Company’s revenue is generated from information (primarily retail measurement and consumer panel services) and measurement (primarily from television, radio, online and mobile audiences) services.
The Company generally recognizes revenue from the sale of services as the services are performed, which is usually ratably over the term of the contract(s).
Invoiced amounts are recorded as deferred revenue until earned.
Substantially all of the Company’s customer contracts are non-cancellable and non-refundable.
Certain of the Company’s revenue arrangements include multiple deliverables and in these arrangements, the individual deliverables within the contract that have stand-alone value to the customer are separated and recognized upon delivery based upon the Company’s best estimate of their selling prices.
These arrangements are not significant to the Company’s results of operations.
In certain cases, software is included as part of these arrangements to allow Nielsen’s customers to view delivered information and is provided for the term of the arrangement and is not significant to the marketing effort and is not sold separately.
Accordingly, software provided to Nielsen’s customers is considered to be incidental to the arrangements and is not recognized as a separate element.
A discussion of Nielsen’s revenue recognition policies, by segment, follows: Buy Revenue from the Buy segment, primarily from retail measurement services and consumer panel services is recognized over the period during which the services are performed and information is delivered to the customer, primarily on a straight-line basis.
The Company provides insights and solutions to customers through analytical studies that are recognized into revenue as value is delivered to the customer.
The pattern of revenue recognition for these contracts varies depending on the terms of the individual contracts, and may be recognized proportionally or deferred until the end of the contract term and recognized when the information has been delivered to the customer.
Watch Revenue from the Watch segment is primarily generated from television, radio, online and mobile measurement services and recognized over the contract period, as the service is delivered to the customer, primarily on a straight-line basis.
Deferred Costs Incremental direct costs incurred related to establishing or significantly expanding a panel in a designated market and costs incurred to build the infrastructure to service new clients, are deferred at the point when Nielsen determines them to be recoverable.
Prior to this point, these cost are expensed as incurred.
These deferred costs are typically amortized through cost of revenues over the original contract period beginning when the panel or infrastructure to service new clients is ready for its intended use.
Advertising and Marketing Costs Advertising and marketing costs are expensed as incurred and are reflected as selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
These costs include all brand advertising, telemarketing, direct mail and other sales promotion associated with marketing/media research services.
Advertising and marketing costs totaled $25 million, $19 million and $19 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
69 Computation of Net Income per Share Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and dilutive potential shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Dilutive potential shares of common stock primarily consist of employee stock options and restricted stock.
Employee stock options, restricted stock and similar equity instruments granted by the Company are treated as potential common stock outstanding in computing diluted earnings per share.
Diluted stock outstanding include restricted stock units and the dilutive effect of in-the-money options which is calculated based on the average share price for each period using the treasury stock method.
Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options, the amount of compensation cost for future service that the Company has not yet recognized, and in 2014 and 2015 the amount of benefits that would be recorded in additional paid-in capital when the award becomes deductible for tax purposes are assumed to be used to repurchase stock.
In 2016, upon the adoption of ASU 2016-09, “Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting”, the Company removed the excess tax benefit from its assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method.
The two-class method is an earnings allocation method for computing earnings/(loss) per share when a company’s capital structure includes either two or more classes of common stock or common stock and participating securities.
This method determines earnings/(loss) per share based on dividends declared on common stock and participating securities (i.e., distributed earnings), as well as participation rights of participating securities in any undistributed earnings.
The two-class method did not have a significant impact on the calculation or presentation of earnings per share for any of the periods presented.
The effect of 1,650,708, 1,593,807 and 2,437,100 shares of common stock equivalents under stock compensation plans were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, as such shares would have been anti-dilutive.
Comprehensive Income/(Loss) Comprehensive income/(loss) is reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income/(loss) and consists of net income and other gains and losses, net of tax affecting equity that are excluded from net income.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity date of three months or less.
Cash and cash equivalents are carried at fair value.
Accounts Receivable The Company extends non-interest bearing trade credit to its customers in the ordinary course of business.
To minimize credit risk, ongoing credit evaluations of client’s financial condition are performed.
An estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable or returns are expected.
During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company sold $137 million and $50 million, respectively, of accounts receivables to a third party and recorded an immaterial loss on the sale to interest expense, net in the consolidated statement of operations.
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, $71 million and $50 million, respectively, remained outstanding.
The sale was accounted for as a true sale, without recourse.
We maintain servicing responsibilities of the receivables, for which the related costs are not significant.
The proceeds of $137 million and $50 million from the sale were reported as a component of the changes in trade and other receivables, net within operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
70 Other Significant Accounting Policies The following table includes other significant accounting policies that are described in other notes to the financial statements, including the related note: Significant Accounting Policy Note Investments 8 Financial Instruments 8 Derivative Financial Instruments 8 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 5 Property, Plant and Equipment 7 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 5&7 Pensions and Other Post Retirement Benefits 10 Stock-Based Compensation 13 Income Taxes 14 2.
Summary of Recent Accounting Pronouncements Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”), “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”.
The new revenue recognition standard provides a five step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized.
The new model will require revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services and shall be applied retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.
This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
In 2014, the Company established a cross-functional implementation team consisting of representatives from across all of its business segments.
Management utilized a bottoms-up approach to analyze the impact of the standard on our contract portfolio by reviewing the current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that would result from applying the requirements of the new standard to our revenue contracts.
In addition, management identified, and are in the process of implementing appropriate changes to our business processes, systems and controls to support the recognition and disclosure under the new standard.
Based on management’s preliminary assessment, it does not believe the adoption of this ASU will have a material impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
The Company is continuing to assess which transition method it will use to adopt this ASU.
Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments In January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU, “Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”.
The new standard was issued to amend the guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
The new standard significantly revises an entity's accounting related to the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value.
The new standard also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments.
The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.
Early adoption for most of the provisions is not allowed.
Nielsen is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this ASU will have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU, “Leases”.
The new standard amends the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases currently classified as operating leases and amends disclosure requirements associated with leasing arrangements.
The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.
Early adoption is permitted.
The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition, and provides for certain practical expedients.
Transition will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented.
While Nielsen continues to assess the impact of the adoption of this ASU will have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, Nielsen expects it will increase assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
71 Investments- Equity Method and Joint Ventures In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU, “Investments- Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting”.
This new standard eliminates the requirement to apply the equity method of accounting retrospectively when a reporting entity obtains significant influence over a previously held investment.
This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.
Under the provisions of this ASU, when circumstances dictate that an investment accounted for under the cost method should no longer be a cost method investee but be accounted for under the equity method, there will no longer be a required retrospective restatement.
Nielsen is currently assessing the impact of the adoption this ASU will have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Compensation- Stock Compensation In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting”.
The new standard simplifies several aspects related to the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, statutory tax withholding requirements, forfeitures and classification on the statement of cash flows.
This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016; however, early adoption is permitted.
Nielsen elected to early adopt this ASU and as a result recorded a $47 million cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2016 related to previously unrecognized excess tax benefits
 During 2016, Nielsen recorded $19 million of excess tax benefits to the provision for income taxes in its consolidated statement of operations.
Further, the Company elected to apply the retrospective transition method to the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows.
This change resulted in a $30 million increase to operating cash flow and a $30 million decrease to cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses In June 2016, the FASB issued an ASU, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”.
The standard significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income.
The standard will replace today’s “incurred loss” approach with an “expected loss” model for instruments measured at amortized cost.
For available-for-sale debt securities, entities will be required to record allowances rather than reduce the carrying amount, as they do today under the other-than-temporary impairment model.
It also simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans.
The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.
Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.
Nielsen is currently assessing the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Statement of Cash Flows– Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows- Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments”.
The standard addresses how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash flow, and other Topics.
ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2017.
Nielsen does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Business Combinations In January 2017, the FASB issued ASC 2017-01, “Business Combinations (Topic 805), Clarifying the Definition of a Business”.
The updated standard provides guidance to assist entities with evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business.
Under the new guidance, an entity first determines whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets.
If this threshold is met, the set is not a business.
If it is not met, the entity than evaluates whether the set meets the requirements that a business include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs.
The updated guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those years.
The ASU will be applied prospectively to any transaction occurring within the period of adoption.
Early adoption is permitted, including for interim and annual periods in which the financial statements have not been issued or made available for issuances.
Nielsen elected to early adopt the ASU effective October 1, 2016.
There was no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
72 3. Business Acquisitions For the year ended December 31, 2016, Nielsen paid cash consideration of $285 million associated with both current period and previously executed acquisitions, net of cash acquired.
Had these current period’s acquisitions occurred as of January 1, 2016, the impact on Nielsen’s consolidated results of operations would not have been material.
For the year ended December 31, 2015, Nielsen paid cash consideration of $246 million associated with both current period and previously executed acquisitions, net of cash acquired.
Included in this amount is $45 million for an additional 13.5% interest in Nielsen Catalina Solutions (“NCS”), a joint venture between us and Catalina that we historically accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
As part of this transaction Nielsen gained control of NCS and, as such accounted for it as a step-acquisition and calculated the fair value of the investment immediately before the acquisition to be $161 million.
The fair value of the investment was calculated by an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires the use of various assumptions, including expectations of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and tax rates in developing the present value of future cash flows.
As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2015, Nielsen recorded a $158 million gain on the investment in NCS to other income/(expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations.
Commencing October 1, 2015, NCS was reflected as a consolidated subsidiary within Nielsen’s consolidated financial statements.
Had these current period’s acquisitions occurred as of January 1, 2015, the impact on Nielsen’s consolidated results of operations would not have been material.
For the year ended December 31, 2014, Nielsen paid cash consideration of $314 million associated with both current period and previously executed acquisitions, net of cash acquired.
Had that period’s acquisitions occurred as of January 1, 2014, the impact on Nielsen’s consolidated results of operations would not have been material.
Subsequent Event Gracenote In February 2017, Nielsen completed the acquisition of Gracenote, through the purchase of 100% of Gracenote’s outstanding common stock for a total cash purchase price of $560 million.
Nielsen acquired the data and technology that underpins the programming guides and personalized user experience for major video, music, audio and sports content.
The acquisition extends Nielsen’s footprint with major clients by including Gracenote’s global content database which spans across platforms including multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs), smart televisions, streaming music services, connected devices, media players and in-car infotainment systems.
Gracenote will consolidate into Nielsen’s Watch segment.
This Acquisition will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires, among other things, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date.
The Company is in the process of preparing the initial accounting of the transaction and expects to establish a preliminary purchase price allocation by the end of the first quarter of 2017.

Discontinued Operations and Other Dispositions In December 2016, Nielsen completed the sale of Claritas, a business focusing on consumer segmentation insights within the Company’s Buy segment, for cash consideration of $34 million and a note receivable for $60 million.
The note is payable at any time over three years and bears interest at 3% in year one, 5% in year two and 7% in year three.
As a result of this transaction, the Company recorded a $14 million gain on the sale to other income/(expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations.
This disposition did not qualify to be classified as a discontinued operations.
In November 2015, Nielsen completed the sale of the National Research Group, Inc., a leader in providing market research to movie studios within the Company’s Watch segment, for total cash consideration of $34 million and recorded an $18 million gain on the sale to other income/(expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations.
This disposition did not qualify to be classified as a discontinued operations.
In February 2014, Nielsen completed the acquisition of Harris Interactive, Inc., a leading global market research firm, through the purchase of all outstanding shares of Harris Interactive’s common stock for $2.04 per share.
In June 2014, the Company completed the sale of Harris Interactive European operations (“Harris Europe”) to ITWP Acquisitions Limited (“ITWP”), the parent company of Toluna, a leading digital market research and technology company in exchange for a minority stake in ITWP.
The consolidated statements of operations reflect the operating results of Harris Europe as a discontinued operation.
73 Summarized results of operations for discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 is as follows: (IN MILLIONS) 2014 Revenue $ 15 Operating income — Interest expense — Income from operations before income taxes — Provision for income taxes — Income from operations — Net income/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests — Gain on sale, net of tax — Income from discontinued operations $ — There were no discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting of certain trade names and trademarks, are each tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable.
Nielsen has designated October 1st as the date in which the annual assessment is performed as this timing corresponds with the development of the Company’s formal budget and business plan review.
Nielsen reviews the recoverability of its goodwill by comparing the estimated fair values of reporting units with their respective carrying amounts.
The Company established, and continues to evaluate, its reporting units based on its internal reporting structure and defines such reporting units at its operating segment level or one level below.
The estimates of fair value of a reporting unit are determined using a combination of valuation techniques, primarily an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis supplemented by a market-based approach.
A discounted cash flow analysis requires the use of various assumptions, including expectations of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and tax rates in developing the present value of future cash flow projections.
The market-based approach utilizes available market comparisons such as indicative industry multiples that are applied to current year revenue and earnings as well as recent comparable transactions.
The Company’s 2016, 2015 and 2014 annual assessments did not result in an impairment for goodwill.
Goodwill is stated at historical cost less accumulated impairments losses, if any.
The table below summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
(IN MILLIONS) Buy Watch Total Balance, December 31, 2014 $ 3,014 $ 4,657 $ 7,671 Acquisitions, divestitures and other adjustments 4 361 365 Effect of foreign currency translation (229 ) (24 ) (253 ) Balance, December 31, 2015 $ 2,789 $ 4,994 $ 7,783 Acquisitions, divestitures and other adjustments (31 ) 170 139 Effect of foreign currency translation (62 ) (15 ) (77 ) Balance, December 31, 2016 $ 2,696 $ 5,149 $ 7,845 Cumulative impairments $ — $ 376 $ 376 At December 31, 2016, $50 million of goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets with finite lives are stated at historical cost, less accumulated amortization and impairment losses.
These intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives, which are reviewed annually.
74 Nielsen has purchased and internally developed software to facilitate its global information processing, financial reporting and client access needs.
Costs that are related to the conceptual formulation and design of software programs are expensed as incurred.
Costs that are incurred to produce the finished product after technological feasibility has been established are capitalized as an intangible asset and are amortized over the estimated useful life.
If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of software may not be recovered, a recoverability analysis is performed based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the software in the future.
If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from the future cash flows, the software cost is written down to estimate fair value and an impairment is recognized.
These estimates are subject to revision as market conditions and as our assessments change.
The impairment test for other indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount.
If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
The estimates of fair value of trade names and trademarks are determined using a “relief from royalty” discounted cash flow valuation methodology.
Significant assumptions inherent in this methodology include estimates of royalty rates and discount rates.
Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the respective intangible assets.
Assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which comparable trade names and trademarks are being licensed in the marketplace.
There was no impairment noted in any period presented with respect to the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets.
Nielsen is required to assess whether the value of the Company’s amortizable intangible assets have been impaired whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable.
Nielsen does not perform a periodic assessment of assets for impairment in the absence of such information or indicators.
Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable.
Recoverability of assets that are held and used is measured by comparing the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be derived from an asset (or a group of assets) to their carrying value.
If the carrying value of the asset (or the group of assets) exceeds the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows, impairment is considered to exist.
If impairment is considered to exist based on undiscounted cash flows, the impairment charge is measured using an estimation of the assets’ fair value, typically using a discounted cash flow method.
The identification of impairment indicators, the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of fair values for assets (or groups of assets) requires Nielsen to make significant judgments concerning the identification and validation of impairment indicators, expected cash flows and applicable discount rates.
These estimates are subject to revision as market conditions and our assessments change.
There was no impairment or indicators of impairment noted in any period presented with respect to the Company’s amortizable intangible assets.
The table below summarizes the carrying value of such intangible assets and their estimated useful lives: Gross Amounts Accumulated Amortization Estimated Weighted December 31, December 31, December 31, December 31, (IN MILLIONS) Useful Lives Average 2016 2015 2016 2015 Indefinite-lived intangibles: Trade names and trademarks $ 1,921 $ 1,921 $ — $ — Amortized intangibles: Trade names and trademarks 5-20 years 13 years 140 167 (88 ) (84 ) Customer-related intangibles 6-25 years 21 years 3,035 3,013 (1,312 ) (1,193 ) Covenants-not-to-compete 1-7 years 3 years 39 37 (36 ) (35 ) Computer software 3-10 years 5 years 2,223 1,919 (1,258 ) (1,055 ) Patents and other 3-10 years 6 years 173 168 (101 ) (86 ) Total $ 5,610 $ 5,304 $ (2,795 ) $ (2,453 ) The amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $425 million, $408 million and $404 million, respectively.
These amounts include amortization expense associated with computer software of $232 million, $219 million and $217 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Certain of the trade names associated with Nielsen are deemed indefinite-lived intangible assets, as their associated Nielsen brand awareness and recognition has existed for over 50 years and the Company intends to continue to utilize these trade names.
There are also no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that may limit their estimated useful lives.
Nielsen reconsiders the remaining estimated useful life of indefinite-lived intangible assets each reporting period.
The Company’s 2016, 2015 and 2014 annual assessments did not result in an impairment for any of its underlying reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets.
75 All other intangible assets are subject to amortization.
Future amortization expense is estimated to be as follows: (IN MILLIONS) For the year ending December 31: 2017 $ 399 2018 419 2019 353 2020 316 2021 296 Thereafter 1,032 Total $ 2,815 6.

Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives.
Nielsen is required to assess whether the value of our long-lived assets, including the Company’s buildings, improvements, technical and other equipment have been impaired whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable.
Nielsen does not perform a periodic assessment of assets for impairment in the absence of such information or indicators.
Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable.
Recoverability of assets that are held and used is measured by comparing the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be derived from an asset (or a group of assets) to their carrying value.
If the carrying value of the asset (or the group of assets) exceeds the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows, impairment is considered to exist.
If impairment is considered to exist based on undiscounted cash flows, the impairment charge is measured using an estimation of the assets’ fair value, typically using a discounted cash flow method.
The identification of impairment indicators, the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of fair values for assets (or groups of assets) requires Nielsen to make significant judgments concerning the identification and validation of impairment indicators, expected cash flows and applicable discount rates.
These estimates are subject to revision as market conditions and our assessments change.
There was no impairment or indicators of impairment noted in any period presented with respect to the Company’s finite long-lived assets.
The following tables summarizes the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment including the associated useful lives: Estimated December 31, December 31, (IN MILLIONS) Useful Life 2016 2015 Land and buildings 25-50 years $ 335 $ 337 Information and communication equipment 3-10 years 858 825 Furniture, equipment and other 3-10 years 103 108 1,296 1,270 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization (825 ) (780 ) $ 471 $ 490 77 Depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations related to property, plant and equipment was $165 million, $160 million and $162 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
The above amounts include amortization expense on assets under capital leases and other financing obligations of $37 million, $23 million and $10 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Capital leases and other financing obligations are comprised primarily of land and buildings and information and communication equipment.
Gross and net book value of assets under capital leases were as follows: (IN MILLIONS) December 31, 2016 Gross Book Value Accumulated Depreciation Net Book Value Land and buildings $ 174 $ (69 ) $ 105 Information and communication equipment 161 (72 ) 89 $ 335 $ (141 ) $ 194 December 31, 2015 Gross Book Value Accumulated Depreciation Net Book Value Land and buildings $ 170 $ (63 ) $ 107 Information and communication equipment 100 (41 ) 59 $ 270 $ (104 ) $ 166 8.
Fair Value Measurements Nielsen’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, investments, long-term debt and derivative financial instruments.
These financial instruments potentially subject Nielsen to concentrations of credit risk.
To minimize the risk of credit loss, these financial instruments are primarily held with acknowledged financial institutions.
The carrying value of Nielsen’s financial instruments approximate fair value, except for differences with respect to long-term, fixed and variable-rate debt and certain differences relating to investments accounted for at cost.
The fair value of financial instruments is generally determined by reference to market values resulting from trading on a national securities exchange or in an over-the-counter market.
In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques.
Cash equivalents have original maturities of three months or less.
In addition, the Company has accounts receivable that are not collateralized.
The Buy and Watch segments service high quality clients dispersed across many geographic areas.
The Company analyzes the aging of accounts receivable, historical bad debts, customer creditworthiness and current economic trends in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts.
Investments include available-for-sale securities carried at fair value, or at cost if not publicly traded, investments in affiliates, and a trading asset portfolio maintained to generate returns to offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements.
For the available-for-sale securities, any unrealized holding gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, are excluded from operating results and are recognized in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) net, until realized.
Nielsen assesses declines in the value of individual investments to determine whether such decline is other than temporary and thus the investment is impaired by considering available evidence.
No impairment charge was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
When determining fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact, and also considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of non-performance.
78 There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1: Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level 2: Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.
Level 3: Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable and may not be corroborated by market data.
Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Recurring Basis The Company’s financial assets and liabilities are measured and recorded at fair value, except for equity method investments, cost method investments, and long-term debt.
Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements.
The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their placement within the fair value hierarchy.
The following table summarizes the valuation of the Company’s material financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2016 and 2015: December 31, (IN MILLIONS) 2016 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets: Plan assets for deferred compensation (1) $ 32 32 — — Investment in mutual funds (2) 2 2 — — Interest rate swap arrangements (3) 3 — 3 — Total $ 37 $ 34 $ 3 — Liabilities: Interest rate swap arrangements (3) 5 — 5 — Deferred compensation liabilities (4) 32 32 — — Total 37 $ 32 5 — December 31, 2015 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets: Plan assets for deferred compensation (1) 30 30 — — Investment in mutual funds (2) 2 2 — — Total $ 32 $ 32 — — Liabilities: Interest rate swap arrangements (3) $ 6 — $ 6 — Deferred compensation liabilities (4) 30 30 — — Total $ 36 $ 30 $ 6 — (1) Plan assets are comprised of investments in mutual funds, which are intended to fund liabilities arising from deferred compensation plans.
These investments are carried at fair value, which is based on quoted market prices at period end in active markets.
These investments are classified as trading securities with any gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recorded in other income/(expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.
(2) Investments in mutual funds are money-market accounts held with the intention of funding certain specific retirement plans.
(3) Derivative financial instruments include interest rate swap arrangements recorded at fair value based on externally-developed valuation models that use readily observable market parameters and the consideration of counterparty risk.
(4) The Company offers certain employees the opportunity to participate in a deferred compensation plan.
A participant’s deferrals are invested in a variety of participant directed stock and bond mutual funds and are classified as trading securities.
Changes in the fair value of these securities are measured using quoted prices in active markets based on the market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held exclusive of any transaction costs.
A corresponding adjustment for changes in fair value of the trading securities is also reflected in the changes in fair value of the deferred compensation obligation.
79 Derivative Financial Instruments Nielsen uses interest rate swap derivative instruments principally to manage the risk that changes in interest rates will affect the cash flows of its underlying debt obligations.
To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship must meet several conditions with respect to documentation, probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement.
Nielsen documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions as well as the hedge effectiveness assessment, both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis.
Nielsen recognizes all derivatives at fair value either as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and changes in the fair values of such instruments are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
If specific cash flow hedge accounting criteria are met, Nielsen recognizes the changes in fair value of these instruments in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss).
Nielsen manages exposure to possible defaults on derivative financial instruments by monitoring the concentration of risk that Nielsen has with any individual bank and through the use of minimum credit quality standards for all counterparties.
Nielsen does not require collateral or other security in relation to derivative financial instruments.
A derivative contract entered into between Nielsen or certain of its subsidiaries and a counterparty that was also a lender under Nielsen’s senior secured credit facilities at the time the derivative contract was entered into is guaranteed under the senior secured credit facilities by Nielsen and certain of its subsidiaries (see Note 11 - Long-term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements for more information).
Since it is Nielsen’s policy to only enter into derivative contracts with banks of internationally acknowledged standing, Nielsen considers the counterparty risk to be remote.
It is Nielsen’s policy to have an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Master Agreement established with every bank with which it has entered into any derivative contract.
Under each of these ISDA Master Agreements, Nielsen agrees to settle only the net amount of the combined market values of all derivative contracts outstanding with any one counterparty should that counterparty default.
Certain of the ISDA Master Agreements contain cross-default provisions where if the Company either defaults in payment obligations under its credit facility or if such obligations are accelerated by the lenders, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations.
At December 31, 2016, Nielsen had no material exposure to potential economic losses due to counterparty credit default risk or cross-default risk on its derivative financial instruments.
Interest Rate Risk Nielsen is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on the floating-rate U.S. Dollar and Euro Term Loans, and uses floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps to hedge this exposure.
For these derivatives, Nielsen reports the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) and reclassifies it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and within the same income statement line item as the impact of the hedged transaction.
In June 2016, the company entered into $250 million in aggregate notional amount of a three-year forward interest rate swap agreement with a starting date of June 9, 2016.
This agreement fixes the LIBOR-related portion of interest rates of a corresponding amount of the Company’s variable-rate debt at an average rate of 0.86%.
This derivative has been designated as an interest rate cash flow hedge.
In July 2015, the Company entered into a $150 million in notional amount of three-year forward interest rate swap agreement with a starting date in July 2016.
This agreement fixes the LIBOR-related portion of the interest rates of a corresponding amount of the Company’s variable-rate debt at an average rate of 1.62%.
This derivative instrument has been designated as an interest rate cash flow hedge.
In April 2015, the Company entered into a $150 million in notional amount of three-year forward interest rate swap agreement with a starting date in April 2016.
This agreement fixes the LIBOR-related portion of the interest rates of a corresponding amount of the Company’s variable-rate debt at an average rate of 1.40%.
This derivative instrument has been designated as an interest rate cash flow hedge.
In November 2014, the Company entered into a $250 million in notional amount of two-year forward interest swap agreement with a starting date in May 2016.
This agreement fixes the LIBOR-related portion of the interest rate of a corresponding amount of the Company’s variable-rate debt at an average rate of 1.78%.
This derivative instrument has been designated as interest rate cash flow hedge.
80 In November 2014, the Company entered into a $250 million in notional amount of two-year forward interest swap agreement with a starting date in September 2015.
This agreement fixes the LIBOR-related portion of the interest rate of a corresponding amount of the Company’s variable-rate debt at an average rate of 1.26%.
This derivative instrument has been designated as interest rate cash flow hedge.
Nielsen expects to recognize approximately $4 million of net pre-tax losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense in the next 12 months associated with its interest-related derivative financial instruments.
As of December 31, 2016 the Company had the following outstanding interest rate swaps utilized in the management of its interest rate risk: Notional Amount Maturity Date Currency Interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments US Dollar term loan floating-to-fixed rate swaps $ 250,000,000 September 2017 US Dollar US Dollar term loan floating-to-fixed rate swaps $ 250,000,000 May 2018 US Dollar US Dollar term loan floating-to-fixed rate swaps $ 150,000,000 April 2019 US Dollar US Dollar term loan floating-to-fixed rate swaps $ 250,000,000 June 2019 US Dollar US Dollar term loan floating-to-fixed rate swaps $ 150,000,000 July 2019 US Dollar Foreign Currency Exchange Risk During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, Nielsen recorded a net gain of $1 million and $2 million respectively, associated with foreign currency derivative financial instruments within foreign currency exchange transactions losses, net in Nielsen’s consolidated statements of operations.
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the notional amounts of the outstanding foreign currency derivative financial instruments were $77 million and $37 million, respectively.

Fair Values of Derivative Instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets The fair values of the Company’s derivative instruments as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 Accounts Payable Accounts Payable Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments Other Non- Current and Other Current Other Non- Current and Other Current Other Non- Current (IN MILLIONS) Assets Liabilities Liabilities Liabilities Liabilities Interest rate swaps $ 3 $ 1 $ 4 $ 1 $ 5 Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships The pre-tax effect of derivative instruments in cash flow hedging relationships for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was as follows (amounts in millions): Amount of Loss Amount of Loss Recognized in OCI Location of Loss Reclassified from OCI on Derivatives Reclassified from OCI into Income Derivatives in Cash Flow (Effective Portion) into Income (Effective Portion) Hedging Relationships December 31, (Effective Portion) December 31, (IN MILLIONS) 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2014 Interest rate swaps $ 3 $ 14 $ 10 Interest expense $ 7 $ 12 $ 15 81 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis The Company is required, on a nonrecurring basis, to adjust the carrying value for certain assets using fair value measurements.
The Company’s equity method investments, cost method investments, and non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment, are measured at fair value when there is an indicator of impairment and recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized.
The Company did not measure any material non-financial assets or liabilities at fair value during the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015.

Restructuring Activities Restructuring charges primarily relate to employee separation packages.
The amounts are calculated based on salary levels and past service periods.
Severance costs are generally charged to earnings when planned employee terminations are approved.
A summary of the changes in the liabilities for restructuring activities is provided below: Total (IN MILLIONS) Initiatives Balance at December 31, 2013 $ 99 Charges 89 Non cash charges and other adjustments (3 ) Payments (113 ) Balance at December 31, 2014 72 Charges 51 Non cash charges and other adjustments (8 ) Payments (77 ) Balance at December 31, 2015 38 Charges 105 Non cash charges and other adjustments (1 ) Payments (69 ) Balance at December 31, 2016 $ 73 Of the $73 million in remaining liabilities for restructuring actions, $67 million is expected to be paid within one year and is classified as a current liability within the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2016.
Productivity Initiatives The Company recorded $105 million in restructuring charges primarily relating to employee severance associated with productivity initiatives and contract termination costs during the year ended December 31, 2016.
The Company recorded $51 million and $89 million in restructuring charges primarily relating to employee severance associated with productivity initiatives during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Pensions and Other Post-Retirement Benefits Nielsen sponsors both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans (the “Pension Plans”) and post-retirement medical plans for some if its employees in the Netherlands, the United States and other international locations.
Pension costs, in respect of defined benefit pension plans, primarily represent the increase in the actuarial present value of the obligation for pension benefits based on employee service during the year and the interest on this obligation in respect of employee service in previous years, net of the expected return on plan assets.
Differences between this expected return and the actual return on these plan assets and actuarial changes are not recognized in the statement of operations, unless the accumulated differences and changes exceed a certain threshold.
Nielsen recognizes obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans as expenses in the statement of operations as they are incurred.
82 The determination of benefit obligations and expenses is based on actuarial models.
In order to measure benefit costs and obligations using these models, critical assumptions are made with regard to the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets and the assumed rate of compensation increases.
Nielsen provides retiree medical benefits to a limited number of participants in the U.S.
Therefore, retiree medical care cost trend rates are not a significant driver of our post retirement costs.
Management reviews these critical assumptions at least annually.
Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as turnover, retirement and mortality rates.
Management reviews these assumptions periodically and updates them as necessary.
The discount rate is the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled.
For our U.S. plans, the discount rate is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency.
For the Dutch and other non-U.S. plans, the discount rate is set by reference to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds.
Nielsen believes the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds in these portfolios are expected to match the estimated payment benefit streams of our plans.
Effective January 1, 2016, the Company changed its approach to calculating the discount rate for its retirement benefit pension plans from a weighted-average yield curve approach to a spot-rate approach.
Under the spot-rate approach, the Company uses individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments in order to calculate interest cost and service cost within net periodic benefit costs.
The spot-rate approach represents a more precise measurement of interest and service cost.
The new approach represents a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle and accordingly is accounted for prospectively.
To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider, for each country, the structure of the asset portfolio and the expected rates of return for each of the components.
For Nielsen’s U.S. plans, a 50 basis point decrease in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense on our principal plans by approximately $1 million per year.
A similar 50 basis point decrease in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense on our principal Dutch plans by approximately $3 million per year.
The Company assumed that the weighted-averages of long-term returns on our pension plans were 5.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 6.0% for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
The expected long-term rate of return is applied to the fair value of pension plan assets.
The actual return on plan assets will vary year to year from this assumption.
Although the actual return on plan assets will vary from year to year, it is appropriate to use long-term expected forecasts in selecting our expected return on plan assets.
As such, there can be no assurance that the Company’s actual return on plan assets will approximate the long-term expected forecasts.

The settlement loss of $15 million in 2015 resulted primarily from lump- sum payments to deferred vested participants in the U.S. who elected to cash out their accrued benefit during a special offer.
The deferred loss included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) that is expected to be recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost during 2017 is as follows: The Netherlands United States Other Total Net actuarial loss $ (7 ) $ (6 ) $ (10 ) $ (23 ) Actuarial gains and losses are amortized over the average remaining service lives for plans with active participants, and over the average remaining lives for legacy plans with no active participants.
The weighted average assumptions underlying the pension computations were as follows: Year Ended December 31, (IN MILLIONS) 2016 2015 2014 Pension benefit obligation: —discount rate 2.5 % 3.2 % 2.8 % —rate of compensation increase 1.2 % 1.7 % 2.0 % Net periodic pension costs: —discount rate 3.2 % 2.8 % 4.1 % —rate of compensation increase 1.7 % 2.0 % 2.1 % —expected long-term return on plan assets 5.1 % 6.0 % 6.0 % 87 The assumptions for the expected return on plan assets for the Pension Plans were based on a review of the historical returns of the asset classes in which the assets of the Pension Plans are invested and long-term economic forecast for the type of investments held by the plans.
The historical returns on these asset classes were weighted based on the expected long-term allocation of the assets of the Pension Plans.
Nielsen’s pension plans’ weighted average asset allocations by asset category are as follows: The United Netherlands States Other Total At December 31, 2016 Equity securities 25 % 55 % 34 % 34 % Fixed income securities 57 44 37 47 Other 18 1 29 19 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % At December 31, 2015 Equity securities 25 % 54 % 42 % 36 % Fixed income securities 59 45 41 50 Other 16 1 17 14 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % No Nielsen shares are held by the Pension Plans.
Nielsen’s primary objective with regard to the investment of the Pension Plans’ assets is to ensure that in each individual plan, sufficient funds are available to satisfy future benefit obligations.
For this purpose, asset and liability management studies are made periodically at each pension fund.
For each of the Pension Plans, an appropriate mix is determined on the basis of the outcome of these studies, taking into account the national rules and regulations.
The overall target asset allocation among all plans for 2016 was 40% equity securities and 45% long-term interest-earning investments (debt or fixed income securities), and 15% other investments.
Equity securities primarily include investments in U.S. and non U.S. companies.
Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries and mortgage-backed securities.
Insurance contracts are categorized as level 3 and are valued based on contractual terms.
Assets at fair value (See Note 8 – “Fair Value Measurements” for additional information on fair value measurement and the underlying fair value hierarchy) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows: Our fair value hierarchy shown below excludes investments using the NAV per share practical expedient.
Application of the NAV per share practical expedient coincided with the change in investment management for one of the Company’s Pension Plans during 2016.

These assets are initially valued at cost and are reviewed periodically utilizing available and relevant market data to determine if the carrying value of these assets should be adjusted.
The valuation methodology is applied consistently from period to period.
Other types of investments categorized as Level 3 are primarily insurance contracts and are valued based on contractual terms.
In 2016, the Company adopted ASU No.
2015-07, Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent), which removed the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy, investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient.
The adoption of this ASU did not impact the 2015 presentation.
Contributions to the Pension Plans in 2017 are expected to be approximately $3 million for the Netherlands plan, $3 million for the U.S. plan and $15 million for other plans.

The Amended Credit Agreement provides for term loan facilities as shown in the table above.
In March 2016, Nielsen entered into an amendment to Nielsen’s Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, providing for additional Class A Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million, maturing in full in April 2019 (the “Additional Class A Term Loans”).
The Additional Class A Term Loans are required to be repaid in quarterly installments ranging from 1.369% to 4.11% of the original principal amount (as may be reduced as a result of voluntary prepayments), with the balance payable on the maturity date.
The Additional Class A Term Loans bear interest equal to, at Nielsen’s election, a base rate or eurocurrency rate, in each case plus an applicable margin which ranges from 0.50% to 1.25% (in the case of base rate loans) or 1.50% to 2.25% (in the case of eurocurrency rate loans).
The specific applicable margin is determined by Nielsen’s total leverage ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement).
This amendment was accounted for as a modification of the Amended Credit Agreement.
In October 2016, Nielsen entered into a second amendment to the Company’s Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, providing for (i) an incremental facility of Class B-2 Euro Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of €380 million, the proceeds of which were used to replace or refinance the existing Class B-2 Euro Term Loans and to repay certain other indebtedness, and (ii) a new class of term loans, Class B-3 Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of $1,900 million, the proceeds of which were used to replace or refinance in full a like amount of Nielsen’s applicable existing Class B-1 Term Loans that were maturing in May 2017 and Class B-2 Dollar Term Loans that were maturing in April 2021 and to repay certain other indebtedness.
The incremental Class B-2 Euro Term Loans will mature in full in April 2021 and are required to be repaid in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1.00% of the original principal amount of incremental Class B-2 Euro Term Loans, with the balance payable in April 2021.
The Class B-3 Term Loans will mature in full in October 2023 and are required to be repaid in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1.00% of the original principal amount of Class B-3 Term Loans, with the balance payable in October 2023.
Class B-2 Euro Term Loans will bear interest equal to the Eurocurrency rate plus an applicable margin, which is equal to 2.50%.
Class B-3 Term Loans bear interest equal to, at Nielsen’s election, a base rate or eurocurrency rate plus an applicable margin, which is equal to 2.50% (in the case of eurocurrency loans) or 1.50% (in the case of base rate loans).
This amendment was accounted for as a modification of the Amended Credit Agreement.
The Amended Credit Agreement contains the same affirmative and negative covenants as those of the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement prior to the 2016 amendments.
Obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are guaranteed by TNC B.V., substantially all of the wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries of TNC B.V. and certain of the non-U.S. wholly-owned subsidiaries of TNC B.V., and are secured by substantially all of the existing and future property and assets of the U.S. subsidiaries of TNC B.V. and by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of the guarantors, the capital stock of substantially all of the U.S. subsidiaries of TNC B.V., and up to 65% of the capital stock of certain of the non-U.S. subsidiaries of TNC B.V.
Under a separate security agreement, substantially all of the assets of TNC B.V. are pledged as collateral for amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement.
92 Covenants The Amended Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of Nielsen Holding and Finance B.V. and its restricted subsidiaries (which together constitute most of Nielsen’s subsidiaries) to incur additional indebtedness or guarantees, incur liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions, make certain loans and investments, declare dividends, make payments or redeem or repurchase capital stock, engage in certain mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations, prepay, redeem or purchase certain indebtedness, amend or otherwise alter terms of certain indebtedness, sell certain assets, transact with affiliates, enter into agreements limiting subsidiary distributions and alter the business they conduct.
These entities are restricted, subject to certain exceptions, in their ability to transfer their net assets to us.
Such restricted net assets amounted to approximately $4.2 billion at December 31, 2016.
In addition, these entities are subject to a total leverage covenant.
The leverage ratio requires that Nielsen not permit the ratio of total net debt (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) at the end of any calendar quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) for the four quarters then ended to exceed a specified threshold.
The maximum permitted ratio is 5.50 to 1.00.
Neither Nielsen nor TNC B.V. is currently bound by any financial or negative covenants contained in the Amended Credit Agreement.
The Amended Credit Agreement also contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default.
Certain significant financial covenants are described further below.
Failure to comply with this financial covenant would result in an event of default under Nielsen’s Amended Credit Agreement unless waived by certain of Nielsen’s term lenders and the Company’s revolving lenders.
An event of default under Nielsen’s Amended Credit Agreement can result in the acceleration of Nielsen’s indebtedness under the facilities, which in turn would result in an event of default and possible acceleration of indebtedness under the agreements governing Nielsen’sb debt securities as well.
As Nielsen’s failure to comply with the financial covenant described above can cause the Company to go into default under the agreements governing Nielsen’s indebtedness, management believes that Nielsen’s Amended Credit Agreement and this covenant are material to Nielsen.
As of December 31, 2016, Nielsen was in full compliance with the financial covenant described above.
Pursuant to Nielsen’s Amended Credit Agreement, the Company is subject to making mandatory prep ayments on the term loans within Nielsen’s Amended Credit Agreement to the extent in any full calendar year Nielsen generate Excess Cash Flow (“ECF”), as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement.
The percentage of ECF that must be applied as a repayment is a function of several factors, including Nielsen’s ratio of total net debt to Covenant EBITDA, as well other adjustments, including any voluntary term loan repayments made in the course of the calendar year.
To the extent any mandatory repayment is required pursuant to this ECF clause; such payment must generally occur on or around the time of the delivery of the annual consolidated financial statements to the lenders.
At December 31, 2016, Nielsen’s ratio of total net debt to Covenant EBITDA was less than 5.00 to 1.00 and therefore no mandatory repayment was required.
Nielsen’s next ECF measurement date will occur upon completion of the 2017 results, and although Nielsen do not expect to be required to issue any mandatory repayments in 2018 or beyond, it is uncertain at this time if any such payments will be required in future periods.
Revolving Credit Facility The Amended Credit Agreement also contains a senior secured revolving credit facility under which Nielsen Finance LLC, TNC (US) Holdings, Inc., and Nielsen Holding and Finance B.V. can borrow revolving loans.
The revolving credit facility can also be used for letters of credit, guarantees and swingline loans.
The existing revolving credit facility has commitments of $575 million with a final maturity of April 2019.
The senior secured revolving credit facility is provided under the Amended Credit Agreement and so contains covenants and restrictions as noted under the “Term loan facilities” section above.
Obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by the same entities that guarantee obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement and Senior Secured Loan Agreement.
As of December 31, 2016, Nielsen had zero borrowings outstanding and outstanding letters of credit of $6 million.
As of December 31, 2015, Nielsen had $164 million of borrowings outstanding and outstanding letters of credit of $7 million.
As of December 31, 2016, Nielsen had $569 million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility.
Debenture Loans The indentures governing the Senior Notes limit the majority of Nielsen’s subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase its capital stock, make certain investments, enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, use assets as security in other transactions and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies subject to certain exceptions.
Upon a change in control, Nielsen is required to make an offer to redeem all of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to the 101% of the aggregate accreted principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.
The Senior Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by Nielsen, substantially all of the wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries of Nielsen, and certain of the non-U.S. wholly-owned subsidiaries of Nielsen.
93 In February 2015, Nielsen completed the issuance of $750 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.0% Senior Notes due 2022.
The notes are traded interchangeably with the $750 million and the $800 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Senior Notes due 2022 issued in April 2014 and July 2014, respectively.
The proceeds from the issuances have been used to make repurchases of Nielsen’s outstanding common stock from time to time, in the open market or otherwise, pursuant to Nielsen’s existing share repurchase program, to reduce outstanding amounts under its revolving credit facility, to pay related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes.
In April 2014, Nielsen completed the issuance of $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.0% Senior Notes due 2022 at par.
In May 2014, the Company completed the redemption of $280 million in principal amount of its then currently outstanding $1,080 million aggregate principal amount of 7.75% Senior Notes due 2018 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof plus an applicable “make-whole” premium.
In July 2014, Nielsen completed the issuance of an additional $800 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% Senior Notes due 2022.
The notes are traded interchangeably with the $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Senior Notes due 2022 issued in April 2014.
In addition, in July 2014, the Company redeemed the remaining $800 million of outstanding 7.75% Senior Notes due 2018 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof plus an applicable “make-whole” premium.
As a result of these transactions, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $51 million during 2014 to other income/(expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations primarily related to the “make-whole” premium associated with the note redemption, as well as the write-off of certain previously capitalized debt financing fees associated with the 7.75% Senior Notes.
Subsequent Event In January 2017, Nielsen completed the issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% Senior Notes due 2025 at par, with cash proceeds of approximately $495 million, net of fees and expenses.
Other Transactions Effective July 1, 2010, the Company designated its Euro denominated variable rate senior secured term loans as non-derivative hedges of its net investment in a European subsidiary.
Gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in the Euro as compared to the U.S. Dollar associated with this debenture were recorded to the cumulative translation adjustment within stockholders’ equity, net of income tax.
Debt-Issuance Costs The costs related to the issuance of debt are presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability and amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the related debt.
Capital Lease and Other Obligations Nielsen finances certain computer equipment, software, buildings and automobiles under capital leases and related transactions.
These arrangements do not include terms of renewal, purchase options, or escalation clauses.
Assets under capital lease are recorded within property, plant and equipment.
See Note 7 – “Property, Plant and Equipment.” 94 Future minimum capital lease payments under non-cancelable capital leases at December 31, 2016 are as follows: (IN MILLIONS) 2017 $ 48 2018 48 2019 30 2020 21 2021 13 Thereafter 33 Total 193 Less: amount representing interest 35 Present value of minimum lease payments $ 158 Current portion $ 38 Total non-current portion 120 Present value of minimum lease payments $ 158 Capital leases and other financing transactions have effective interest rates primarily ranging from 4.5% to 10%.
Interest expense recorded related to capital leases and other financing transactions during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $11 million, $8 million and $8 million, respectively.
Nielsen recognizes rental income from non-cancelable subleases.
The total aggregate future rental income proceeds to be received under the non-cancelable subleases are $2 million.

Stock-Based Compensation Nielsen measures the cost of all stock-based payments, including stock options, at fair value on the grant date and recognizes such costs within the consolidated statements of operations; however, no expense is recognized for stock-based payments that do not ultimately vest.
Nielsen recognizes the expense of its options that cliff vest using the straight-line method.
For those that vest over time, an accelerated graded vesting is used.
The Company recorded $51 million, $48 million and $47 million of expense associated with stock-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
In connection with the Valcon Acquisition, Nielsen implemented an equity-based, management compensation plan (“Equity Participation Plan” or “EPP”) to align compensation for certain key executives with the performance of the Company.
Under this plan, certain of the Company’s executives may be granted stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and dividend equivalent rights in the shares of the Company or purchase its shares.
In connection with the completion of Nielsen’s initial public offering of common stock on January 31, 2011 (and further amended), the Company implemented the Nielsen 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Stock Incentive Plan”) and suspended further grants under the EPP.
The Stock Incentive Plan is the source of new equity-based awards permitting the Company to grant to its key employees, directors and other service providers the following types of awards: incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other awards valued in whole or in part by reference to shares of Nielsen’s common stock and performance-based awards denominated in shares or cash.
Under the Stock Incentive Plan, Nielsen granted 1,643,144 and 1,609,170 time-based stock options to purchase shares during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
As of December 31, 2016, the total number of shares authorized for award of options or other equity-based awards was 44,095,000 under the Stock Incentive Plan.
The 2016, 2015 and 2014 time-based awards become exercisable over a four-year vesting period at a rate of 25 % per year on the anniversary day of the award, and are tied to the executives’ continuing employment.
The fair values of the granted time-based awards granted during 2016, 2015 and 2014 were estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the expected volatility based on the Company’s historical volatility.
The following assumptions were used during 2016, 2015 and 2014: Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Expected life (years) 4.50-5.25 4.50-5.25 3.00-5.25 Risk-free interest rate 1.19-1.92 % 1.27-1.58 % 0.87-1.66 % Expected dividend yield 2.29- 2.90 % 2.18- 2.45 % 1.77- 2.39 % Expected volatility 20.02-23.44 % 23.44-23.70 % 23.50-25.32 % Weighted average volatility 20.89 % 23.56 % 23.99 % The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $51 million, $48 million and $47 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
The tax benefit related to the stock compensation expense was $13 million, $13 million and $15 million, for the respective periods.

At December 31, 2016, there is approximately $17 million of unearned stock-based compensation related to stock options which the Company expects to record as stock-based compensation expense over the next four years.
The compensation expense related to the time-based awards is amortized over the term of the award using the graded vesting method.
The intrinsic value of the options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $77 million, $94 million and $94 million, respectively.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, cash proceeds from the exercise of options was $103 million.

During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company granted 331,830, 381,576 and 333,700
performance restricted stock units, respectively, representing the target number of performance restricted stock subject to the award.
The weighted average grant date fair value of the awards in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $50.89, $45.37 and $50.50 per share.
For the performance restricted stock units granted in 2016, the total number of performance restricted stock units to be earned is subject to achievement of cumulative performance goals for the three year period ending December 31, 2018.
For the performance restricted stock units granted in 2015, the total number of performance restricted stock units to be earned is subject to achievement of cumulative performance goals for the three year period ending December 31, 2017.
For the performance restricted stock units granted in 2014, the total number of performance restricted stock units to be earned is subject to achievement of cumulative performance goals for the three year period ending December 31, 2016.
Forty percent of the target award will be determined based on the Company’s relative total shareholder return and sixty percent of the target award will be determined based on free cash flow achievements.
The maximum payout is 200% of target.
The fair value of the target award related to free cash flow was the fair value on the date of the grant, and the fair value of the target awards related to relative shareholder return was based on the Monte Carlo model.
As of December 31, 2015, there is approximately $16 million of unearned stock-based compensation related to unvested performance restricted stock (net of estimated forfeitures).
The compensation expense is amortized over the term of the award, which is 3 years after the grant date.

Income Taxes Nielsen provides for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
If it is determined that it is more likely than not that future tax benefits associated with a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is provided.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as an adjustment to income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Such tax positions are, based solely on their technical merits, more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities and reflect the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
The components of income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in net income of affiliates, were: Year Ended December 31, (IN MILLIONS) 2016 2015 2014 UK (2016-2015), Dutch (2014) $ (3 ) $ 16 $ 17 Non-UK (2016-2015), Non-Dutch (2014) 819 945 604 Income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in net income of affiliates $ 816 $ 961 $ 621 The above amounts for UK and non-UK or Dutch and non-Dutch activities were determined based on the location of the taxing authorities.
The provision for income taxes attributable to the income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in net income of affiliates consisted of: Year Ended December 31, (IN MILLIONS) 2016 2015 2014 Current: UK (2016-2015), Dutch (2014) $ — $ (6 ) $ 4 Non-UK (2016-2015), Non-Dutch (2014).

Valuation allowances are recorded in order to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized in the future.
101 At December 31, 2016 and 2015 the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $788 million and $807 million, respectively, which began to expire in 2017.
In addition, the Company had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $130 million and $157 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which began to expire in 2017.
In certain jurisdictions, the Company has operating losses and other tax attributes that, due to the uncertainty of achieving sufficient profits to utilize these operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards, the Company currently believes it is more likely than not that a portion of these losses will not be realized.
Therefore, the Company has a valuation allowance of approximately $99 million and $124 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to these net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards.
In addition, the Company has valuation allowances of $13 million and $20 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, on deferred tax assets related to other temporary differences, which the Company currently believes will not be realized.
As a consequence of the significant restructuring of the ownership of the Nielsen non-U.S. subsidiaries in 2007 and 2008 the Company has determined that as of December 31, 2016 no income taxes are required to be provided for on the approximately $3.0 billion, which is the excess of the book value of its investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries over the corresponding tax basis.
Certain of these differences can be eliminated in a tax neutral manner at a future date.
At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had gross uncertain tax positions of $432 million and $461 million, respectively.
The Company has also accrued interest and penalties associated with these unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 of $33 million and $34 million, respectively.
Estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes is classified as a component of benefit (provision) for income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
It is reasonably possible that a reduction in a range of $12 million to $20 million of uncertain tax positions may occur within the next twelve months as a result of projected resolutions of worldwide tax disputes and expirations of statute of limitations in various jurisdictions.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross uncertain tax positions is as follows: (IN MILLIONS) December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 Balance as of the beginning of period $ 461 $ 452 $ 475 Additions for current year tax positions 15 24 14 Additions for tax positions of prior years 7 14 12 Reductions for lapses of statute of limitations (6 ) (15 ) (12 ) Reductions for tax positions of prior years (45 ) (14 ) (37 ) Balance as of the end of the period $ 432 $ 461 $ 452 If the balance of the Company’s uncertain tax positions is sustained by the taxing authorities in the Company’s favor, the reversal of the entire balance would reduce the Company’s effective tax rate in future periods.
The Company files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions.
With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. Federal income tax examinations for 2006 and prior periods.
In addition, the Company has subsidiaries in various states, provinces and countries that are currently under audit for years ranging from 1998 through 2015.

Investments in Affiliates and Related Party Transactions Related Party Transactions with Affiliates As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, Nielsen had investments in affiliates of $16 million and $13 million, respectively.
Obligations between Nielsen and its affiliates are regularly settled in cash in the ordinary course of business.
Nielsen had net receivables from its affiliates of approximately $2 million and $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
On October 1, 2015, Nielsen acquired an additional 13.5% of NCS, a joint venture between Nielsen and Catalina for $40 million, net of cash acquired.
The joint venture was historically accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
As part of this transaction we gained control of NCS, as such accounted for it as a step-acquisition and calculated the fair value of the investment immediately before the acquisition to be $161 million.
As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a $158 million gain on the investment in NCS to other income/(expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations.
Commencing October 1, 2015, NCS was included as a consolidated subsidiary within Nielsen’s consolidated financial statements.
102 16.
Commitments and Contingencies Leases and Other Contractual Arrangements In February 2013, the Company amended its Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement (the “MSA”), dated as of October 1, 2007 with Tata America International Corporation and Tata Consultancy Services Limited (jointly, “TCS”).
The term of the MSA has been extended for an additional three years, so as to expire on December 31, 2020, with a one-year renewal option granted to Nielsen.
In addition, the Company has increased its commitment to purchase services from TCS (the “Minimum Commitment”) from $1.0 billion to $2.5 billion over the life of the contract (from October 1, 2007), including a commitment to purchase at least $100 million in services per year until calendar year 2020 when the per year commitment is reduced to $75 million, (the “Annual Commitment”).
Nielsen met the Minimum Commitment in 2016.
TCS’s charges under the separate Global Infrastructure Services Agreement between the parties will be credited against the Minimum Commitment and the Annual Commitment.
TCS will continue to globally provide the Company with professional services relating to information technology (including application development and maintenance), business process outsourcing, client service knowledge process outsourcing, measurement sciences, analytics, and financial planning and analytics.
As Nielsen orders specific services under the Agreement, the parties will execute Statements of Work (“SOWs”) describing the specific scope of the services to be performed by TCS.
The amount of the Minimum Commitment and the Annual Commitment may be reduced on the occurrence of certain events, some of which also provide the Company with the right to terminate the Agreement or SOWs, as applicable.
Nielsen has also entered into operating leases and other contractual obligations to secure real estate facilities, agreements to purchase data processing services and leases of computers and other equipment used in the ordinary course of business and various outsourcing contracts.
These agreements are not unilaterally cancelable by Nielsen, are legally enforceable and specify fixed or minimum amounts or quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices.
The amounts presented below represent the minimum annual payments under Nielsen’s purchase obligations that have initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year.
These purchase obligations include data processing, building maintenance, equipment purchasing, photocopiers, land and mobile telephone service, computer software and hardware maintenance, and outsourcing.
For the Years Ending December 31, (IN MILLIONS) 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Thereafter Total Operating leases $ 85 $ 69 $ 53 $ 35 $ 26 $ 73 $ 341 Other contractual obligations(a) 289 212 153 106 9 6 775 Total $ 374 $ 281 $ 206 $ 141 $ 35 $ 79 $ 1,116 (a) Other contractual obligations represent obligations under agreement, which are not unilaterally cancelable by Nielsen, are legally enforceable and specify fixed or minimum amounts or quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices.
Nielsen generally requires purchase orders for vendor and third party spending.
The amounts presented above represent the minimum future annual services covered by purchase obligations including data processing, building maintenance, equipment purchasing, photocopiers, land and mobile telephone service, computer software and hardware maintenance, and outsourcing.
Nielsen’s remaining commitments as of December 31, 2016, under the outsourced services agreement with TCS have been included above based on the Annual Commitment minimum required payments.
Total expenses incurred under operating leases were $79 million, $76 million and $81 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Nielsen recognized rental income received under subleases of $8 million, $9 million and $11 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
At December 31, 2016, Nielsen had aggregate future proceeds to be received under non-cancelable subleases of $15 million.
Nielsen also has minimum commitments under non-cancelable capital leases.
See Note 11 “Long-term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements” for further discussion.
103 Guarantees and Other Contingent Commitments At December 31, 2016, Nielsen was committed under the following significant guarantee arrangements: Sub-lease guarantees Nielsen provides sub-lease guarantees in accordance with certain agreements pursuant to which Nielsen guarantees all rental payments upon default of rental payment by the sub-lessee.
To date, the Company has not been required to perform under such arrangements, does not anticipate making any significant payments related to such guarantees and, accordingly, no amounts have been recorded.
Letters of credit Letters of credit issued and outstanding amount to $6 million and $7 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Legal Proceedings and Contingencies Nielsen is subject to litigation and other claims in the ordinary course of business, some of which include claims for substantial sums.
Accruals have been recorded when the outcome is probable and can be reasonably estimated.
While the ultimate results of claims and litigation cannot be determined, the Company does expect that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its operations or financial condition.
However, depending on the amount and the timing, an unfavorable resolution of some or all of these matters could materially affect the Company’s future results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.

Segments The Company aligns its operating segments in order to conform to management’s internal reporting structure, which is reflective of service offerings by industry.
Management aggregates such operating segments into two reporting segments: what consumers buy, consisting principally of market research information and analytical services, and what consumers watch and listen to, consisting principally of television, radio, online and mobile audience and advertising measurement services and corresponding analytics.
Corporate consists principally of unallocated items such as certain facilities and infrastructure costs as well as intersegment eliminations.
Certain corporate costs, other than those described in Item 7 “Management Discussion and Analysis”, including those related to selling, finance, legal, human resources, and information technology systems, are considered operating costs and are allocated to the Company’s segments based on either the actual amount of costs incurred or on a basis consistent with the operations of the underlying segment.
Information with respect to the operations of each of Nielsen’s business segments is set forth below based on the nature of the services offered and geographic areas of operations.

Guarantor Financial Information The following supplemental financial information is being provided for purposes of compliance with reporting covenants contained in certain debt obligations of Nielsen and its subsidiaries.
The financial information sets forth for Nielsen, its subsidiaries that have issued certain debt securities (the “Issuers”) and its guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries, the consolidating balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and consolidating statements of operations and cash flows for the periods ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company re-designated certain subsidiaries between guarantor and non-guarantor.
As a result, the Company adjusted prior periods to reflect the current year structure.
The issued debt securities are jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by Nielsen and subject to certain exceptions, each of the direct and indirect 100% owned subsidiaries of Nielsen, in each case to the extent that such entities provide a guarantee under the senior secured credit facilities.
The issuers are also 100% owned indirect subsidiaries of Nielsen: Nielsen Finance LLC and Nielsen Finance Co. for certain series of debt obligations, and The Nielsen Company (Luxembourg) S.ar.l., for the other series of debt obligations.
Each issuer is a guarantor of the debt obligations not issued by it.
Nielsen is a holding company and does not have any material assets or operations other than ownership of the capital stock of its direct and indirect subsidiaries.
All of Nielsen’s operations are conducted through its subsidiaries, and, therefore, Nielsen is expected to continue to be dependent upon the cash flows of its subsidiaries to meet its obligations.
The senior secured credit facilities contain certain limitations on the ability of Nielsen to receive the cash flows of its subsidiaries.
While all subsidiary guarantees of the issued debt securities are full and unconditional, these guarantees contain customary release provisions including when (i) the subsidiary is sold or sells all of its assets, (ii) the subsidiary is declared “unrestricted” for covenant purposes, (iii) the subsidiary’s guarantee under the senior secured credit facilities is released and (iv) the requirements for discharge of the indenture have been satisfied.

In February 2017, Nielsen completed the acquisition of Gracenote, through the purchase of 100% of Gracenote’s outstanding common stock for a total cash purchase price of $560 million (the “Acquisition”).
Nielsen acquired the data and technology that underpins the programming guides and personalized user experience for major video, music, audio and sports content.
The acquisition extends Nielsen’s footprint with major clients by including Gracenote’s global content database which spans across platforms including multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs), smart televisions, streaming music services, connected devices, media players and in-car infotainment systems.
Gracenote will consolidate into Nielsen’s Watch segment.
The Acquisition will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires, among other things, the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date.
The Company is in the process of preparing the initial accounting of the transaction and expects to establish a preliminary purchase price allocation by the end of the first quarter of 2017.
