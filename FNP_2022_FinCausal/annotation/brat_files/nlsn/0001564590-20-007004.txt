Background and Executive Summary We are a leading global measurement and data analytics company that provides clients with a comprehensive understanding of consumers and consumer behavior.
Our approach marries our proprietary data with other data sources to help clients around the world understand what's happening now, what's happening next, and how to best act on this knowledge.
For more than 90 years we have provided data and analytics based on scientific rigor and innovation, continually developing new ways to answer the most important questions facing the media, advertising, retail and fast-moving consumer goods industries.
We have a presence in more than 100 countries, including many emerging markets, and hold leading market positions in many of our services and geographies.
We believe that important measures of our results of operations include revenue, operating income/(loss) and Adjusted EBITDA (defined below).
Our long-term financial objectives include consistent revenue growth and expanding operating margins.
Accordingly, we are focused on geographic market and service offering expansion to drive revenue growth and improve operating efficiencies, including effective resource utilization, information technology leverage and overhead cost management.
Our business strategy is built upon a model that has traditionally yielded consistent revenue performance.
Typically, before the start of each year, more than 70% of our annual revenue has been committed under contracts in our combined Nielsen Global Connect (“Connect”) and Nielsen Global Media (“Media”) segments, which provides us with a greater degree of stability for our revenue and allows us to more effectively manage our profitability and cash flows.
See “Business Segment Overview” below for further discussion.
We continue to look for growth opportunities through global expansion, specifically within emerging markets, as well as through the cross-platform expansion of our analytical services and measurement services.
On November 3, 2019, our Board of Directors completed its strategic review and approved a plan to spin-off our Global Connect business, creating two independent, publicly traded companies - the Global Media business and the Global Connect business - each of which will have sharper strategic focus and greater opportunity to leverage its unique competitive advantages.
Our restructuring and other productivity initiatives have been focused on a combination of improving operating leverage through targeted cost-reduction programs, business process improvements and portfolio restructuring actions, while at the same time investing in key programs to enhance future growth opportunities.
Achieving our business objectives requires us to manage a number of key risk areas.
Our growth objective of geographic market and service expansion requires us to maintain the consistency and integrity of our information and underlying processes on a global scale, and to invest effectively our capital in technology and infrastructure to keep pace with our clients’ demands and our competitors.
Core to managing these key risk areas is our commitment to data privacy and security as it drives our ability to deliver quality insights for our clients in line with evolving regulatory requirements and governing standards across all the geographies and industries in which we operate.
Our operating footprint across more than 100 countries requires disciplined global and local resource management of internal and third party providers to ensure success.
In addition, our high level of indebtedness requires active management of our debt profile, with a focus on underlying maturities, interest rate risk, liquidity and operating cash flows.
34 Business Segment Overview Prior to February 2019, we were aligned into two reporting segments: what consumers buy (“Buy”) and what consumers read, watch and listen to (“Watch”).
In February 2019, we realigned our business segments from Buy and Watch to Connect and Media.
Each segment operates as a complete unit—from the conception of a product, through the collection of the data, into the technology and operations, all the way to the data being sold and delivered to the client.
Our Connect and Media segments are built on a foundation of proprietary data assets that are designed to yield essential insights for our clients to successfully measure, analyze and grow their businesses.
Our segments each consist of two categories: Measure and Predict / Activate in Connect and Audience Measurement and Plan / Optimize in Media.
These categories are based on our core measurement platforms in both Connect and Media, while Predict / Activate and Plan / Optimize are designed to build on our measurement capabilities to enhance client decision-making.
These changes better align our external view to our go-forward internal view.
Our reportable segments are stated on the new basis and such changes were retrospectively applied.
The impact of these changes did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements or segment results.
Our Connect segment provides measurement services, which include our core tracking and scan data (primarily transactional measurement data and consumer behavior information), and analytical services to businesses in the consumer packaged goods industry.
Our services also enable our clients to better manage their brands, uncover new sources of demand, launch and grow new products, analyze their sales and establish more effective consumer relationships.
Our data is used by our clients to measure their market share, tracking billions of sales transactions per month in retail outlets around the world.
Our extensive database of retail and consumer information, combined with our advanced analytical capabilities, helps generate strategic insights that influence our clients’ key business decisions.
Our Media segment provides viewership and listening data and analytics primarily to the media and advertising industries for television, radio, digital and mobile viewing and listening platforms.
Our Media data is used by our media clients to understand their audiences, establish the value of their advertising inventory and maximize the value of their content, and by our advertising clients to plan and optimize their spending.
Certain corporate costs, including those related to selling, finance, legal, human resources, and information technology systems, are considered operating costs and are allocated to our segments based on either the actual amount of costs incurred or on a basis consistent with the operations of the underlying segment.
Critical Accounting Policies The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
The most significant of these policies relate to: revenue recognition; business combinations including purchase price allocations; accruals for pension costs and other post-retirement benefits; accounting for income taxes; and valuation of long-lived assets including goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, computer software and share-based compensation.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the valuation of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis.
Actual results could vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
For a summary of the significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies discussed below, see Note 1 – “Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” – to our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the modified retrospective method.
The ASC has been applied to all contracts as of the date of adoption.
There was no impact on our financial statements as a result of this adoption.
Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer.
We recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a product or service to a customer, which generally occurs over time.
Substantially all of our customer contracts are non-cancelable and non-refundable.
35 The following is a description of principal activities, by reportable segment, from which we generate its revenues.
Revenue from the Connect segment consists primarily of measurement services, which include our core tracking and scan data (primarily transactional measurement data and consumer behavior information) to businesses in the consumer packaged goods industry.
Our data is used by its clients to measure their market share, tracking billions of sales transactions per month in retail outlets around the world.
Revenues for these services are recognized over the period during which the performance obligations are satisfied as the customer receives and consumes the benefits provided us and control of the services are transferred to the customer.
We also provide consumer intelligence and analytical services that help clients make smarter business decisions throughout their product development and marketing cycles.
Our performance under these arrangements do not create an asset with an alternative use to us and generally include an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, as such, revenue for these services is typically recognized over time.
Revenue for contracts that do not include an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date is recognized at a point in time when the performance obligation is satisfied, generally upon delivery of the services, and when control of the service is transferred to the customer.
Revenue from our Media segment is primarily generated from television, radio, digital and mobile audience measurement services and analytics which are used by our media clients to establish the value of airtime and more effectively schedule and promote their programming and our advertising clients to plan and optimize their spending.
As the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by our performance, revenues for these services are recognized over the period during which the performance obligations are satisfied and control of the service is transferred to the customer.
We enter into cooperation arrangements with certain customers, under which the customer provides us with its data in exchange for our services.
We record these transactions at fair value, which is determined based on the fair value of goods or services received, if reasonably estimable.
If not reasonably estimable, we consider the fair value of the goods or services surrendered.
Share-based Compensation Expense Recognition Our share-based compensation programs are comprised of stock options, performance-based stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance restricted stock units.
We measure the cost of all share-based payments, including stock options, at fair value on the grant date and recognize such costs within the consolidated statements of operations; however, no expense is recognized for share-based payments that do not ultimately vest.
We recognize expense associated with share-based payments that vest upon a single date using the straight-line method.
For those that vest over time, an accelerated graded vesting is used.
We recorded $50 million, $35 million and $45 million of expense associated with share-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate grant date fair value of all outstanding vested and unvested options was $20 million and $3 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate grant date fair value of all outstanding vested and unvested performance stock options was $2 million and $2 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2019, the following amounts of unearned share-based compensation (net of estimated forfeitures) are expected to be recognized: approximately $1 million related to stock options over the next two years, approximately $1 million related to performance stock options over the next two years, approximately $51 million related to unvested RSUs over a weighted average period of 2.8 years and approximately $6 million related to performance restricted stock units over the next two years.
Fair Value Measurement Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment.
Share-based compensation expense for time-based stock options is primarily based on the estimated grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which considers factors such as estimating the expected term of stock options, expected volatility of our stock, and the number of share-based awards expected to be forfeited due to future terminations.
Some of the critical assumptions used in estimating the grant date fair value are presented in the table below: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Expected life (years) — 6.00 4.50 Risk-free interest rate — 2.87 % 2.02 % Expected dividend yield — 4.97 % 3.76 % Expected volatility — 25.96 % 22.01 % Weighted-average volatility — 25.96 % 22.01 % 36 Under the Nielsen 2010 Stock Incentive Plan, we granted time and performance based stock options to purchase shares during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Share-based compensation expense for the time and performance based stock options is based on the Monte Carlo simulation model which considers factors such as estimating the expected term of stock options, expected volatility of our stock, and the number of share-based awards expected to be forfeited due to future terminations.
Some of the critical assumptions used in estimating the grant date fair value are presented in the table below: Year Ended December 31, 2018 Expected life (years) 5.00 Risk-free interest rate 2.83-2.92 % Expected dividend yield 4.85-5.54 % Expected volatility 27.11-27.27 % Weighted-average volatility 27.13 % We consider the historical option exercise behavior of our employees in estimating the expected life of our options granted, which we believe are representative of future behavior.
For 2018, expected volatility was based on our historical volatility.
For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2017, there were no time and performance based stock options issued.
In addition, for share-based awards where vesting is dependent upon achieving certain operating performance goals, we estimate the likelihood of achieving the performance goals.
The total number of performance restricted share units to be earned is subject to achievement of cumulative performance goals for the three year period.
For the 2019 award, fifty percent of the target award will be determined based on the Company’s revenue compounded annual growth rate achievements and fifty percent of the award will be determined based on adjusted earnings per share achievements.
There is a relative total shareholder return modifier that can increase or decrease the payout.
For the 2018 award, twenty five percent of the target award will be determined based on the Company’s revenue compounded annual growth rate achievements, twenty five percent of the target award will be based on the Company’s relative total shareholder return and fifty percent of the award will be determined based on free cash flow achievements.
For the 2017 awards, forty percent of the target award will be determined based on the Company’s relative total shareholder return and sixty percent of the target award will be determined based on free cash flow achievements.
The maximum payout is 200% of target.
Differences between actual results and these estimates could have a material effect on our financial results.
The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent our best estimates and, although we believe them to be reasonable, these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment.
If factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of our option-pricing model in future periods or if we experience different forfeiture rates, the compensation expense that is derived may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current year.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity date of three months or less.
Cash and cash equivalents are carried at fair value.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting of certain trade names and trademarks, are each tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable.
We review the recoverability of our goodwill by comparing the estimated fair values of reporting units with their respective carrying amounts.
We have designated October 1st as the date in which the annual assessment is performed as this timing corresponds with the development of the Company’s formal budget and business plan review.
We established, and continue to evaluate, our reporting units based on our internal reporting structure and define such reporting units at our operating segment level or one level below.
The estimates of fair value of a reporting unit are determined using a combination of valuation techniques, primarily by an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis and supplemented by a market-based approach.
37 A discounted cash flow analysis requires the use of various assumptions, including expectations of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and tax rates in developing the present value of future cash flow projections.
Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside of the control of management, and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods.
Changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit, and therefore could affect the amount of potential impairment.
The following assumptions are significant to our discounted cash flow analysis: • Business projections – expected future cash flows and growth rates are based on assumptions about the level of business activity in the marketplace as well as applicable cost levels that drive our budget and business plans.
The budget and business plans are updated at least annually and are frequently reviewed by management and our Board of Directors.
Actual results of operations, cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation, and it is possible that differences and changes could be material.
A deterioration in profitability, adverse market conditions and a slower or weaker economic recovery than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future.
Should such events or circumstances arise, management would evaluate other options available at that time that, if executed, could result in future profitability.
• Long-term growth rates – the assumed long-term growth rate representing the expected rate at which a reporting unit’s earnings stream, beyond that of the budget and business plan period, is projected to grow.
These rates are used to calculate the terminal value, or value at the end of the future earnings stream, of our reporting units, and are added to the cash flows projected for the budget and business plan period.
The long-term growth rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit such as the maturity of the underlying services.
The long-term growth rates we used for each of our reporting units in our 2019 evaluation were between 1.5% and 2.5%.
• Discount rates – the reporting unit’s combined future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted-average cost of capital that is likely to be used by market participants.
The weighted-average cost of capital is our estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise.
The discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit.
The discount rates we used in our 2019 evaluation of our reporting units were between 10.25% and 11.25%.
These estimates and assumptions vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit.
We believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable, but they are susceptible to change from period to period.
We also use a market-based approach in estimating the fair value of our reporting units.
The market-based approach utilizes available market comparisons such as indicative industry multiples that are applied to current year revenue and earnings, next year’s revenue and earnings as well as recent comparable transactions.
To validate the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values, we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units to our enterprise market capitalization.
Enterprise market capitalization includes, among other factors, the market value of our common stock and the appropriate redemption values of our debt.
During the first quarter of 2019, we updated our reporting structure in a manner that changed the composition of our reporting units.
The result of this change was combining two of our reporting units into one.
Both of these reporting units were in the former Watch reportable segment.
The current reporting units are Media and Connect (formerly Watch and Buy), which is the same as our reportable segments.
As a result of this change in reporting units, we performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis during the first quarter immediately prior to the change and after the change, and determined that the estimated fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values (including goodwill).
As such, there was no impairment as a result of this change.
In connection with our strategic review, we considered various alternatives for us including the potential sale of the Connect business.
During this process, there were indications that the fair value of the Connect reporting unit was lower than the carrying value.
We considered this as well as other factors to be interim indicators of impairment and determined that it was more likely than not that the Connect reporting unit was impaired.
Management performed an updated impairment analysis of Connect as of September 30, 2019.
As a result of this analysis, we concluded that the fair value was less than the carrying value and recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $1,004 million for the Connect reporting unit.
The primary inputs for determining the estimated fair value were inputs from the strategic review process, market values for comparable entities and updated intrinsic values.
38 The following table summarizes the results of the two reporting units that were subject to the October 1, 2019 annual impairment testing and the related goodwill value associated with the reporting units for (a) fair values exceeding carrying values by less than 10%, (b) fair values exceeding carrying values between 10% and 20%, and (c) fair values exceeding carrying values by more than 20%.
There was no impairment or indicators of impairment noted in the October 1, 2019 assessment.
The table below represents the reporting units goodwill balances as of December 31, 2019.
Fair value exceeds carrying value by: Number of reporting units Reporting units goodwill (in millions) Less than 10% — $ — 10% to 20% 1 331 Greater than 20% 1 5,662 Total 2 $ 5,993 We perform sensitivity analyses on our assumptions, primarily around both long-term growth rate and discount rate assumptions.
Our sensitivity analyses include several combinations of reasonably possible scenarios with regard to these assumptions, including a one percent movement in both our long-term growth rate and discount rate assumptions.
When applying these sensitivity analyses, we noted that the fair value was greater than the carrying value for both of our reporting units.
While management believes that these sensitivity analyses provide a reasonable basis on which to evaluate the recovery of our goodwill, other facts or circumstances may arise that could impact the impairment assessment and therefore these analyses should not be used as a sole predictor of impairment.
The impairment test for other indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount.
If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
The estimates of fair value of trade names and trademarks are determined using a “relief from royalty” discounted cash flow valuation methodology.
Significant assumptions inherent in this methodology include estimates of royalty rates and discount rates.
Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the respective intangible assets.
Assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which comparable trade names and trademarks are being licensed in the marketplace.
There was no impairment noted in any period presented with respect to the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets.
As of the October 1, 2019 assessment, one of our indefinite-lived intangible assets had a fair value that exceeded its carrying value by less than 10%.
Pension Costs We provide a number of retirement benefits to our employees, including defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical plans.
Pension costs, in respect of defined benefit pension plans, primarily represent the increase in the actuarial present value of the obligation for pension benefits based on employee service during the year and the interest on this obligation in respect of employee service in previous years, net of the expected return on plan assets.
Differences between this expected return and the actual return on these plan assets and actuarial changes are not recognized in the statement of operations, unless the accumulated differences and changes exceed a certain threshold.
The excess is amortized and charged to the statement of operations over, at the maximum, the average remaining term of employee service.
We recognize obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans as expenses in the statement of operations as they are incurred.
The determination of benefit obligations and expenses is based on actuarial models.
In order to measure benefit costs and obligations using these models, critical assumptions are made with regard to the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets and the assumed rate of compensation increases.
We provide retiree medical benefits to a limited number of participants in the U.S.
Therefore, retiree medical care cost trend rates are not a significant driver of our post retirement costs.
Management reviews these critical assumptions at least annually.
Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as turnover, retirement and mortality rates.
Management reviews these assumptions periodically and updates them as necessary.
The discount rate is the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled.
For our U.S. plans, the discount rate is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency.
For the Dutch and other non-U.S. plans, the discount rate is set by reference to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds.
We believe the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds in these portfolios are expected to match the estimated payment benefit streams of our plans.
39 To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider, for each country, the structure of the asset portfolio and the expected rates of return for each of the components.
For our U.S. plans, a 50 basis point decrease in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense on our principal plans by approximately $1 million per year.
A similar 50 basis point decrease in the expected return on assets for the Company’s Dutch plan would also increase pension expense by approximately $1 million per year.
We assumed that the weighted-averages of long-term returns on our pension plans were 4.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019, 4.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The expected long-term rate of return is applied to the fair value of pension plan assets.
The actual return on plan assets will vary year to year from this assumption.
Although the actual return on plan assets will vary from year to year, it is appropriate to use long-term expected forecasts in selecting our expected return on plan assets.
As such, there can be no assurance that our actual return on plan assets will approximate the long-term expected forecasts.
During 2019, certain of our pension plans contracted with insurance companies and transferred $632 million of outstanding defined benefit pension obligations and related pension assets for approximately 6,000 retirees and beneficiaries in the Netherlands and UK to these insurance companies.
These insurance companies are now required to pay and administer the retirement benefits owed to these retirees and beneficiaries.
These transactions have no impact on the amount, timing, or form of the monthly retirement benefit payments to the covered retirees and beneficiaries.
These transactions resulted in a non-cash charge to other income/expense of $170 million in our consolidated statements of operations and did not impact cash flows in 2019.
Income Taxes We have a presence in more than 100 countries, and our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income or loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in where or how we do business, acquisitions or dispositions, audit-related developments, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions.
Additionally, our effective tax rate can fluctuate based on the level of pre-tax income or loss.
For example, the impact of non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower.
We have completed a number of material acquisitions and divestitures which have generated complex tax issues requiring management to use its judgment to make various tax determinations.
We have sought to organize the affairs of our subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner, taking into consideration the jurisdictions in which we operate.
Although we are confident that tax returns have been appropriately prepared and filed, there is risk that additional tax may be assessed on certain transactions or that the deductibility of certain expenditures may be disallowed for tax purposes.
Our policy is to estimate tax risk to the best of our ability and provide accordingly for those risks and take positions in which a high degree of confidence exists that the tax treatment will be accepted by the tax authorities.
The policy with respect to deferred taxation is to provide in full for temporary differences using the liability method.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are computed by assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
The carrying value of deferred tax assets is adjusted by a valuation allowance to the extent that these deferred tax assets are not considered to be realized on a more likely than not basis.
Realization of deferred tax assets is based, in part, on our judgment and various factors including reversal of deferred tax liabilities, our ability to generate future taxable income in jurisdictions where such assets have arisen and potential tax planning strategies.
Valuation allowances are recorded in order to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized in the future.
We record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Such tax positions are, based solely on their technical merits, more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities and reflect the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis, which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information.
We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
40 Long-Lived Assets We are required to assess whether the value of our long-lived assets, including our buildings, improvements, technical and other equipment, and amortizable intangible assets have been impaired whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable.
We do not perform a periodic assessment of assets for impairment in the absence of such information or indicators.
Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable.
Recoverability of assets that are held and used is measured by comparing the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be derived from an asset (or a group of assets) to their carrying value.
If the carrying value of the asset (or the group of assets) exceeds the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows, impairment is considered to exist.
If impairment is considered to exist based on undiscounted cash flows, the impairment charge is measured using an estimation of the assets’ fair value, typically using a discounted cash flow method.
The identification of impairment indicators, the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of fair values for assets (or groups of assets) requires us to make significant judgments concerning the identification and validation of impairment indicators, expected cash flows and applicable discount rates.
These estimates are subject to revision as market conditions and our assessments change.
We capitalize software development costs with respect to major internal use software initiatives or enhancements.
The costs are capitalized from the time that the preliminary project stage is completed, and we consider it probable that the software will be used to perform the function intended until the time the software is placed in service for its intended use.
Once the software is placed in service, the capitalized costs are generally amortized over periods of three to seven years.
If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of software may not be recovered, a recoverability analysis is performed based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the software in the future.
If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, the software cost is written down to estimated fair value and an impairment is recognized.
These estimates are subject to revision as market conditions and as our assessments change.
No impairment indicators were noted for other long-lived assets for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
The Company’s impairment assessments resulted in the recognition of a non-cash self-developed software asset impairment charge of $2 million during the fourth quarter of 2018.
Factors Affecting Nielsen’s Financial Results Acquisitions, Dispositions and Investments in Affiliates Acquisitions For the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid cash consideration of $61 million associated with current period acquisitions, net of cash acquired.
Had these 2019 acquisitions occurred as of January 1, 2019, the impact on our consolidated results of operations would not have been material.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, we paid cash consideration of $43 million associated with both current period and previously executed acquisitions, net of cash acquired.
Had these 2018 acquisitions occurred as of January 1, 2018, the impact on our consolidated results of operations would not have been material.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, including Gracenote, we paid cash consideration of $778 million associated with both current period and previously executed acquisitions, net of cash acquired.
Had these 2017 acquisitions occurred as of January 1, 2017, the impact on our consolidated results of operations would not have been material.
Foreign Currency Our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars and are therefore subject to the impact of movements in exchange rates on the translation of the financial information of individual businesses whose functional currencies are other than U.S. dollars.
Our principal foreign exchange revenue exposure is spread across several currencies, primarily the Euro.
The table below sets forth the profile of our revenue by principal currency.
Year endedDecember 31,2019 Year endedDecember 31,2018 Year endedDecember 31,2017 U.S. Dollar 58 % 57 % 59 % Euro 10 % 11 % 10 % Other Currencies 32 % 32 % 31 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 41 As a result, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact our operating results.
Impacts associated with fluctuations in foreign currency are discussed in more detail under “Item 7A.—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.” In countries with currencies other than the U.S. dollar, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using end-of-period exchange rates; revenues, expenses and cash flows are translated using average rates of exchange.
The average U.S. dollar to Euro exchange rate was $1.12 to €1.00, $1.18 to €1.00 and $1.13 to €1.00 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Constant currency growth rates used in the following discussion of results of operations eliminate the impact of year-over-year foreign currency fluctuations.
We evaluate our results of operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis.
The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of year-over-year fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
We believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our results of operations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our business performance and is consistent with how management evaluates the Company’s performance.
We calculate constant currency percentages by converting our prior-period local currency financial results using the current period exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current period reported results.
This calculation may differ from similarly-titled measures used by others and, accordingly, the constant currency presentation is not meant to be a substitution for recorded amounts presented in conformity with GAAP nor should such amounts be considered in isolation.
Operations in Argentina We have operations in both the Connect and Media segments in Argentina and the functional currency for those operations is the Argentine Peso.
In accordance with U.S. GAAP, Argentina’s currency has been considered hyperinflationary since July 1, 2018, and, accordingly, local currency transactions have been denominated in U.S. dollars since July 1, 2018, and will continue to be denominated in U.S. dollars until Argentina’s currency is no longer deemed to be hyperinflationary.
We will continue to assess the appropriate conversion rate based on events in Argentina and our Argentina operations.
This event has had an immaterial impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
Results of Operations – Years Ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the amounts included in our consolidated statements of operations: Year Ended December 31, (IN MILLIONS) 2019 2018 2017 Revenues $ 6,498 $ 6,515 $ 6,572 Cost of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below 2,822 2,805 2,765 Selling, general and administrative expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below 1,929 1,958 1,873 Depreciation and amortization 756 675 640 Impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets 1,004 1,413 — Restructuring charges 80 139 80 Operating income/(loss) (93 ) (475 ) 1,214 Interest income 6 8 4 Interest expense (397 ) (394 ) (374 ) Foreign currency exchange transaction gains/(losses), net (10 ) (16 ) (10 ) Other income/(expense), net (169 ) (5 ) (6 ) Income/(loss) before income taxes and equity in net income/(loss) of affiliates (663 ) (882 ) 828 Benefit/(provision) for income taxes 260 182 (388 ) Net income/(loss) (403 ) (700 ) 440 Net income/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 12 12 11 Net income/(loss) attributable to Nielsen shareholders $ (415 ) $ (712 ) $ 429 42 Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss from our consolidated statements of operations before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, restructuring charges, impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, share-based compensation expense and other non-operating items from our consolidated statements of operations as well as certain other items considered outside the normal course of our operations specifically described below.
Restructuring charges: We exclude restructuring expenses, which primarily include employee severance, office consolidation and contract termination charges, from our Adjusted EBITDA to allow more accurate comparisons of the financial results to historical operations and forward-looking guidance.
By excluding these expenses from our non-GAAP measures, we are better able to evaluate our ability to utilize our existing assets and estimate the long-term value these assets will generate for us.
Furthermore, we believe that the adjustments of these items more closely correlate with the sustainability of our operating performance.
Impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets: We exclude the impact of charges related to the impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets.
Given the significance of the impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, we reported it separately in the consolidated statements of operations.
We believe that the exclusion of these impairments, which are non-cash, allows for meaningful comparisons of operating results to peer companies.
We believe that this increases period-to-period comparability and is useful to evaluate the performance of the total company.
Share-based compensation expense: We exclude the impact of costs relating to share-based compensation.
Due to the subjective assumptions and a variety of award types, we believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense, which is typically non-cash, allows for more meaningful comparisons of our operating results to peer companies.
Share-based compensation expense can vary significantly based on the timing, size and nature of awards granted.
Other non-operating income/(expense), net: We exclude foreign currency exchange transaction gains and losses, primarily related to intercompany financing arrangements, as well as other non-operating income and expense items, such as gains and losses recorded on business combinations or dispositions, sales of investments, pension settlements, net income/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and early redemption payments made in connection with debt refinancing.
We believe that the adjustments of these items more closely correlate with the sustainability of our operating performance.
Other items: To measure operating performance, we exclude certain expenses and gains that arise outside the ordinary course of our operations.
Such costs primarily include legal settlements, acquisition related expenses, business optimization costs and other transactional costs.
We believe the exclusion of such amounts allows management and the users of the financial statements to better understand our financial results.
Adjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP, and our use of the term Adjusted EBITDA may vary from the use of similarly-titled measures by others in our industry due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period expressed as a percentage of revenues for that period.
We use Adjusted EBITDA to measure our performance from period to period both at the consolidated level as well as within our operating segments, to evaluate and fund incentive compensation programs and to compare our results to those of our competitors.
In addition to Adjusted EBITDA being a significant measure of performance for management purposes, we also believe that this presentation provides useful information to investors regarding financial and business trends related to our results of operations and that when non-GAAP financial information is viewed with GAAP financial information, investors are provided with a more meaningful understanding of our ongoing operating performance.
Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss, operating income/(loss), cash flows from operating activities or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or cash flows as measures of liquidity.
Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.
In addition, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies and may, therefore, have limitations as a comparative analytical tool.
43 The below table presents a reconciliation from net income/(loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017: Year Ended December 31, (IN MILLIONS) 2019 2018 2017 Net income/(loss) attributable to Nielsen shareholders $ (415 ) $ (712 ) $ 429 Interest expense, net 391 386 370 (Benefit)/provision for income taxes (260 ) (182 ) 388 Depreciation and amortization 756 675 640 EBITDA 472 167 1,827 Other non-operating (income)/expense, net(b) 191 33 27 Restructuring charges 80 139 80 Impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets 1,004 1,413 - Share-based compensation expense 50 35 45 Other items(a) 56 63 45 Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,853 $ 1,850 $ 2,024 (a) For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 other items primarily consists of business optimization costs, including strategic review costs and transaction related costs.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, other items primarily consists of transaction related costs and business optimization costs.
(b) For the year ended December 31, 2019, other non-operating (income)/expense, net, included non-cash expenses of $170 million for pension settlements which included plan transfers to third parties in the Netherlands and UK, where we terminated our responsibility for future defined benefit obligations and transferred that responsibility to the third parties.
See Note 11 “Pensions and Other Post-Retirement Benefits” for more information.
Consolidated Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018 Revenues Revenues decreased 0.3% to $6,498 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $6,515 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or an increase of 1.7% on a constant currency basis.
Revenues within our Connect segment decreased 2.6%, or an increase of 0.7% on a constant currency basis.
Revenues within our Media segment increased 1.9%, or an increase of 2.6% on a constant currency basis.
Refer to the “Business Segment Results” section for further discussion of our revenue performance.

Costs within our Media segment increased 8.3%, or an increase of 9.7% on a constant currency basis.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased on a constant currency basis primarily due to the impact of our investments.
44 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense was $756 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $675 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
This increase was primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization expense associated with capital expenditures, partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization expense associated with assets acquired in business combinations.
Depreciation and amortization expense associated with tangible and intangibles assets acquired in business combinations decreased to $205 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $220 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Impairment of Goodwill and other Long-Lived Assets During 2019, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $1,004 million.
This charge was recorded within our Connect reporting unit.
During 2018, we recorded an impairment of goodwill and other long-lived asset charge of $1,413 million, primarily related to a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $1,411 million.
This charge was recorded primarily within our Connect reporting unit.
Restructuring Charges We recorded $80 million and $139 million in restructuring charges, primarily related to employee severance costs associated with our plans to reduce selling, general and administrative expenses and consolidate operations centers, as well as automation initiatives for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Operating Income/(loss) Operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $93 million compared to operating loss of $475 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Operating loss within our Connect segment was $877 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to operating loss of $1,329 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Operating income within our Media segment decreased to $930 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $998 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Corporate operating expenses increased to $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $144 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Interest Expense Interest expense was $397 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $394 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
This increase was primarily due to slightly higher USD LIBOR interest rates on our senior secured term loans without hedged positions and a higher EURO denominated debt balance.
Foreign Currency Exchange Transaction Gains/(Losses), Net Foreign currency exchange transaction losses, net, represent the net loss on revaluation of certain cash, external debt, intercompany loans and other receivables and payables.
Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar, particularly the Euro, have a significant effect on our operating results.
The average U.S. Dollar to Euro exchange rate was $1.12 to €1.00 and $1.18 to €1.00 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
We realized net losses of $10 million and $16 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, resulting primarily from fluctuations in certain foreign currencies associated with intercompany transactions.
Other Income/(Expense), Net Other expense, net of $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily related to a non-cash expense of $170 million for pension settlements which included plan transfers to third parties in the Netherlands and UK, where we terminated our responsibility for future defined benefit obligations and transferred that responsibility to the third parties.
See Note 11 “Pensions and Other Post-Retirement Benefits” for more information.
Other expense, net of $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily related to certain costs incurred in connection with the September 2018 debt refinancing as well as the write-off of certain previously capitalized deferred financing fees in conjunction with the refinancing, partially offset by certain non-service related pension amounts.
45 Income/(Loss) Before Income Taxes and Equity in Net Income of Affiliates Loss was $663 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a loss of $882 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 due primarily to the consolidated results mentioned above.
Income Taxes The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were 39% and 21%, respectively.
Our effective tax rate benefit of 39% for the year ended December 31, 2019 was higher than the UK statutory rate as a result of the impact of goodwill impairment, tax rate differences in other jurisdictions where the Company files tax returns, post-retirement settlements, and withholding and foreign taxes as well as state and local income taxes offset by the favorable impact of changes in estimates for uncertain tax positions and audit settlements, decreases in valuation allowances, the effect of global licensing activities, and certain financing activities.
Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was higher than the UK statutory rate as a result of the impact of goodwill impairment, tax rate differences in other jurisdictions where the Company files tax returns, the effect of global licensing activities, withholding and foreign taxes as well as state and local income taxes, changes in estimates for uncertain tax positions, and increases in valuation allowances offset by the favorable impact of the TCJA adjustments, certain financing activities, and intercompany restructuring.
At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had gross uncertain tax positions of $164 million and $572 million, respectively.
We also have accrued interest and penalties associated with these uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 of $25 million and $70 million, respectively.
Estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes is classified as a component of our provision or benefit for income taxes.
It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months certain tax examinations will close, which could result in a change in unrecognized tax benefits, along with related interest and penalties.
Furthermore, the amounts ultimately paid may differ from the amounts accrued.
An estimate of any possible change cannot be made at this time.
Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where statutory rates are lower and earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where statutory rates are higher, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof.
Other factors that may affect our effective income tax rate include, but are not limited to, losses in jurisdictions where no income tax benefit can be recognized, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the establishment of valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets if we determined that it is more likely than not that future income tax benefits will not be realized, and audits by taxing authorities.
Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA increased 0.2% to $1,853 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $1,850 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or an increase of 1.4% on a constant currency basis.
Our Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 28.52% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 28.40% for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased due to productivity initiatives.
Costs within our Media segment increased 12.1%, or an increase of 10.9% on a constant currency basis.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to the impact of our investments.
Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense was $675 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $640 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
This increase was primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization expense associated with higher capital expenditures.
Depreciation and amortization expense associated with tangible and intangibles assets acquired in business combinations increased to $220 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $219 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Impairment of Goodwill and other Long-Lived Assets During 2018, we recorded an impairment of goodwill and other long-lived asset charge of $1,413 million, primarily related to a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $1,411 million in our Connect reporting unit.
Restructuring Charges We recorded $139 million and $80 million in restructuring charges, primarily related to employee severance costs associated with our plans to reduce selling, general and administrative expenses and consolidate operations centers, as well as automation initiatives for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Operating Income/(loss) Operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $475 million compared to operating income of $1,214 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Operating loss within our Connect segment was $1,329 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to operating income of $336 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Operating income within our Media segment decreased to $998 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $1,021 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Corporate operating expenses increased to $144 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $143 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Interest Expense Interest expense was $394 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $374 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
This increase was primarily due to higher USD LIBOR interest rates on our senior secured term loans without hedged positions.
Foreign Currency Exchange Transaction Gains/(Losses), Net Foreign currency exchange transaction losses, net, represent the net loss on revaluation of certain cash, external debt, intercompany loans and other receivables and payables.
Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar, particularly the Euro, have a significant effect on our operating results.
The average U.S. Dollar to Euro exchange rate was $1.18 to €1.00 and $1.13 to €1.00 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
We realized net losses of $16 million and $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, receptively, resulting primarily from fluctuations in certain foreign currencies associated with intercompany transactions.
47 Other Income/(Expense), Net Other expense, net of $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily related to certain costs incurred in connection with the June 2018 debt refinancing discussed below under “Liquidity and Capital Resources”, as well as the write-off of certain previously capitalized deferred financing fees in conjunction with the refinancing, partially offset by certain pension related amounts reclassified from operating expense as a result of our adoption of ASU “ Compensation — Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.” See “Summary of Recent Accounting Pronouncements” below for more information.
Other expense, net of $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily related to the finalization of working capital and other matters associated with dispositions, partially offset by certain pension related amounts reclassified from operating expense as a result of our adoption of ASU “Compensation — Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.” See “Summary of Recent Accounting Pronouncements” below for more information.
Income/(Loss) Before Income Taxes and Equity in Net Income of Affiliates Loss was $882 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to income of $828 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 due primarily to the consolidated results mentioned above.
Income Taxes The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were 21% and 47%, respectively.
Our effective tax rate benefit of 21% for the year ended December 31, 2018 was higher than the UK statutory rate as a result of the impact of goodwill impairment, tax rate differences in other jurisdictions where the Company files tax returns, the effect of global licensing activities, withholding and foreign taxes as well as state and local income taxes, changes in estimates for uncertain tax positions, and increases in valuation allowances offset by the favorable impact of the TCJA adjustments, certain financing activities, and intercompany restructuring.
Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was higher than the UK statutory rate as a result of the impact of the TCJA as well as tax rate differences in other jurisdictions where the Company files tax returns, the effect of global licensing activities, withholding and foreign taxes as well as state and local income taxes, offset by the favorable impact of certain financing activities and releases of valuation allowances.
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had gross uncertain tax positions of $572 million and $452 million, respectively.
We also have accrued interest and penalties associated with these uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 of $70 million and $53 million, respectively.
Estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes is classified as a component of our provision or benefit for income taxes.
It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months certain tax examinations will close, which could result in a change in unrecognized tax benefits, along with related interest and penalties.
Furthermore, the amounts ultimately paid may differ from the amounts accrued.
An estimate of any possible change cannot be made at this time.
Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where statutory rates are lower and earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where statutory rates are higher, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof.
Other factors that may affect our effective income tax rate include, but are not limited to, losses in jurisdictions where no income tax benefit can be recognized, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the establishment of valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets if we determined that it is more likely than not that future income tax benefits will not be realized, and audits by taxing authorities.
Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA decreased 8.6% to $1,850 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $2,024 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 7.9% on a constant currency basis.
Our Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 28.40% for the year ended December 31, 2018 from 30.80% for the year ended December 31, 2017.
See “Results of Operations – Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016” for the reconciliation of net income/(loss) to Adjusted EBITDA.
48 Business Segment Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018 Revenues The table below sets forth our segment revenue performance data for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, both on an as-reported and constant currency basis.

Revenues from Measure decreased 2.3% to $2,161 million, or an increase of 1.4% on a constant currency basis.
Revenue growth on a constant currency basis was driven by stronger performance in our retail measurement services and improved trends in Emerging Markets.
Revenues from Predict/Activate decreased 3.3% to $896 million, or a decrease of 0.9% on a constant currency basis.
Revenues decreased as a result of pressure in innovation and custom insights, partially offset by improvement in custom analytics.
Media Segment Revenues Revenues increased 1.9% to $3,441 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $3,377 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, or an increase of 2.6% on a constant currency basis.
Revenue growth was primarily driven by growth in Audience Measurement, which increased 2.5%, or an increase of 3.0% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to continued client adoption of our Total Audience Measurement system, partly offset by pressure in local television measurement.
Plan/Optimize revenues increased 0.4%, or an increase of 1.6% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by growth in Gracenote and outcome-based solutions, partially offset by pressure in Telecom.
49 Business Segment Profitability We do not allocate items below operating income/(loss) to our business segments and therefore the tables below set forth a reconciliation of operating income/(loss) at the business segment level for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, adjusting for certain items affecting operating income/(loss), such as restructuring charges, depreciation and amortization, impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assts, share-based compensation expense and certain other items described below resulting in a presentation of our non-GAAP business segment profitability.
Non-GAAP business segment profitability provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends related to our results of operations.
When this non-GAAP financial information is viewed with our GAAP financial information, investors are provided with a meaningful understanding of our ongoing operating performance.
It is important to note that the non-GAAP business segment profitability corresponds in total to our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA described within our consolidated results of operations above, which our chief operating decision maker and other members of management use to measure our performance from period to period both at the consolidated level as well as within our operating segments, to evaluate and fund incentive compensation programs and to compare our results to those of our competitors.
These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income/(loss), operating income/(loss), cash flows from operating activities or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or cash flows as measures of liquidity.
These non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly-titled measures used by others and have important limitations as analytical tools.
Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.

Revenues from Measure decreased 1.0% to $2,211 million, or a decrease of 0.5% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by pressure on spending from large multinational clients and competitive impacts in the U.S.
Revenues from Predict/Activate decreased 11.3% to $927 million, or a decrease of 10.9% on a constant currency basis.
Revenues decreased as a result of softness in areas such as innovation and custom analytics.
Media Segment Revenues Revenues increased 2.5% to $3,377 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $3,294 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or an increase of 2.4% on a constant currency basis.
Revenue growth was primarily driven by growth in Audience Measurement, which increased 3.9%, or an increase of 3.8% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to continued client adoption of our Total Audience Measurement system, partly offset by pressure in local television measurement.
Plan/Optimize revenues decreased 0.7%, or a decrease of 0.9% on a constant currency basis.
Revenues decreased as a result of pressure in Telecom and a historical data sale related to an exited product category in the fourth quarter of 2017.
These were partially offset by investments including Gracenote and audience-based solutions that help advertisers and publishers measure the return on investment in media spend.
51 Business Segment Profitability We do not allocate items below operating income/(loss) to our business segments and therefore the tables below set forth a reconciliation of operating income/(loss) at the business segment level for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, adjusting for certain items affecting operating income/(loss), such as restructuring charges, depreciation and amortization, impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, share-based compensation expense and certain other items described below resulting in a presentation of our non-GAAP business segment profitability.
Non-GAAP business segment profitability provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends related to our results of operations.
When this non-GAAP financial information is viewed with our GAAP financial information, investors are provided with a meaningful understanding of our ongoing operating performance.
It is important to note that the non-GAAP business segment profitability corresponds in total to our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA described within our consolidated results of operations above, which our chief operating decision maker and other members of management use to measure our performance from period to period both at the consolidated level as well as within our operating segments, to evaluate and fund incentive compensation programs and to compare our results to those of our competitors.
These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income/(loss), operating income/(loss), cash flows from operating activities or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or cash flows as measures of liquidity.
These non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly-titled measures used by others and have important limitations as analytical tools.
Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.

Non-GAAP business segment income decreased 28.2% on a constant currency basis.
52 Media Segment Profitability Operating income was $998 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $1,021 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The decrease was driven by higher restructuring costs, higher depreciation and amortization expense and investments in our services, partially offset by the revenue performance discussed above.
Non-GAAP business segment income increased 0.5% on a constant currency basis.
Corporate Expenses and Eliminations Operating expenses were $144 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $143 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase in transaction related costs and business optimization costs and depreciation and amortization expense partially offset by lower share-based compensation expense and lower restructuring charges.
Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows from operations provided a source of funds of $1,066 million, $1,058 million and $1,310 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
This increase was driven primarily by lower employee annual incentive payments, lower retailer investments and lower restructuring payments, partially offset by working capital timing and higher interest and tax payments during the year ended December 31, 2019.
We provide for additional liquidity through several sources, including maintaining an adequate cash balance, access to global funding sources and a committed revolving credit facility.
The following table provides a summary of the major sources of liquidity for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017: (IN MILLIONS) 2019 2018 2017 Net cash from operating activities $ 1,066 $ 1,058 $ 1,310 Cash and short-term marketable securities $ 454 $ 524 $ 656 Revolving credit facility $ 850 $ 850 $ 575 Of the $454 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2019, approximately $383 million was held in jurisdictions outside the U.S. We regularly review the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. to determine the amounts necessary to fund the current operations of our foreign operations and their growth initiatives and amounts needed to service our U.S. indebtedness and related obligations.
The below table illustrates our weighted average interest rate and cash paid for interest over the last three years.

We believe we will have available resources to meet both our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, including our senior secured debt service.
We expect the cash flow from our operations, combined with existing cash and amounts available under the revolving credit facility, will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations, projected working capital requirements, restructuring obligations, dividend payments and capital spending over the next year.
In addition, we may, from time to time, purchase, repay, redeem or retire any of our outstanding debt securities (including any publicly issued debt securities) in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise.

We believe that it is probable that we will be able to refinance this debt prior to maturity.
Term Loan Facilities In June 2018, we entered into an Amendment Agreement to amend and restate our Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Prior Credit Agreement”) in the form of the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Amended Credit Agreement”).
Among other things, the Amendment Agreement provided for: (i) the refinancing and replacement of the prior Tranche A Revolving Credit Facility with a new Tranche A Revolving Credit Facility having commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $850,000,000; (ii) the refinancing and replacement of the prior Class A Term Loans with new Class A Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of $1,125,000,000; (iii) the refinancing and replacement of the prior Class B-2 Euro Term Loans with new Class B-2 Euro Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of € 545,245,518; and (iv) incurring incremental term loans in the form of Class B-4 Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of $75,000,000.
The proceeds of loans under each replacement facility were used to replace or refinance the entire outstanding principal amount of loans under the prior facility that was replaced, and the proceeds of the incremental Class B-4 Term Loans, together with a portion of the proceeds of the Class B-2 Euro Term Loans in excess of the amount of the prior Class B-2 Euro Term Loans that were replaced, were used to prepay the amount of prior Class A Term Loans in excess of the amount of new Class A Term Loans.
54 The new Class A Term Loans will mature in full on July 9, 2023 and are required to be repaid in quarterly installments in an aggregate amount equal to 0.63% of the original principal amount of the Class A Term Loans for each of the first eight quarters following the effective date of the Amendment Agreement, 1.25% of the original principal amount of the Class A Term Loans for each of the subsequent eight quarters and 2.50% of the original principal amount of the Class A Term Loans for each of the subsequent three quarters, with the balance payable on July 9, 2023.
The new Class B-2 Euro Term Loans will mature in full on October 4, 2023 and are required to be repaid in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate amount equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Class B-2 Euro Term Loans, with the balance payable on October 4, 2023.
The Class B-4 Term Loans will mature in full on October 4, 2023 and are required to be repaid in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate amount equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Class B-4 Term Loans, with the balance payable on October 4, 2023.
The new Tranche A Revolving Credit Facility matures on July 9, 2023.
The new Class A Term Loans and loans under the new Tranche A Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our election, (i) a base rate or eurocurrency rate, plus (ii) an applicable margin determined by reference to the Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), which varies from 0.25% to 1.00%, in the case of base rate loans, and from 1.25% to 2.00%, in the case of eurocurrency rate loans.
The Class B-2 Euro Term Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) a eurocurrency rate plus (ii) an applicable margin equal to 2.50%.
The Class B-4 Term Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our election, (i) a base rate or eurocurrency rate, plus (ii) an applicable margin, which is equal to 2.00%, in the case of eurocurrency loans, or 1.00%, in the case of base rate loans.
The Amended Credit Agreement contains substantially the same affirmative and negative covenants as those of the Prior Credit Agreement, except the exceptions to the restrictions on restricted payments and investments that are determined by reference to the Total Leverage Ratio were amended to increase the applicable limits.
Obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are guaranteed by TNC B.V., substantially all of the wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries of TNC B.V. and certain of the non-U.S. wholly-owned subsidiaries of TNC B.V., and are secured by substantially all of the existing and future property and assets of the U.S. subsidiaries of TNC B.V. and by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of the guarantors, the capital stock of substantially all of the U.S. subsidiaries of TNC B.V., and up to 65% of the capital stock of certain of the non-U.S. subsidiaries of TNC B.V.
Under a separate security agreement, substantially all of the assets of TNC B.V. are pledged as collateral for amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement.
Covenants The Amended Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of Nielsen Holding and Finance B.V. and its restricted subsidiaries (which together constitute most of our subsidiaries) to incur additional indebtedness or guarantees, incur liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions, make certain loans and investments, declare dividends, make payments or redeem or repurchase capital stock, engage in certain mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations, prepay, redeem or purchase certain indebtedness, amend or otherwise alter terms of certain indebtedness, sell certain assets, transact with affiliates, enter into agreements limiting subsidiary distributions and alter the business they conduct.
These entities are restricted, subject to certain exceptions, in their ability to transfer their net assets to us.
Such restricted net assets amounted to approximately $2.1 billion at December 31, 2019.
In addition, these entities are subject to a total leverage covenant.
The leverage ratio requires that we not permit the ratio of total net debt (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) at the end of any calendar quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) for the four quarters then ended to exceed a specified threshold.
The maximum permitted ratio is 5.50 to 1.00.
Neither we nor TNC B.V. is currently bound by any financial or negative covenants contained in the Amended Credit Agreement.
The Amended Credit Agreement also contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default.
Certain significant financial covenants are described further below.
Failure to comply with this financial covenant would result in an event of default under our Amended Credit Agreement unless waived by certain of our term lenders and our revolving lenders.
An event of default under our Amended Credit Agreement can result in the acceleration of our indebtedness under the facilities, which in turn would result in an event of default and possible acceleration of indebtedness under the agreements governing our debt securities as well.
As our failure to comply with the financial covenant described above can cause us to go into default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, management believes that our Amended Credit Agreement and this covenant are material to us.
As of December 31, 2019, we were in full compliance with the financial covenant described above.
Pursuant to our Amended Credit Agreement, we are subject to making mandatory prepayments on the term loans within our Amended Credit Agreement to the extent in any full calendar year we generate Excess Cash Flow (“ECF”), as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement.
The percentage of ECF that must be applied as a repayment is a function of several factors, including our ratio of total net debt to Covenant EBITDA, as well other adjustments, including any voluntary term loan repayments made in the course of the calendar year.
To the extent any mandatory repayment is required pursuant to this ECF clause; such payment must generally occur on or around the time of the delivery of the annual consolidated financial statements to the lenders.
At December 31, 2019, our ratio of total net debt to Covenant EBITDA was less than 5.00 to 1.00 and therefore no mandatory repayment was required.
Our next ECF measurement date will occur upon completion of the 2020 results, and although we do not expect to be required to issue any mandatory repayments in 2020 or beyond, it is uncertain at this time if any such payments will be required in future periods.
55 Revolving Credit Facility The Amended Credit Agreement contains a senior secured revolving credit facility with aggregate revolving credit commitments of $850 million and a final maturity of July 2023 under which Nielsen Finance LLC, TNC (US) Holdings, Inc., and Nielsen Holding and Finance B.V. can borrow revolving loans.
The revolving credit facility can also be used for letters of credit, guarantees and swingline loans.
The senior secured revolving credit facility is provided under the Amended Credit Agreement and so contains covenants and restrictions as noted above with respect to the Amended Credit Agreement.
Obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by the same entities that guarantee obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement.
As of December 31, 2019, we had zero borrowings outstanding and outstanding letters of credit of $17 million.
As of December 31, 2018, we had zero borrowings outstanding and outstanding letters of credit of $16 million.
As of December 31, 2019, we had $833 million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility.
Debenture Loans The indentures governing certain of our debenture loans limit the majority of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase our capital stock, make certain investments, enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, use assets as security in other transactions and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies subject to certain exceptions.
Upon a change in control, we are required to make an offer to redeem all of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to the 101% of the aggregate accreted principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.
The Senior Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by Nielsen Holdings plc, substantially all of the wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries of Nielsen Holdings plc, and certain of the non-U.S. wholly-owned subsidiaries of Nielsen Holdings plc.
Dividends and Share Repurchase Program We continue to drive shareholder value through our quarterly cash dividend policy which was adopted by our Board of Directors ("Board" in 2013.
Under this plan we have paid $395 million and $494 million in cash dividends during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
On November 3, 2019, the Board approved a plan to reduce the quarterly cash dividend, with the goal of strengthening our balance sheet and providing added flexibility to invest for growth.
Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board and will be subject to the Board’s continuing determination that the dividend policy and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders, and are in compliance with all laws and agreements to which we are subject.
The below table summarizes the dividends declared on our common stock during 2018 and 2019.
Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date Dividend Per Share February 21, 2018 March 7, 2018 March 21, 2018 $ 0.34 April 19, 2018 June 6, 2018 June 20, 2018 $ 0.35 July 19, 2018 August 22, 2018 September 5, 2018 $ 0.35 October 18, 2018 November 21, 2018 December 5, 2018 $ 0.35 February 21, 2019 March 7, 2019 March 21, 2019 $ 0.35 April 18, 2019 June 5, 2019 June 19, 2019 $ 0.35 July 18, 2019 August 22, 2019 September 5, 2019 $ 0.35 November 3, 2019 November 21, 2019 December 5, 2019 $ 0.06 On February 20, 2020, our Board declared a cash dividend of $0.06 per share on our common stock.
The dividend is payable on March 19, 2020 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 5, 2020.
56 Our Board approved a share repurchase program, as included in the below table, for up to $2 billion of our outstanding common stock.
The primary purpose of the program is to return value to shareholders and to mitigate dilution associated with our equity compensation plans.
Board Approval Share Repurchase Authorization ($ in millions) July 25, 2013 $ 500 October 23, 2014 1,000 December 11, 2015 500 Total Share Repurchase Authorization $ 2,000 Repurchases under these plans will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws from time to time in the open market or otherwise depending on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors.
This program has been executed within the limitations of the authority granted by our shareholders.
As of December 31, 2019, there have been 39,426,521 shares of our common stock purchased at an average price of $44.95 per share (total consideration of approximately $1,772 million) under this program.
There were no share repurchases for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Cash Flows 2019 versus 2018 Operating activities.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,066 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $1,058 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
This increase was driven primarily by lower employee annual incentive payments, lower retailer investments and lower restructuring payments, partially offset by working capital timing and higher interest and tax payments during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Our key collections performance measure, days billing outstanding (DBO), decreased by 3 days as compared to the same period last year.
Investing activities.
Net cash used in investing activities was $582 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $506 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The increase was primarily driven by increased acquisition payments, a decrease in proceeds received from the sale of subsidiaries and affiliates, and the purchase of an equity investment during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to 2018. Financing activities.
Net cash used in financing activities was $544 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $676 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to lower dividend payments and share repurchasing, as described in the “Dividends and Share Repurchase Program” section above, partially offset by an increase in net payments from the repayment and issuance of debt during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the same period of 2018.
Cash Flows 2018 versus 2017 Operating activities.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,058 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $1,310 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
This decrease was driven primarily by the Adjusted EBITDA performance discussed above, higher interest payments during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the full year impact of a 2017 bond issuance and higher USD LIBOR senior secured term loan interest rates, partially offset by lower tax payments.
Our key collections performance measure, days billing outstanding (DBO), stayed consistent for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
Investing activities.
Net cash used in investing activities was $506 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $1,236 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The decrease was primarily driven by decreased acquisition payments, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 2017. Financing activities.
Net cash used in financing activities was $676 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $215 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to decreased net proceeds from the issuance and repayment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2018, higher dividend payments, as described in the “Dividends and Share Repurchase Program” section above, and an increase in finance lease financing, partially offset by lower share repurchasing, as described in the “Dividends and Share Repurchase Program” section above during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the same period of 2017.
57 Capital Expenditures Investments in property, plant, equipment, software and other assets totaled $519 million, $520 million and $489 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
In addition, the Company received zero, $4 million and $42 million of proceeds from the sale of certain property, plant and equipment and other assets during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Commitments and Contingencies Outsourced Services Agreements In July 2019, we amended our Second Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement (the “MSA”), dated as of October 1, 2017 and effective as of January 1, 2017 (the “Effective Date”), with Tata America International Corporation and Tata Consultancy Services Limited (jointly, “TCS”) by executing Amendment Number One (the “Amendment”) with TCS, dated as of July 1, 2019 and effective as of January 1, 2019 (the “Amendment Effective Date”).
The Amendment reduces the amount of services we have committed to purchase from TCS from the Amendment Effective Date through the remaining term of the MSA (the “Minimum Commitment”) to $1.413 billion, including a commitment to purchase at least $275 million in services during 2019, at least $250 million in services during 2020, $184.3 million in services per year from 2021 through 2024, and $137.8 million in services in 2025 (in each of the foregoing cases, the “Annual Commitment”).
TCS’s charges under existing and future statements of work (“SOW”) pursuant to the MSA will continue to be credited against the Minimum Commitment and the Annual Commitment and the occurrence of certain events, some of which also provide us with the right to terminate the Agreement or SOWs, as applicable, will continue to be available to reduce the Minimum and Annual Commitment Amounts as they occur.
The parties also agreed to certain other commercial terms.
However, the other material terms of the MSA as reflected in the MSA and as previously disclosed remain unchanged.
As of December 31, 2019, the remaining TCS commitment was approximately $1.1 billion.
Other Contractual Obligations Our other contractual obligations include finance lease obligations (including interest portion), facility leases, leases of certain computer and other equipment, agreements to purchase data and telecommunication services, the payment of principal and interest on debt and pension fund obligations.
At December 31, 2019, the minimum annual payments under these agreements and other contracts that had initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year are as listed in the following table.
Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax positions at December 31, 2019, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of any potential cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities.
Therefore, $189 million in uncertain tax positions (which includes interest and penalties of $25 million) have been excluded from the contractual obligations table below.
See Note 15 – “Income Taxes” – to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes.

We generally require purchase orders for vendor and third party spending.
The amounts presented above represent the minimum future annual services covered by purchase obligations including data processing, building maintenance, equipment purchasing, photocopiers, land and mobile telephone service, computer software and hardware maintenance, and outsourcing.
Our remaining commitments as of December 31, 2019, under the outsourced services agreement with TCS have been included above based on the Annual Commitment minimum required payments.
As of December 31, 2019, the remaining TCS commitment was approximately $1.1 billion.
(d) Interest payments consists of interest on both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt based on LIBOR as of December 31, 2019.
(e) Our contributions to pension and other post-retirement defined benefit plans were $28 million, $29 million and $21 million during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Future minimum pension and other post-retirement benefits contributions are not determinable for time periods after 2020.
See Note 11 – “Pensions and Other Post-Retirement Benefits” – to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion on plan obligations.
Guarantees and Other Contingent Commitments At December 31, 2019, we were committed under the following significant guarantee arrangements: Sub-lease guarantees.
We provide sub-lease guarantees in accordance with certain agreements pursuant to which we guarantee
 all rental payments upon default of rental payment by the sub-lessee.
To date, we have not been required to perform under such arrangements, and do not anticipate making any significant payments related to such guarantees and, accordingly, no amounts have been recorded.
Letters of credit.
Letters of credit issued and outstanding amount to $17 million at December 31, 2019.
Legal Proceedings and Contingencies In August 2018, a putative shareholder class action lawsuit was filed in the Southern District of New York, naming as defendants Nielsen, former Chief Executive Officer Dwight Mitchell Barns, and former Chief Financial Officer Jamere Jackson.
Another lawsuit, which alleged similar facts but also named other Nielsen officers, was filed in the Northern District of Illinois in September 2018 and transferred to the Southern District of New York in December 2018.
The actions were consolidated on April 22, 2019, and the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi was appointed lead plaintiff for the putative class.
The operative complaint was filed on September 27, 2019, and asserts violations of certain provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, based on allegedly false and materially misleading statements relating to the outlook of our Buy (now “Connect”) segment, our preparedness for changes in global data privacy laws and our reliance on third-party data.
We moved to dismiss the operative complaint on November 26, 2019.
Briefing of our motion is scheduled to conclude on February 26, 2020.
In addition, in January 2019, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in New York Supreme Court against a number of our current and former officers and directors.
The derivative lawsuit alleges that the named officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties to us in connection with factual assertions substantially similar to those in the putative class action complaints.
The derivative lawsuit further alleges that certain officers and directors engaged in trading our stock based on material, nonpublic information.
By agreement dated June 26, 2019, the derivative lawsuit has been stayed pending resolution of our motion to dismiss the aforementioned securities litigation.
We intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously.
Based on currently available information, we believe that we have meritorious defenses to these actions and that their resolution is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, or results of operations.
We are subject to litigation and other claims in the ordinary course of business, some of which include claims for substantial sums.
Accruals have been recorded when the outcome is probable and can be reasonably estimated.
While the ultimate results of claims and litigation cannot be determined, we expect that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition.
However, depending on the amount and the timing, an unfavorable resolution of some or all of these matters could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Except as disclosed above, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that currently have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditure or capital resources.
59 Summary of Recent Accounting Pronouncements Leases Effective January 1, 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting standard using the transition method approved by the FASB on July 30, 2018, which allows companies to apply the provisions of the new leasing standard as of January 1, 2019, without adjusting the comparative periods presented.
In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard.
This allowed us to carry forward the historical lease classification.
Adoption of this standard resulted in the recording of net operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets of $0.5 billion (amount is net of lease incentives and ASC 420 cease-use liabilities) and corresponding operating lease liabilities of $0.6 billion.
Financial position for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 are presented under the new guidance, while prior periods amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with previous guidance.
See Note 5 (“Leases”) for further discussion.
Income taxes In February 2018, the FASB issued an ASU, “Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects From Accumulated Comprehensive Income”.
The new standard gives companies the option to reclassify stranded tax effects caused by the TCJA from accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) to retained earnings.
The new standard became effective for us on January 1, 2019.
We are electing to not reclassify stranded income tax effects of the TCJA from AOCI to retained earnings.
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses In June 2016, the FASB issued an ASU, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”.
The standard significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income.
The standard will replace today’s “incurred loss” approach with an “expected loss” model for instruments measured at amortized cost.
For available-for-sale debt securities, entities will be required to record allowances rather than reduce the carrying amount, as they do today under the other-than-temporary impairment model.
It also simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans.
The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.
We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Compensation-Retirement Benefits-Defined Benefit Plans-General In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No.
2018-14, Compensation—Retirement Benefits—Defined Benefit Plans—General (Subtopic 715-20), which amends the current disclosure requirements regarding defined benefit pensions and other post retirement plans, and allows for the removal of certain disclosures, while adding certain new disclosure requirements.
This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and allows for early adoption.
We do not expect this new standard to have a significant impact to our disclosures.
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income taxes In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No.
2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes which amends and aims to simplify accounting disclosure requirements regarding a number of topics including: intraperiod tax allocation, accounting for deferred taxes when there are changes in consolidation of certain investments, tax basis step up in an acquisition and the application of effective rate changes during interim periods, amongst other improvements.
This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and allows for early adoption.
We are assessing the impact of this new standard on our consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and our future disclosures.
Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and market prices such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and changes in the market value of equity instruments.
We are exposed to market risk, primarily related to foreign exchange and interest rates.
We actively monitor these exposures.
Historically, in order to manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we entered into a variety of derivative financial instruments, mainly interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and forward rate agreements.
Currently we only employ basic contracts, that is, without options, embedded or otherwise.
Our objective is to reduce, where it is deemed appropriate to do so, fluctuations in earnings, cash flows and the value of our net investments in subsidiaries resulting from changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates.
It is our policy not to trade in financial instruments.
60 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We operate globally and we predominantly generate revenues and expenses in local currencies.
Because of fluctuations (including possible devaluations) in currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into our reporting currency, we are subject to currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations, in addition to transaction exposure.
For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded a net gain of $1 million and a net loss of $2 million, respectively, associated with foreign currency derivative financial instruments within foreign currency exchange transactions gains/(losses), net in our consolidated statements of operations.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency derivative financial instruments were $125 million and $76 million, respectively.
The table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by currency for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018: U.S.
Dollars Euro Other Currencies Year ended December 31, 2019 Revenues 58 % 10 % 32 % Operating costs 56 % 11 % 33 % Year ended December 31, 2018 Revenues 57 % 11 % 32 % Operating costs 57 % 11 % 32 % Based on the year ended December 31, 2019, a one cent change in the U.S. dollar/Euro exchange rate would have impacted revenues by approximately $6 million annually, with an immaterial impact on operating income/(loss).
Operations in Argentina We have operations in both the Connect and Media segments in Argentina and the functional currency for those operations is the Argentine Peso.
In accordance with U.S. GAAP, Argentina’s currency has been considered hyperinflationary since July 1, 2018, and, accordingly, local currency transactions have been denominated in U.S. dollars since July 1, 2018, and will continue to be denominated in U.S. dollars until Argentina’s currency is no longer deemed to be hyperinflationary.
We will continue to assess the appropriate conversion rate based on events in Argentina and our Argentina operations.
This event has had an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Interest Rate Risk We continually review our fixed and variable rate debt along with related hedging opportunities in order to ensure our portfolio is appropriately balanced as part of our overall interest rate risk management strategy and through this process we consider both short-term and long-term considerations in the U.S. and global financial markets in making adjustments to our tolerable exposures to interest rate risk.
At December 31, 2019, we had $3,952 million of floating-rate debt under our senior secured credit facilities, of which $2,050 million was subject to effective floating-fixed interest rate swaps.
A one percent increase in interest rates applied to our floating rate indebtedness would therefore increase annual interest expense by approximately $19 million ($40 million without giving effect to any of our interest rate swaps).
In May 2019, the Company entered into a $150 million aggregate notional amount four-year forward interest rate swap agreement with a starting date of July 9, 2019.
This agreement fixes the LIBOR-related portion of interest rates of a corresponding amount of the Company’s variable-rate-debt at an average rate of 1.82%.
This derivative has been designated as an interest rate cash flow hedge.
In March 2019, the Company entered into a $150 million aggregate notional amount four-year forward interest rate swap agreement with a starting date of April 9, 2019.
This agreement fixes the LIBOR-related portion of interest rates of a corresponding amount of the Company’s variable-rate-debt at an average rate of 2.26%.
This derivative has been designated as an interest rate cash flow hedge.
In March 2019, the Company entered into a $250 million aggregate notional amount four-year forward interest rate swap agreement with a starting date of June 9, 2019.
This agreement fixes the LIBOR-related portion of interest rates of a corresponding amount of the Company’s variable-rate-debt at an average rate of 2.07%.
This derivative has been designated as an interest rate cash flow hedge.
61 In May 2018, the Company entered into $250 million aggregate notional amount of a five-year interest rate swap agreement with a starting date of May 9, 2018.
This agreement fixes the LIBOR-related portion of interest rates of a corresponding amount of the Company’s variable-rate debt at an average rate of 2.72%.
This derivative has been designated as an interest rate cash flow hedge.
In August 2017, the Company entered into $250 million in aggregate notional amount of a four-year forward interest rate swap agreement with a starting date of October 10, 2017.
This agreement fixes the LIBOR-related portion of interest rates of a corresponding amount of the Company’s variable-rate debt at an average rate of 1.60%.
This derivative has been designated as an interest rate cash flow hedge.
In July 2017, the Company entered into $250 million in aggregate notional amount of a three-year forward interest rate swap agreement with a starting date of October 10, 2017.
This agreement fixes the LIBOR-related portion of interest rates of a corresponding amount of the Company’s variable-rate debt at an average rate of 1.66%.
This derivative has been designated as an interest rate cash flow hedge.
In April 2017, the Company entered into $250 million in aggregate notional amount of a three-year forward interest rate swap agreement with a starting date of July 10, 2017.
This agreement fixes the LIBOR-related portion of interest rates of a corresponding amount of the Company’s variable-rate debt at an average rate of 1.63%.
This derivative has been designated as an interest rate cash flow hedge.
In March 2017, the Company entered into $250 million in aggregate notional amount of a five-year forward interest rate swap agreement with a starting date of July 10, 2017.
This agreement fixes the LIBOR-related portion of interest rates of a corresponding amount of the Company’s variable-rate debt at an average rate of 2.00%.
This derivative has been designated as an interest rate cash flow hedge.
In February 2017, the Company entered into $250 million in aggregate notional amount of a three-year forward interest rate swap agreement with a starting date of July 10, 2017.
This agreement fixes the LIBOR-related portion of interest rates of a corresponding amount of the Company’s variable-rate debt at an average rate of 1.73%.
This derivative has been designated as an interest rate cash flow hedge.
Derivative instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of non-performance, or credit risk.
We do not believe that we currently face a significant risk of loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparties associated with these instruments, as these transactions were executed with a diversified group of major financial institutions with a minimum investment-grade or better credit rating.
Our credit risk exposure is managed through the continuous monitoring of our exposures to such counterparties.

Their reports follow.
/s/ David Kenny /s/ Linda Zukauckas David Kenny Linda Zukauckas Chief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer February 27, 2020 February 27, 2020 64 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Nielsen Holdings plc Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Nielsen Holdings plc’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
In our opinion, Nielsen Holdings plc (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income/(loss), shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the Index to Financial Statements in Item 8 and our report dated February 27, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 27, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.
2016-02 As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases in 2019 due to the adoption of ASU No.
2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).
Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits.
We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments.
The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Valuation of Goodwill – Connect Reporting Unit Description of the Matter At December 31, 2019, the Company’s Connect reporting unit goodwill balance is $331 million.
As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that require the performance of an interim impairment assessment.
During 2019, the Company identified events and circumstances that suggested the carrying value of the Connect reporting unit exceeded its fair value.
As a result, the Company performed an interim impairment assessment, concluded that the reporting unit was impaired and recorded a $1 billion impairment charge.
Subsequently, the Company performed its annual impairment test as of October 1, 2019 and concluded that there was no impairment.
Auditing management’s goodwill impairment test involved especially complex and subjective auditor judgment due to the significant estimation required in determining the fair value of the reporting unit.
The estimate of fair value of the Connect reporting unit is determined using a combination of valuation techniques, primarily an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis supplemented by a market-based approach.
The fair value estimate was sensitive to significant assumptions such as the Company’s business projections, long term revenue and EBITDA growth rates and discount rate.
Specifically, the Company’s growth assumptions can be affected adversely by changes in expectations about future market or economic conditions.
66 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s goodwill impairment review process.
For example, we tested controls over the Company’s business projections process as well as controls over the review of the significant assumptions including the long-term revenue and EBITDA growth rates and discount rate.
To test the estimated fair value of the Connect reporting unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis.
We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, changes to the Company’s business model, customer base or product mix.
We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of the significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting unit.
In addition, we reviewed the reconciliation of the fair value of reporting unit to the market capitalization of the Company.
For the market-based approach, we tested the Company’s calculation of implied multiples and compared them to guideline companies.
We involved valuation specialists to assist in our evaluation of the Company's model, valuation methodology and significant assumptions.
Internally Developed Software Description of the Matter As more fully described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company internally develops software to facilitate its global information processing, financial reporting and client access needs.
Costs that are related to the conceptual formulation and design of software programs are expensed as incurred; costs incurred to produce the finished product after technological feasibility are capitalized as an intangible asset.
At December 31, 2019, the net book value of internally developed software is approximately $1.3 billion.
Auditing the Company’s accounting for the capitalization of its internally developed software involves especially challenging and subjective auditor judgment because of the degree of subjectivity involved in assessing which projects met the applicable accounting requirements.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls.
For example, we tested controls over the Company’s process to ensure that projects met applicable requirements for capitalization, that costs being capitalized were appropriate, and that the determination of technological feasibility was appropriate.
Our audit procedures included, among others, testing a sample of projects to verify proper approval and that the timing and nature of costs being capitalized is appropriate.
This included performing inquiries with the project managers to understand the purpose and nature of each project.
Testing was also performed to verify that technological feasibility was met.
This included testing of third-party costs and internal personnel related costs (i.e., payroll) for employees directly associated with the projects.
For projects placed into service, we verified the appropriate transfer of the work-in-process asset to an amortizable asset account.
Recoverability of Deferred Tax Asset Description of the Matter As more fully described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records a valuation allowance based on the assessment of the realizability of the Company’s deferred tax assets.
At December 31, 2019, the Company had deferred tax assets before valuation allowances of $1.4 billion.
Auditing management’s assessment of recoverability of deferred tax assets involved especially challenging and subjective auditor judgment in determining whether the combination of the timing of deferred tax liability reversal and the generation of sufficient future taxable income supports the realization of the Company’s existing deferred tax assets before expiration.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls.
For example, we tested controls over management’s process of evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets including the scheduling of the reversal of existing temporary differences and estimates of future taxable income.
Among other audit procedures performed, we tested the Company’s scheduling of the reversal of existing temporary taxable differences.
We also evaluated the assumptions used by the Company to develop estimates of future taxable income by jurisdiction and tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data.
For example, we compared the estimates of future taxable income with the actual results of prior periods, as well as management’s consideration of other future market conditions.
We also assessed the accuracy of management’s historical estimates and compared the estimate of future taxable income with other forecasted financial information prepared by the Company.
/s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company's auditor since 2006.

74 Nielsen Holding plc Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies Nielsen Holdings plc (“Nielsen” or the “Company”), together with its subsidiaries, is a leading global information and measurement company that provides clients with a comprehensive understanding of consumers and consumer behavior.
Nielsen’s approach marries the Company’s proprietary data with other data sources to help clients around the world understand what's happening now, what's happening next, and how to best act on this knowledge.
For more than 90 years Nielsen has provided data and analytics based on scientific rigor and innovation, continually developing new ways to answer the most important questions facing the media, advertising, retail and fast-moving consumer goods industries.
Prior to February 2019, Nielsen was aligned into two reporting segments: what consumers buy (“Buy”) and what consumers read, watch and listen to (“Watch”).
In February 2019, Nielsen realigned its business segments from Buy and Watch to Nielsen Global Connect (“Connect”) and Nielsen Global Media (“Media”).
Each segment operates as a complete unit—from the conception of a product, through the collection of the data, into the technology and operations, all the way to the data being sold and delivered to the client.
These changes better align Nielsen’s external view to the Company’s go-forward internal view.
The Company’s reportable segments are stated on the new basis and such changes were retrospectively applied.
The impact of these changes had an insignificant impact on Nielsen’s condensed consolidated financial statements or segment results.
See Note 18- “Segments” for a discussion of the Company’s reportable segments.
Nielsen has a presence in more than 100 countries, with its registered office located in Oxford, the United Kingdom and headquarters located in New York, United States.
On August 31, 2015, Nielsen N.V., a Dutch public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, merged with Nielsen Holdings plc, by way of a cross-border merger under the European Cross-Border Merger Directive, with Nielsen Holdings plc being the surviving company (the “Merger”).
The Merger effectively changed the place of incorporation of Nielsen’s publically traded parent holding company from the Netherlands to England and Wales, with no changes made to the business being conducted by Nielsen prior to the Merger.
Due to the fact that the Merger was a business combination between entities under common control, the exchange of assets and liabilities were made at carrying value.
Therefore, there were no direct accounting implications in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
All amounts are presented in U.S.
Dollars (“$”), except for share and per share data or where expressly stated as being in other currencies, e.g., Euros (“€”).
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Nielsen and all subsidiaries and other controlled entities.
The Company has evaluated events occurring subsequent to December 31, 2019 for potential recognition or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements and concluded there were no subsequent events that required recognition or disclosure other than those provided.
Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Nielsen and all subsidiaries and other controlled entities.
Noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries are reported as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements with disclosure on the face of the consolidated statements of operations of the amounts of consolidated net income/(loss) attributable to Nielsen shareholders and to the noncontrolling interests.
The equity method of accounting is used for investments in affiliates and joint ventures where Nielsen has significant influence but not control, usually supported by a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
In addition, the Company records changes in the fair value of non-equity method equity investments with readily determinable fair values in net income rather than in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss).
Investments that do not have readily determinable fair values are recognized at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.
The adjustments related to the observable price changes will also be recognized in net income.
Intercompany accounts and transactions between consolidated companies have been eliminated in consolidation.
Foreign Currency Translation Nielsen has significant investments outside the U.S., primarily in the Euro-zone, Canada and the United Kingdom.
Therefore, changes in the value of foreign currencies affect the consolidated financial statements when translated into U.S.
Dollars.
The functional currency for substantially all subsidiaries outside the U.S. is the local currency.
Financial statements for these subsidiaries are translated into U.S.
Dollars at period-end exchange rates as to the assets and liabilities and monthly average exchange rates as to revenues, expenses and cash flows.
For these countries, currency translation adjustments are recognized in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), net, whereas transaction gains and losses are recognized in foreign exchange transaction losses, net in the consolidated statement of operations.
75 Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Research and Development Costs Research and development costs, which were not material for any periods presented, are expensed as incurred.
Deferred Costs Incremental direct costs incurred related to establishing or significantly expanding a panel in a designated market are deferred at the point when Nielsen determines them to be recoverable.
Prior to this point, these cost are expensed as incurred.
These deferred costs are typically amortized through cost of revenues over the original contract period beginning when the panel or infrastructure to service new clients is ready for its intended use.
Advertising and Marketing Costs Advertising and marketing costs are expensed as incurred and are reflected as selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
These costs include all brand advertising, telemarketing, direct mail and other sales promotion associated with marketing/media research services.
Advertising and marketing costs totaled $18 million, $18 million and $21 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Computation of Net Income per Share Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and dilutive potential shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Dilutive potential shares of common stock primarily consist of employee stock options and restricted stock.
Employee stock options, restricted stock and similar equity instruments granted by the Company are treated as potential common stock outstanding in computing diluted earnings per share.
Diluted stock outstanding includes nonvested restricted stock units and the dilutive effect of in-the-money options which is calculated based on the average share price for each period using the treasury stock method.
Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options, the amount of compensation cost for future service that the Company has not yet recognized are assumed to be used to repurchase stock.
The effect of 8,181,944, 8,519,133 and 4,351,564 shares of common stock equivalents under stock compensation plans were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as such shares would have been anti-dilutive.
Comprehensive Income/(Loss) Comprehensive income/(loss) is reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income/(loss) and consists of net income/(loss) and other gains and losses, net of tax, affecting equity that are excluded from net income/(loss).
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity date of three months or less.
Cash and cash equivalents are carried at fair value.
Accounts Receivable The Company extends non-interest bearing trade credit to its customers in the ordinary course of business.
To minimize credit risk, ongoing credit evaluations of client’s financial condition are performed.
An estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable or returns are expected.
76 During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company sold $360 million, $295 million and $202 million, respectively, of accounts receivables to third parties and recorded an immaterial loss on the sale to interest expense, net in the consolidated statement of operations.
As of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, $85 million, $105 million and $110 million, respectively, of previously sold receivables, remained outstanding.
The sales were accounted for as true sales, without recourse.
Nielsen maintains servicing responsibilities of the majority of the receivables sold during the year, for which the related costs are not significant.
The proceeds of $360 million, $295 million and $202 million from the sales were reported as a component of the changes in trade and other receivables, net within operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
Other Significant Accounting Policies The following table includes other significant accounting policies that are described in other notes to the financial statements, including the related note: Significant Accounting Policy Note Revenue recognition 3 Leases 5 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 6 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 6&8 Property, Plant and Equipment 8 Investments 9 Financial Instruments 9 Derivative Financial Instruments 9 Pensions and Other Post Retirement Benefits 11 Share-Based Compensation 14 Income Taxes 15 2.
Summary of Recent Accounting Pronouncements Leases Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new lease accounting standard using the transition method approved by the FASB on July 30, 2018, which allows companies to apply the provisions of the new leasing standard as of January 1, 2019, without adjusting the comparative periods presented.
In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard.
This allowed us to carry forward the historical lease classification.
Adoption of this standard resulted in the recording of net operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets of $0.5 billion (amount is net of lease incentives and ASC 420 cease-use liabilities) and corresponding operating lease liabilities of $0.6 billion.
Financial position for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 are presented under the new guidance, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with previous guidance.
See Note 5 (“Leases”) for further discussion.
Income taxes In February 2018, the FASB issued an ASU, “Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects From Accumulated Comprehensive Income”.
The new standard gives companies the option to reclassify stranded tax effects caused by the newly-enacted US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) from accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) to retained earnings.
The new standard became effective for Nielsen on January 1, 2019.
Nielsen elected to not reclassify stranded income tax effects of the TCJA from AOCI to retained earnings.
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses In June 2016, the FASB issued an ASU, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”.
The standard significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income.
The standard will replace today’s “incurred loss” approach with an “expected loss” model for instruments measured at amortized cost.
For available-for-sale debt securities, entities will be required to record allowances rather than reduce the carrying amount, as they do today under the other-than-temporary impairment model.
It also simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans.
The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.
Nielsen does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
77 Compensation-Retirement Benefits-Defined Benefit Plans-General In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No.
2018-14, Compensation—Retirement Benefits—Defined Benefit Plans—General (Subtopic 715-20), which amends the current disclosure requirements regarding defined benefit pensions and other post retirement plans, and allows for the removal of certain disclosures, while adding certain new disclosure requirements.
This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and allows for early adoption.
The Company does not expect this new standard to have a significant impact to our disclosures.
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income taxes In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No.
2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes which amends and aims to simplify accounting disclosure requirements regarding a number of topics including: intraperiod tax allocation, accounting for deferred taxes when there are changes in consolidation of certain investments, tax basis step up in an acquisition and the application of effective rate changes during interim periods, amongst other improvements.
This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and allows for early adoption.
Nielsen is assessing the impact of this new standard on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and its future disclosures.
3.
Revenue Recognition Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer.
The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a product or service to a customer, which generally occurs over time.
Substantially all of the Company’s customer contracts are non-cancelable and non-refundable.
The following is a description of principal activities, by reportable segment, from which the Company generates its revenues.
Revenue from the Connect segment consists primarily of measurement services, which include the Company’s core tracking and scan data (primarily transactional measurement data and consumer behavior information) to businesses in the consumer packaged goods industry.
Nielsen’s data is used by its clients to measure their market share, tracking billions of sales transactions per month in retail outlets around the world.
Revenues for these services are recognized over the period during which the performance obligations are satisfied as the customer receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company and control of the services are transferred to the customer.
The Company also provides consumer intelligence and analytical services that help clients make smarter business decisions throughout their product development and marketing cycles.
The Company’s performance under these arrangements do not create an asset with an alternative use to the company and generally include an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, as such, revenue for these services is typically recognized over time.
Revenue for contracts that do not include an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date is recognized at a point in time when the performance obligation is satisfied, generally upon delivery of the services, and when control of the service is transferred to the customer.
Revenue from Nielsen’s Media segment is primarily generated from television, radio, digital and mobile audience measurement services and analytics which are used by the Company’s media clients to establish the value of airtime and more effectively schedule and promote their programming and the Company’s advertising clients to plan and optimize their spending.
As the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company’s performance, revenues for these services are recognized over the period during which the performance obligations are satisfied and control of the service is transferred to the customer.
The Company enters into cooperation arrangements with certain customers, under which the customer provides Nielsen with its data in exchange for Nielsen’s services.
Nielsen records these transactions at fair value, which is determined based on the fair value of goods or services received, if reasonably estimable.
If not reasonably estimable, the Company considers the fair value of the goods or services surrendered.
78 The table below sets forth the Company’s revenue disaggregated within each segment by major product offerings and timing of revenue recognition.
(IN MILLIONS) Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Connect Segment Measure $ 2,161 $ 2,211 $ 2,233 Predict/Activate 896 927 1,045 Connect $ 3,057 $ 3,138 $ 3,278 Media Segment Audience Measurement $ 2,471 2,411 2,321 Plan/Optimize 970 966 973 
Media $ 3,441 $ 3,377 $ 3,294 Total $ 6,498 $ 6,515 $ 6,572 Timing of revenue recognition Products transferred at a point in time $ 576 $ 576 $ 495 Products and services transferred over time 5,922 5,939 6,077 Total $ 6,498 $ 6,515 $ 6,572 Contract Assets and Liabilities Contract assets represent the Company’s rights to consideration in exchange for services transferred to a customer that have not been billed as of the reporting date.
While the Company’s rights to consideration are generally unconditional at the time its performance obligations are satisfied, under certain circumstances the related billing occurs in arrears, generally within one month of the services being rendered.
At the inception of a contract, the Company generally expects the period between when it transfers its services to its customers and when the customer pays for such services will be one year or less.
Contract liabilities relate to advance consideration received or the right to consideration that is unconditional from customers for which revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied and control transferred to the customer.
The table below sets forth the Company’s contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers.
(IN MILLIONS) Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Contract assets $ 218 $ 210 Contract liabilities $ 346 $ 359 The increase in the contract assets balance during the period was primarily due to $203 million of revenue recognized that was not billed, in accordance with the terms of the contracts, as of December 31, 2019, offset by $193 million of contract assets included in the December 31, 2018 balance that were invoiced to Nielsen’s clients and therefore transferred to trade receivables.
The decrease in the contract liability balance during the period was primarily due to $326 million of advance consideration received or the right to consideration that is unconditional from customers for which revenue was not recognized during the period, offset by $337 million of revenue recognized during the period that had been included in the December 31, 2018 contract liability balance.
Transaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations As of December 31, 2019, approximately $5.9 billion of revenue is expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) for Nielsen’s services.
This amount excludes variable consideration allocated to performance obligations related to sales and usage based royalties on licenses of intellectual property.
79 The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately 82% of these remaining performance obligations through December 31, 2021, with the balance recognized thereafter.
Deferred Costs Incremental direct costs incurred to build the infrastructure to service new contracts are capitalized as a contract cost.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the balances of such capitalized costs were $11 million and $18 million, respectively.
These costs are typically amortized through cost of revenues over the original contract period beginning when the infrastructure to service new clients is ready for its intended use.
The amortization of these costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $8 million and $23 million, respectively.
There was no impairment loss recorded in any of the periods recorded.
4. Business Acquisitions and Dispositions Gracenote For the year ended December 31, 2019, Nielsen paid cash consideration of $61 million associated with current period acquisitions, net of cash acquired.
Had these 2019 acquisitions occurred as of January 1, 2019, the impact on Nielsen’s consolidated results of operations would not have been material.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, Nielsen paid cash consideration of $43 million associated with both current period and previously executed acquisitions, net of cash acquired.
Had these 2018 acquisitions occurred as of January 1, 2018, the impact on Nielsen’s consolidated results of operations would not have been material.
On February 1, 2017, Nielsen completed the acquisition of Gracenote Inc., Gracenote Canada, Inc., Gracenote Netherlands Holdings B.V., Tribune Digital Ventures, LLC, and Tribune International Holdco, LLC (each, a “Gracenote Company” and together “Gracenote”) through the purchase of 100% of Gracenote’s outstanding common stock for a total purchase price of $585 million.
Nielsen acquired the data and technology that underpins the programming guides and personnel user experience for major video, music, audio and sports content.
This acquisition expands Nielsen’s footprint with major clients including Gracenote’s global content database which spans across platforms including multichannel video programing distributors (MVPD’s), smart television, streaming music services, connected devices, media players and in-car infotainment systems.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, excluding Gracenote, Nielsen paid cash consideration of $210 million associated with both current period and previously executed acquisitions, net of cash acquired.
Had these 2017 acquisitions occurred as of January 1, 2017, the impact on Nielsen’s consolidated results of operations would not have been material.
There were no discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
5.
Leases All significant lease arrangements are generally recognized at lease commencement.
Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement.
An ROU asset and corresponding lease liability are not recorded for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less (short term leases) and Nielsen recognizes lease expense for these leases as incurred over the lease term.
ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset during the reasonably certain lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.
Nielsen’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that Nielsen will exercise that option.
Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.
Nielsen uses the rate implicit in the lease for the discount rate when determining the present value of lease payments whenever that rate is readily determinable.
If the rate is not readily determinable, Nielsen uses its incremental borrowing rate, which is updated periodically, based on the information available at commencement date.
The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments related to initial direct cost and prepayments and excludes lease incentives.
Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Nielsen has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for together.
Nielsen has operating and finance leases for real estate facilities, servers, computer hardware, and other equipment.
Nielsen’s leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 30 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 5 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within 1 year.
80 The components of lease expense were as follows: (in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2019 Lease cost Finance lease cost: Amortization of right-of-use assets $ 62 Interest on lease liabilities 9 Total finance lease cost 71 Operating lease cost 123 Short-term lease costs 5 Sublease income (3 ) Total lease cost $ 196 Nielsen recognized rental income received under subleases from operating leases of $3 million, $6 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
At December 31, 2019, Nielsen had aggregate future proceeds to be received under operating lease sub-lease guarantees of $8 million.
81 Supplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows: (in millions, except lease term and discount rate) December 31, 2019 Operating leases Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 393 Other current liabilities 110 Operating lease liabilities 370 Total operating lease liabilities $ 480 Finance leases Property, plant and equipment, gross $ 393 Accumulated depreciation (213 ) Property, plant and equipment, net 180 Other intangible assets, gross 24 Accumulated amortization (13 ) Other intangible assets, net 11 Accounts payable and other current liabilities 53 Long-term debt and finance lease obligations 92 Total finance lease liabilities $ 145 Other information Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities Operating cash flows used in finance leases (9 ) Operating cash flows used in operating leases (126 ) Financing cash flows used in finance leases (60 ) Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new finance lease liabilities 40 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities 43 Weighted-average remaining lease term--finance leases 4 years Weighted-average remaining lease term--operating leases 8 years Weighted-average discount rate--finance leases 6.2 % Weighted-average discount rate--operating leases 4.5 % Annual maturities of Nielsen’s lease liabilities are as follows: (in millions) Operating Leases Finance Leases 2020 $ 136 $ 61 2021 99 42 2022 75 29 2023 53 15 2024 40 7 Thereafter 171 8 Total lease payments 574 162 Less imputed interest (94 ) (17 ) Total $ 480 $ 145 82 6.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting of certain trade names and trademarks, are each tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable.
Nielsen has designated October 1st as the date in which the annual assessment is performed as this timing corresponds with the development of the Company’s formal budget and business plan review.
Nielsen reviews the recoverability of its goodwill by comparing the estimated fair values of reporting units with their respective carrying amounts.
The Company established, and continues to evaluate, its reporting units based on its internal reporting structure and defines such reporting units at its operating segment level or one level below.
The estimates of fair value of a reporting unit are determined using a combination of valuation techniques, primarily an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis supplemented by a market-based approach.
A discounted cash flow analysis requires the use of various assumptions, including expectations of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and tax rates in developing the present value of future cash flow projections.
The market-based approach utilizes available market comparisons such as indicative industry multiples that are applied to current year revenue and earnings as well as recent comparable transactions.
Nielsen conducted the annual assessment as of October 1, 2019 and concluded that there was no impairment.
Prior to the annual assessment date, in connection with Nielsen’s ongoing strategic review, Nielsen considered various alternatives for the Company including the potential sale of the Connect business.
During this process, there were indications that the fair value of the Connect reporting unit was lower than the carrying value.
Nielsen considered this as well as other factors to be interim indicators of impairment and determined that it was more likely than not that the Connect reporting unit was impaired.
Management performed an impairment analysis of Connect as of September 30, 2019.
As a result of this analysis, Nielsen concluded that the fair value was less than the carrying value and recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $1,004 million for the Connect reporting unit.
The primary inputs for determining the estimated fair value were inputs from the strategic review process, market values for comparable entities and updated intrinsic values.
During the first quarter of 2019, Nielsen updated its reporting structure in a manner that changed the composition of the Company’s reporting units.
The result of this change was combining two of Nielsen’s reporting units into one.
Both of these reporting units were in the former Watch reportable segment.
The current reporting units are Media and Connect (formerly Watch and Buy), which is the same as Nielsen’s reportable segments.
As a result of this change in reporting units, Nielsen performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis during the first quarter immediately prior to the change and after the change, and determined that the estimated fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values (including goodwill).
As such, there was no impairment as a result of this change.
Goodwill is stated at historical cost less accumulated impairments losses, if any.
The table below summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
(IN MILLIONS) Connect Media Total Balance, December 31, 2017 $ 2,844 $ 5,651 $ 8,495 Acquisitions, divestitures and other adjustments 11 15 26 Impairment (1,411 ) — (1,411 ) Effect of foreign currency translation (107 ) (16 ) (123 ) Balance, December 31, 2018 $ 1,337 $ 5,650 $ 6,987 Acquisitions, divestitures and other adjustments 8 12 20 Impairment (1,004 ) — (1,004 ) Effect of foreign currency translation (10 ) — (10 ) Balance, December 31, 2019 $ 331 $ 5,662 $ 5,993 Cumulative impairments $ 2,415 $ 376 $ 2,791 At December 31, 2019, $45 million of goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
83 Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets with finite lives are stated at historical cost, less accumulated amortization and impairment losses.
These intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives, which are reviewed annually.
Nielsen has purchased and internally developed software to facilitate its global information processing, financial reporting and client access needs.
Costs that are related to the conceptual formulation and design of software programs are expensed as incurred.
Costs that are incurred to produce the finished product after technological feasibility has been established are capitalized as an intangible asset and are amortized over the estimated useful life.
If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of software may not be recovered, a recoverability analysis is performed based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the software in the future.
If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from the future cash flows, the software cost is written down to estimated fair value and an impairment is recognized.
These estimates are subject to revision as market conditions and as the Company’s assessments change.
At December 31, 2019, the net book value of purchased and internally developed software was $36 million and $1,330 million, respectively.
Certain of the trade names associated with Nielsen are deemed indefinite-lived intangible assets, as their associated Nielsen brand awareness and recognition has existed for over 50 years and the Company intends to continue to utilize these trade names.
There are also no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that may limit their estimated useful lives.
Nielsen reconsiders the remaining estimated useful life of indefinite-lived intangible assets each reporting period.
The impairment test for other indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount.
If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
The estimates of fair value of trade names and trademarks are determined using a “relief from royalty” discounted cash flow valuation methodology.
Significant assumptions inherent in this methodology include estimates of royalty rates and discount rates.
Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the respective intangible assets.
Assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which comparable trade names and trademarks are being licensed in the marketplace.
There was no impairment noted in any period presented with respect to the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets.
As of the October 1, 2019 assessment, one of Nielsen’s indefinite-lived intangible assets had a fair value that exceeded its carrying value by less than 10%.
Nielsen is required to assess whether the value of the Company’s amortizable intangible assets have been impaired whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable.
Nielsen does not perform a periodic assessment of assets for impairment in the absence of such information or indicators.
Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable.
Recoverability of assets that are held and used is measured by comparing the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be derived from an asset (or a group of assets) to their carrying value.
If the carrying value of the asset (or the group of assets) exceeds the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows, impairment is considered to exist.
If impairment is considered to exist based on undiscounted cash flows, the impairment charge is measured using an estimation of the assets’ fair value, typically using a discounted cash flow method.
The identification of impairment indicators, the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of fair values for assets (or groups of assets) requires Nielsen to make significant judgments concerning the identification and validation of impairment indicators, expected cash flows and applicable discount rates.
These estimates are subject to revision as market conditions and the Company’s assessments change.
The Company’s impairment assessments resulted in the recognition of a non-cash self-developed software asset impairment charge of $2 million during the fourth quarter of 2018.
There was no impairment or indicators of impairment noted in 2019 with respect to the Company’s amortizable intangible assets.

Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives.
Nielsen is required to assess whether the value of our long-lived assets, including the Company’s buildings, improvements, technical and other equipment have been impaired whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable.
Nielsen does not perform a periodic assessment of assets for impairment in the absence of such information or indicators.
Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable.
Recoverability of assets that are held and used is measured by comparing the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be derived from an asset (or a group of assets) to their carrying value.
If the carrying value of the asset (or the group of assets) exceeds the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows, impairment is considered to exist.
If impairment is considered to exist based on undiscounted cash flows, the impairment charge is measured using an estimation of the assets’ fair value, typically using a discounted cash flow method.
The identification of impairment indicators, the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of fair values for assets (or groups of assets) requires Nielsen to make significant judgments concerning the identification and validation of impairment indicators, expected cash flows and applicable discount rates.
These estimates are subject to revision as market conditions and our assessments change.
There was no impairment or indicators of impairment noted in any period presented with respect to the Company’s finite long-lived assets.
The following tables summarizes the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment including the associated useful lives: Estimated December 31, December 31, (IN MILLIONS) Useful Life 2019 2018 Land and buildings 25-50 years $ 383 $ 378 Information and communication equipment 3-10 years 1,108 1,014 Furniture, equipment and other 3-10 years 103 109 1,594 1,501 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization (1,128 ) (1,033 ) $ 466 $ 468 Depreciation and amortization expense from operations related to property, plant and equipment was $158 million, $169 million and $171 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The above amounts include amortization expense on assets under finance leases and other financing obligations of $62 million, $49 million and $47 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Finance leases and other financing obligations are comprised primarily of land and buildings and information and communication equipment.
See Note 5 “Leases” for further information on finance leases.
9.
Fair Value Measurements Nielsen’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, investments, long-term debt and derivative financial instruments.
These financial instruments potentially subject Nielsen to concentrations of credit risk.
To minimize the risk of credit loss, these financial instruments are primarily held with acknowledged financial institutions.
The carrying value of Nielsen’s financial instruments approximate fair value, except for differences with respect to long-term, fixed and variable-rate debt.
The fair value of financial instruments is generally determined by reference to market values resulting from trading on a national securities exchange or in an over-the-counter market.
In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques.
Cash equivalents have original maturities of three months or less.
In addition, the Company has accounts receivable that are not collateralized.
The Connect and Media segments service high quality clients dispersed across many geographic areas.
The Company analyzes the aging of accounts receivable, historical bad debts, customer creditworthiness and current economic trends in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts.
Investments include investments in affiliates and a trading asset portfolio maintained to generate returns to offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements.
Nielsen assesses declines in the value of individual investments to determine whether such decline is other than temporary and thus the investment is impaired by considering available evidence.
No impairment charge was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
87 Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
When determining fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact, and also considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of non-performance.
There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1: Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level 2: Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.
Level 3: Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable and may not be corroborated by market data.
Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Recurring Basis The Company’s financial assets and liabilities are measured and recorded at fair value, except for equity method investments and long-term debt.
Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements.
The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their placement within the fair value hierarchy.
In addition, the Company records changes in the fair value of equity investments with readily determinable fair values in net income rather than in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss).
Investments that do not have readily determinable fair values are recognized at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.
The adjustments related to the observable price changes will also be recognized in net income.
The following table summarizes the valuation of the Company’s material financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2019 and 2018: December 31, (IN MILLIONS) 2019 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets: Plan assets for deferred compensation (1) $ 26 $ 26 $ — $ — Investment in mutual funds (2) 2 2 — — Interest rate swap arrangements (3) — — — — Total $ 28 $ 28 $ — $ — Liabilities: Interest rate swap arrangements (3) $ 22 $ — $ 22 $ — Deferred compensation liabilities (4) 26 26 — — Total $ 48 $ 26 $ 22 $ — December 31, 2018 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets: Plan assets for deferred compensation (1) $ 25 $ 25 $

These investments are carried at fair value, which is based on quoted market prices at period end in active markets.
These investments are classified as equity securities with any gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recorded in other income/(expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations.
88 (2) Investments in mutual funds are money-market accounts held with the intention of funding certain specific retirement plans.
(3) Derivative financial instruments include interest rate swap arrangements recorded at fair value based on externally-developed valuation models that use readily observable market parameters and the consideration of counterparty risk.
(4) The Company offers certain employees the opportunity to participate in a deferred compensation plan.
A participant’s deferrals are invested in a variety of participant directed stock and bond mutual funds and are classified as equity securities.
Changes in the fair value of these securities are measured using quoted prices in active markets based on the market price per unit multiplied by the number of units held exclusive of any transaction costs.
A corresponding adjustment for changes in fair value of the equity securities is also reflected in the changes in fair value of the deferred compensation obligation.
Derivative Financial Instruments Nielsen primarily uses interest rate swap derivative instruments to manage the risk that changes in interest rates will affect the cash flows of its underlying debt obligations.
To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship must meet several conditions with respect to documentation, probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement.
Nielsen documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions as well as the hedge effectiveness assessment, both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis.
Nielsen recognizes all derivatives at fair value either as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and changes in the fair values of such instruments are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
If specific cash flow hedge accounting criteria are met, Nielsen recognizes the changes in fair value of these instruments in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss).
Nielsen manages exposure to possible defaults on derivative financial instruments by monitoring the concentration of risk that Nielsen has with any individual bank and through the use of minimum credit quality standards for all counterparties.
Nielsen does not require collateral or other security in relation to derivative financial instruments.
A derivative contract entered into between Nielsen or certain of its subsidiaries and a counterparty that was also a lender under Nielsen’s senior secured credit facilities at the time the derivative contract was entered into is guaranteed under the senior secured credit facilities by Nielsen and certain of its subsidiaries (see Note 12 – (“Long-term Debt and Other Financing Arrangements”) for more information).
Since it is Nielsen’s policy to only enter into derivative contracts with banks of internationally acknowledged standing, Nielsen considers the counterparty risk to be remote.
It is Nielsen’s policy to have an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) Master Agreement established with every bank with which it has entered into any derivative contract.
Under each of these ISDA Master Agreements, Nielsen agrees to settle only the net amount of the combined market values of all derivative contracts outstanding with any one counterparty should that counterparty default.
Certain of the ISDA Master Agreements contain cross-default provisions where if the Company either defaults in payment obligations under its credit facility or if such obligations are accelerated by the lenders, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations.
At December 31, 2019, Nielsen had no material exposure to potential economic losses due to counterparty credit default risk or cross-default risk on its derivative financial instruments.
Interest Rate Risk Nielsen is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on the floating-rate U.S. Dollar and Euro Term Loans, and uses floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps to hedge this exposure.
For these derivatives, Nielsen reports the after-tax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) and reclassifies it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, and within the same income statement line item as the impact of the hedged transaction.
In May 2019, the Company entered into a $150 million aggregate notional amount four-year forward interest rate swap agreement with a starting date of July 9, 2019.
This agreement fixes the LIBOR-related portion of interest rates of a corresponding amount of the Company’s variable-rate-debt at an average rate of 1.82%.
This derivative has been designated as an interest rate cash flow hedge.
89 In March 2019, the Company entered into a $150 million aggregate notional amount four-year forward interest rate swap agreement with a starting date of April 9, 2019.
This agreement fixes the LIBOR-related portion of interest rates of a corresponding amount of the Company’s variable-rate-debt at an average rate of 2.26%.
This derivative has been designated as an interest rate cash flow hedge.
In March 2019, the Company entered into a $250 million aggregate notional amount four-year forward interest rate swap agreement with a starting date of June 9, 2019.
This agreement fixes the LIBOR-related portion of interest rates of a corresponding amount of the Company’s variable-rate-debt at an average rate of 2.07%.

Restructuring Activities Productivity Initiatives Restructuring charges are primarily related to programs associated with Nielsen’s plans to reduce selling, general and administrative expenses, consolidate operating centers, as well as automation initiatives.
These charges primarily relate to employee separation packages.
The amounts are calculated based on salary levels and past service periods.
Severance costs are generally charged to earnings when planned employee terminations are approved.
A summary of the changes in the liabilities for restructuring activities is provided below: Total (IN MILLIONS) Initiatives Balance at December 31, 2016 $ 73 Charges 80 Non cash charges and other adjustments 2 Payments (97 ) Balance at December 31, 2017 58 Charges 139 Non cash charges and other adjustments (2 ) Payments (127 ) Balance at December 31, 2018 68 Reclassification of ASC 420 real estate restructuring to right-of -use asset (1) (22 ) Charges (2) 62 Payments (74 ) Non cash charges and other adjustments 1 Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 35 (1) Upon adoption of ASC 842, the real estate operating lease ASC 420 liabilities were reclassified and presented as a reduction of the related operating lease right-of-use asset.

Pensions and Other Post-Retirement Benefits Nielsen sponsors both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans (the “Pension Plans”) and post-retirement medical plans for some if its employees in the Netherlands, the U.S. and other international locations.
Pension costs, in respect of defined benefit pension plans, primarily represent the increase in the actuarial present value of the obligation for pension benefits based on employee service during the year and the interest on this obligation in respect of employee service in previous years, net of the expected return on plan assets.
Differences between this expected return and the actual return on these plan assets and actuarial changes are not recognized in the statement of operations, unless the accumulated differences and changes exceed a certain threshold.
Nielsen recognizes obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans as expenses in the statement of operations as they are incurred.
The determination of benefit obligations and expenses is based on actuarial models.
In order to measure benefit costs and obligations using these models, critical assumptions are made with regard to the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets and the assumed rate of compensation increases.
Nielsen provides retiree medical benefits to a limited number of participants in the U.S.
Therefore, retiree medical care cost trend rates are not a significant driver of our post retirement costs.
Management reviews these critical assumptions at least annually.
Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as turnover, retirement and mortality rates.
Management reviews these assumptions periodically and updates them as necessary.
The discount rate is the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled.
For Nielsen’s U.S. plans, the discount rate is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency.
For the Dutch and other non-U.S. plans, the discount rate is set by reference to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds.
Nielsen believes the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds in these portfolios are expected to match the estimated payment benefit streams of our plans.
The Company uses the spot rate approach to calculate the discount rate for its retirement benefit plans.
Under the spot-rate approach, the Company uses individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments in order to calculate interest cost and service cost within net periodic benefit costs.
To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, Nielsen considers, for each country, the structure of the asset portfolio and the expected rates of return for each of the components.
For Nielsen’s U.S. plans, a 50 basis point decrease in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense on our principal plans by approximately $1 million per year.
A similar 50 basis point decrease in the expected return on assets for the Company’s principal Dutch plan would also increase pension expense by approximately $1 million per year.
The Company assumed that the weighted-averages of long-term returns on our pension plans were 4.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019, 4.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The expected long-term rate of return is applied to the fair value of pension plan assets.
The actual return on plan assets will vary year to year from this assumption.
Although the actual return on plan assets will vary from year to year, it is appropriate to use long-term expected forecasts in selecting Nielsen’s expected return on plan assets.
As such, there can be no assurance that the Company’s actual return on plan assets will approximate the long-term expected forecasts.
During 2019, certain of the Company’s pension plans contracted with insurance companies and transferred $632 million of outstanding defined benefit pension obligations and related pension assets for approximately 6,000 retirees and beneficiaries in the Netherlands and UK to the insurance companies.
The insurance companies are now required to pay and administer the retirement benefits owed to these retirees and beneficiaries.
These transactions have no impact on the amount, timing, or form of the monthly retirement benefit payments to the covered retirees and beneficiaries.
These transactions resulted in a non-cash charge to other income/expense of $170 million in our consolidated statements of operations and did not impact cash flows in 2019.

The historical returns on these asset classes were weighted based on the expected long-term allocation of the assets of the Pension Plans.
Nielsen’s pension plans’ weighted average asset allocations by asset category are as follows: The United Netherlands States Other Total At December 31, 2019 Equity securities 39 % 54 % 50 % 51 % Fixed income securities 53 45 39 43 Other 8 1 11 6 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % At December 31, 2018 Equity securities 21 % 52 % 41 % 33 % Fixed income securities 62 47 28 50 Other 17 1 31 17 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % No Nielsen shares are held by the Pension Plans.
Nielsen’s primary objective with regard to the investment of the Pension Plans’ assets is to ensure that in each individual plan, sufficient funds are available to satisfy future benefit obligations.
For this purpose, asset and liability management studies are made periodically at each pension fund.
For each of the Pension Plans, an appropriate mix is determined on the basis of the outcome of these studies, taking into account the national rules and regulations.
The overall target asset allocation among all plans for 2019 was 49% equity securities and 45% long-term interest-earning investments (debt or fixed income securities), and 6% other investments.
Equity securities primarily include investments in U.S. and non U.S. companies.
Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries and mortgage-backed securities.
Insurance contracts are categorized as level 3 and are valued based on contractual terms.

These assets are initially valued at cost and are reviewed periodically utilizing available and relevant market data to determine if the carrying value of these assets should be adjusted.
The valuation methodology is applied consistently from period to period.
Other types of investments categorized as Level 3 are primarily insurance contracts and are valued based on contractual terms.
Contributions to the Pension Plans in 2020 are expected to be approximately zero for the Netherlands plan, $11 million for the U.S. plan and $17 million for other plans.

The Company believes that it is probable that it will be able to refinance this debt prior to maturity.
Senior Secured Credit Facilities Term Loan Facilities In June 2018, Nielsen entered into an Amendment Agreement to amend and restate its Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Prior Credit Agreement”) in the form of the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Amended Credit Agreement”).
Among other things, the Amendment Agreement provided for: (i) the refinancing and replacement of the prior Tranche A Revolving Credit Facility with a new Tranche A Revolving Credit Facility having commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $850,000,000; (ii) the refinancing and replacement of the prior Class A Term Loans with new Class A Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of $1,125,000,000; (iii) the refinancing and replacement of the prior Class B-2 Euro Term Loans with new Class B-2 Euro Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of € 545,245,518; and (iv) incurring incremental term loans in the form of Class B-4 Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of $75,000,000.
The proceeds of loans under each replacement facility were used to replace or refinance the entire outstanding principal amount of loans under the prior facility that was replaced, and the proceeds of the incremental Class B-4 Term Loans, together with a portion of the proceeds of the Class B-2 Euro Term Loans in excess of the amount of the prior Class B-2 Euro Term Loans that were replaced, were used to prepay the amount of prior Class A Term Loans in excess of the amount of new Class A Term Loans.
The new Class A Term Loans will mature in full on July 9, 2023 and are required to be repaid in quarterly installments in an aggregate amount equal to 0.63% of the original principal amount of the Class A Term Loans for each of the first eight quarters following the effective date of the Amendment Agreement, 1.25% of the original principal amount of the Class A Term Loans for each of the subsequent eight quarters and 2.50% of the original principal amount of the Class A Term Loans for each of the subsequent three quarters, with the balance payable on July 9, 2023.
The new Class B-2 Euro Term Loans will mature in full on October 4, 2023 and are required to be repaid in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate amount equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Class B-2 Euro Term Loans, with the balance payable on October 4, 2023.
The Class B-4 Term Loans will mature in full on October 4, 2023 and are required to be repaid in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate amount equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Class B-4 Term Loans, with the balance payable on October 4, 2023.
The new Tranche A Revolving Credit Facility matures on July 9, 2023.
The new Class A Term Loans and loans under the new Tranche A Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our election, (i) a base rate or eurocurrency rate, plus (ii) an applicable margin determined by reference to the Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), which varies from 0.25% to 1.00%, in the case of base rate loans, and from 1.25% to 2.00%, in the case of eurocurrency rate loans.
The Class B-2 Euro Term Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) a eurocurrency rate plus (ii) an applicable margin equal to 2.50%.
The Class B-4 Term Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our election, (i) a base rate or eurocurrency rate, plus (ii) an applicable margin, which is equal to 2.00%, in the case of eurocurrency loans, or 1.00%, in the case of base rate loans.
The Amended Credit Agreement contains substantially the same affirmative and negative covenants as those of the Prior Credit Agreement, except the exceptions to the restrictions on restricted payments and investments that are determined by reference to the Total Leverage Ratio were amended to increase the applicable limits.
Nielsen wrote-off certain previously capitalized deferred financing fees of $2 million associated with the June 2018 debt refinancing and incurred certain costs in connection with the refinancing of $5 million.
Obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are guaranteed by TNC B.V., substantially all of the wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries of TNC B.V. and certain of the non-U.S. wholly-owned subsidiaries of TNC B.V., and are secured by substantially all of the existing and future property and assets of the U.S. subsidiaries of TNC B.V. and by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of the guarantors, the capital stock of substantially all of the U.S. subsidiaries of TNC B.V., and up to 65% of the capital stock of certain of the non-U.S. subsidiaries of TNC B.V.
Under a separate security agreement, substantially all of the assets of TNC B.V. are pledged as collateral for amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement.
102 Covenants The Amended Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of Nielsen Holding and Finance B.V. and its restricted subsidiaries (which together constitute most of Nielsen’s subsidiaries) to incur additional indebtedness or guarantees, incur liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions, make certain loans and investments, declare dividends, make payments or redeem or repurchase capital stock, engage in certain mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations, prepay, redeem or purchase certain indebtedness, amend or otherwise alter terms of certain indebtedness, sell certain assets, transact with affiliates, enter into agreements limiting subsidiary distributions and alter the business they conduct.
These entities are restricted, subject to certain exceptions, in their ability to transfer their net assets to us.
Such restricted net assets amounted to approximately $2.1 billion at December 31, 2019.
In addition, these entities are subject to a total leverage covenant.
The leverage ratio requires that Nielsen not permit the ratio of total net debt (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) at the end of any calendar quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) for the four quarters then ended to exceed a specified threshold.
The maximum permitted ratio is 5.50 to 1.00.
Neither Nielsen nor TNC B.V. is currently bound by any financial or negative covenants contained in the Amended Credit Agreement.
The Amended Credit Agreement also contains certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default.
Certain significant financial covenants are described further below.
Failure to comply with this financial covenant would result in an event of default under Nielsen’s Amended Credit Agreement unless waived by certain of Nielsen’s term lenders and the Company’s revolving lenders.
An event of default under Nielsen’s Amended Credit Agreement can result in the acceleration of Nielsen’s indebtedness under the facilities, which in turn would result in an event of default and possible acceleration of indebtedness under the agreements governing Nielsen’s debt securities as well.
As Nielsen’s failure to comply with the financial covenant described above can cause the Company to go into default under the agreements governing Nielsen’s indebtedness, management believes that Nielsen’s Amended Credit Agreement and this covenant are material to Nielsen.
As of December 31, 2019, Nielsen was in full compliance with the financial covenant described above.
Pursuant to Nielsen’s Amended Credit Agreement, the Company is subject to making mandatory prepayments on the term loans within Nielsen’s Amended Credit Agreement to the extent in any full calendar year Nielsen generate Excess Cash Flow (“ECF”), as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement.
The percentage of ECF that must be applied as a repayment is a function of several factors, including Nielsen’s ratio of total net debt to Covenant EBITDA, as well other adjustments, including any voluntary term loan repayments made in the course of the calendar year.
To the extent any mandatory repayment is required pursuant to this ECF clause; such payment must generally occur on or around the time of the delivery of the annual consolidated financial statements to the lenders.
At December 31, 2019, Nielsen’s ratio of total net debt to Covenant EBITDA was less than 5.00 to 1.00 and therefore no mandatory repayment was required.
Nielsen’s next ECF measurement date will occur upon completion of the 2020 results, and although Nielsen do not expect to be required to issue any mandatory repayments in 2020 or beyond, it is uncertain at this time if any such payments will be required in future periods.
Revolving Credit Facility The Amended Credit Agreement contains a senior secured revolving credit facility under which Nielsen Finance LLC, TNC (US) Holdings, Inc., and Nielsen Holding and Finance B.V. can borrow revolving loans.
The revolving credit facility can also be used for letters of credit, guarantees and swingline loans.
The existing revolving credit facility has commitments of $850 million with a final maturity of July 2023.
The senior secured revolving credit facility is provided under the Amended Credit Agreement and so contains covenants and restrictions as noted under the “Term loan facilities” section above.
Obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by the same entities that guarantee obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement and Senior Secured Loan Agreement.
As of December 31, 2019, Nielsen had zero borrowings outstanding and outstanding letters of credit of $17 million.
As of December 31, 2018, Nielsen had zero borrowings outstanding and outstanding letters of credit of $16 million.
As of December 31, 2019, Nielsen had $833 million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility.
103 Debenture Loans The indentures governing the Senior Notes limit the majority of Nielsen’s subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase its capital stock, make certain investments, enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, use assets as security in other transactions and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies subject to certain exceptions.
Upon a change in control, Nielsen is required to make an offer to redeem all of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to the 101% of the aggregate accreted principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.
The Senior Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by Nielsen, substantially all of the wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries of Nielsen, and certain of the non-U.S. wholly-owned subsidiaries of Nielsen.
Other Transactions Effective July 1, 2010, the Company designated its Euro denominated variable rate senior secured term loans as non-derivative hedges of its net investment in a European subsidiary.
Gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in the Euro as compared to the U.S. Dollar associated with this debenture were recorded to the cumulative translation adjustment within shareholders’ equity, net of income tax.
Debt-Issuance Costs The costs related to the issuance of debt are presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability and amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the related debt.
Finance Lease and Other Obligations Nielsen finances certain computer equipment, software, buildings and automobiles under finance leases and related transactions.
These arrangements do not include terms of renewal, purchase options, or escalation clauses.
Assets under finance lease are recorded within property, plant and equipment.
See Note 8 “Property, Plant and Equipment.” Liabilities under finance leases are recorded within long-term debt and other financing obligations above.
See Note 5 “Leases” for more information on finance leases and other financing obligations referenced in this note.

The dividend policy and the payment of future cash dividends are subject to the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors.
Nielsen’s Board approved a share repurchase program, as included in the below table, for up to $2 billion in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock.

Share-based Compensation Nielsen measures the cost of all share-based payments, including stock options, at fair value on the grant date and recognizes such costs within the consolidated statements of operations; however, no expense is recognized for share-based payments that do not ultimately vest.
Nielsen recognizes the expense of its options that cliff vest using the straight-line method.
For those that vest over time, an accelerated graded vesting is used.
The Company recorded $50 million, $35 million and $45 million of expense associated with share-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The tax benefit related to the share-based compensation expense was $6 million, $5 million and $13 million for each of the respective periods.
105 Nielsen has an equity-based, management compensation plan (“Equity Participation Plan” or “EPP”) to align compensation for certain key executives with the performance of the Company.
Under this plan, certain of the Company’s executives may be granted stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and dividend equivalent rights in the shares of the Company or purchase its shares.
In connection with the completion of Nielsen’s initial public offering of common stock on January 31, 2011 (and further amended), the Company implemented the Nielsen 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Prior Plan”) and suspended further grants under the EPP.
In 2019, the Company replaced the Nielsen 2010 Stock Incentive Plan with the Nielsen 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Stock Incentive Plan”).
The Stock Incentive Plan is the source of new equity-based awards permitting the Company to grant to its key employees, directors and other service providers the following types of awards: incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other awards valued in whole or in part by reference to shares of Nielsen’s common stock and performance-based awards denominated in shares or cash.
Under the Stock Incentive Plan, Nielsen granted zero, 750,000 and 1,000 time-based stock options to purchase shares during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
As of December 31, 2019, the total number of shares authorized for award of options or other equity-based awards was 10,420,826 under the Stock Incentive Plan.
This includes the 7,200,000 newly authorized shares under the Stock Incentive Plan and the 3,220,826 shares reserved for issuance from the Prior Plan.
The 2018 time-based awards become exercisable over a three year vesting period at a rate of 33.3% per year on the anniversary date of the award, and are tied to the executives’ continuing employment.
The 2017 time-based awards become exercisable over a four-year vesting period at a rate of 6.25% per quarter, and are tied to the executives’ continuing employment.
The fair values of the granted time-based awards granted during 2018 and 2017 were estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the expected volatility based on the Company’s historical volatility.
The following assumptions were used for the grants of time-based awards during 2019, 2018 and 2017: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Expected life (years) — 6.00 4.50 Risk-free interest rate — 2.87 % 2.02 % Expected dividend yield — 4.97 % 3.76 % Expected volatility — 25.96 % 22.01 % Weighted average volatility — 25.96 % 22.01 % 106 Nielsen’s stock option plan activity is summarized below: Number of Options(Time Based) Weighted-AverageExercise Price Weighted-AverageRemainingContractualTerm inYears AggregateIntrinsicValue inMillions Stock Option Plan activity Outstanding at December 31, 2016 8,158,168 $ 40.19 4.43 $ 43 Granted 1,000 36.17 Forfeited (996,015 ) 47.59 Exercised (1,293,850 ) 28.13 Outstanding at December 31, 2017 5,869,303 $ 41.58 3.52 $ 13 Granted 750,000 40.00 Forfeited (988,826 ) 46.08 Expired options (153,799 ) 30.47 Exercised (844,842 ) 28.04 Outstanding at December 31, 2018 4,631,836 $ 43.20 3.66 $ — Granted — — Forfeited (662,732 ) 46.31 Expired options (445,760 ) 28.09 Exercised (9,027 ) 17.44 Outstanding at December 31, 2019 3,514,317 $ 44.60 3.15 $ — Exercisable at December 31, 2019 2,817,876 $ 44.77 2.61 $ — During the year ended December 31, 2019, there were no options granted and the aggregate fair value of options vested was $5 million.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the weighted-average grant date fair value of the options granted was $2.16 and $4.70, respectively, and the aggregate fair value of options vested was $6 million and $9 million, respectively.
At December 31, 2019, there was approximately $1 million of unearned share-based compensation related to stock options (net of estimated forfeitures) which the Company expects to record as share-based compensation expense over the next two years.
The compensation expense related to the time-based awards is amortized over the term of the award using the graded vesting method.
The intrinsic value of the options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2019 was insignificant.
The intrinsic value of the options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $6 million and $17 million, respectively.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash proceeds from the exercise of options was insignificant.
Under the Nielsen 2010 Stock Incentive Plan, Nielsen granted 2,524,176 time and performance based stock options to purchase shares during the year ended December 31, 2018.
The weighted average grant date fair value of the awards was $3.09.
The performance aspect of the award is achieved based on the performance of Nielsen’s stock price.
If the performance obligations are satisfied, the award will become exercisable over a three year vesting period at a rate of 33.3% per year on the anniversary date of the award, and are tied to the executives’ continuing employment.
As of December 31, 2019, there was approximately $1 million of unearned share-based compensation related to performance stock options (net of estimated forfeitures) which the Company expects to record as share-based compensation over the next two years.
During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2017, there were no time and performance based stock options issued.
The fair values of the granted time and performance based awards during 2018 were estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model with the expected volatility based on the Company’s historical volatility.
107 The following assumptions were used for grants of time and performance based awards during 2018: Year Ended December 31, 2018 Expected life (years) 5.00 Risk-free interest rate 2.83-2.92 % Expected dividend yield 4.85- 5.54 % Expected volatility 27.11-27.27 % Weighted average volatility 27.13 % Activity of Nielsen’s restricted stock units (RSUs) that are ultimately payable in shares of common stock granted under the Stock Incentive Plan is summarized below: Number of RSUs Weighted-AverageGrant Date Fair Value RSU activity Nonvested at December 31, 2016 1,356,393 $ 47.69 Granted 1,574,973 36.23 Forfeited (339,292 ) 46.09 Vested (503,086 ) 44.62 Nonvested at December 31, 2017 2,088,988 $ 40.36 Granted 2,780,914 25.35 Forfeited (361,821 ) 38.46 Vested (642,397 ) 41.24 Nonvested at December 31, 2018 3,865,684 $ 29.88 Granted 2,454,871 21.46 Forfeited (692,718 ) 28.63 Vested (986,852 ) 33.60 Nonvested at December 31, 2019 4,640,985 $ 25.10 With the exception of a limited group of senior executives, the 2019 and 2018 awards will vest at a rate of 6.25% per quarter over four years.
The 2019 awards for the limited group of senior executives will vest at one of the following rates: 25% on the first anniversary date of the award/75% on the second anniversary date of the award, 100% on the second anniversary date of the award, 12.5% per quarter over two years, or 25% per year over four years on the anniversary date of the award.
The 2018 awards for the limited group of senior executives will vest at one of the following rates: 100% on the third anniversary date of the award, 100% on the second anniversary date of the award, 33.3% per year over three years on the anniversary date of the award, 12.5% per quarter over two years, or 25% per year over four years on the anniversary date of the award.
The 2017 awards for the limited group of senior executives will vest at a rate of 25% per year over four years on the anniversary date of the award.
On January 31, 2017, Nielsen completed the acquisition of Gracenote and concurrently provided 31,381 replacement restricted stock units under Nielsen’s existing 2010 Stock Incentive Plan.
The exchange was accounted for as a modification in accordance with ASC 718.
The aggregate fair value of the replacement awards granted on January 31, 2017 was $2 million, of which $1 million was attributed to post merger service and $1 million was included in purchase price consideration.
As of December 31, 2019, there was approximately $51 million of unearned share-based compensation related to unvested RSUs (net of estimated forfeitures) which the Company expects to record as stock-based compensation expense over a weighted average period of 2.8 years.
108 During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company granted 523,508, 463,442 and 348,885 performance restricted stock units, respectively, representing the target number of performance restricted stock subject to the award.
The weighted average grant date fair value of the awards in 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $24.62, $27.94 and $37.88 per share.
For the performance restricted stock units granted in 2019, the total number of performance restricted stock units to be earned is subject to achievement of cumulative performance goals for the three year period ending December 31, 2021.
For the performance restricted stock units granted in 2018, the total number of performance restricted stock units to be earned is subject to achievement of cumulative performance goals for the three year period ending December 31, 2020.
For the performance restricted stock units granted in 2017, the total number of performance restricted stock units to be earned is subject to achievement of cumulative performance goals for the three year period ending December 31, 2019.
For the 2019 award, fifty percent of the target award will be determined based on the Company’s revenue compounded annual growth rate achievements and fifty percent of the award will be determined based on adjusted earnings per share achievements.
There is a relative total shareholder return modifier that can increase or decrease the payout.
For the 2018 award, twenty five percent of the target award will be determined based on the Company’s revenue compounded annual growth rate achievements, twenty five percent of the target award will be based on the Company’s relative total shareholder return and fifty percent of the award will be determined based on free cash flow achievements.
For the 2017 awards, forty percent of the target award will be determined based on the Company’s relative total shareholder return and sixty percent of the target award will be determined based on free cash flow achievements.
The maximum payout is 200% of target.
The fair value of the target award related to free cash flow was the fair value on the date of the grant, and the fair value of the target awards related to relative shareholder return was based on the Monte Carlo model.
As of December 31, 2019, there is approximately $6 million of unearned share-based compensation related to unvested performance restricted stock units (net of estimated forfeitures).
The compensation expense is amortized over the term of the award, which is 3 years after the grant date.

Income Taxes Nielsen provides for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
If it is determined that it is more likely than not that future tax benefits associated with a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is provided.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as an adjustment to income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Such tax positions are, based solely on their technical merits, more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities and reflect the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law and significantly changed the way the U.S. taxes corporations.
The TCJA reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and created a territorial-style taxing system.
The TCJA required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred and also created new taxes on certain types of foreign earnings.
As of December 31, 2017, we made a reasonable estimate of the (a) effects on our existing deferred tax balances, and (b) the one-time transition tax.
Consequently, our fourth quarter of 2017 and full year 2017 results of operations reflected a non-cash provisional net expense of $104 million.
We finalized our accounting for the TCJA in December of 2018 and our results for the fourth quarter of 2018 and full year 2018 results of operations reflect, in accordance with SAB 118, a reduction in tax expense of $252 million as an adjustment to the 2017 provisional expense.
This was primarily comprised of a net tax benefit of $57 million relating to finalizing the calculation of the transition tax (including withholding taxes) together with a net tax benefit of $195 million associated with the re-measurement of our deferred taxes.
The TCJA imposed a U.S. tax on global intangible low taxed income (“GILTI”) that is earned by certain foreign affiliates owned by a U.S. shareholder and was intended to tax earnings of a foreign corporation that are deemed to be in excess of certain threshold return.
As of December 31, 2018, Nielsen made a policy decision and elected to treat taxes on GILTI as a current period expense and have reflected as such within the financial statements as of December 31, 2019 as well.
109 As part of an intercompany restructuring during the year ended December 31, 2018, we transferred certain intellectual property assets between wholly-owned legal entities in non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
As the impact of the transfer was the result of an intra-entity transaction, the resulting gain on the transfer was eliminated for purposes of the consolidated financial statements.
The transferring entity recognized a gain on the transfer of assets that was not subject to income tax in its local jurisdiction.
In accordance with ASU 2016-16, which the Company adopted in the first quarter of 2018, and as further described in Note 1.
“Significant Accounting Policies”, Nielsen recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $193 million.
Throughout 2019, ongoing federal and international audits were effectively settled in certain tax jurisdictions and the impact was recorded accordingly the financial statements.
The components of income/(loss) before income taxes and equity in net income of affiliates, were: Year Ended December 31, (IN MILLIONS) 2019 2018 2017 UK $ (30 ) $ 3 $ 27 Non-UK (633 ) (885 ) 801 Income/(loss) before income taxes and equity in net income/(loss) of affiliates $ (663 ) $ (882 ) $ 828 The above amounts for UK and non-UK activities were determined based on the location of the taxing authorities.
The provision for income taxes attributable to the income/(loss) before income taxes and equity in net income/(loss) of affiliates consisted of: Year Ended December 31, (IN MILLIONS) 2019 2018 2017 Current: UK $ — $ — $ — Non-UK .

111 The components of current and non-current deferred income tax assets/(liabilities) were: (IN MILLIONS) December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Deferred tax assets (on balance): Net operating loss carryforwards $ 484 $ 532 Capital loss carryforwards 50 3 Interest expense limitation 349 301 Employee benefits 59 59 Tax credit carryforwards 186 205 Share-based payments 12 15 Accrued expenses 39 41 Other assets 30 66 Financial instruments 1 — 1,210 1,222 Valuation allowances (636 ) (651 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances 574 571 Deferred tax liabilities (on balance): Intangible assets (892 ) (913 ) Fixed asset and computer software depreciation (273 ) (241 ) Financial instruments — (6 ) Unremitted earnings (57 ) (61 ) Unrealized gain on investments (49 ) (49 ) Deferred (revenues)/costs (5 ) (9 ) Other liabilities (74 ) (67 ) (1,350 ) (1,346 ) Net deferred tax liability $ (776 ) $ (775 ) Realization of deferred tax assets is based, in part, on Nielsen’s judgment and various factors including reversal of deferred tax liabilities, Nielsen’s ability to generate future taxable income in jurisdictions where such assets have arisen and potential tax planning strategies.
Valuation allowances are recorded in order to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized in the future.
At December 31, 2019 and 2018 the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2,066 million and $2,208 million, respectively, which began to expire in 2020.
In addition, the Company had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $186 million and $205 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which began to expire in 2020.
In certain jurisdictions, the Company has operating losses and other tax attributes that, due to the uncertainty of achieving sufficient profits to utilize these operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards, the Company currently believes it is more likely than not that a portion of these losses will not be realized.
Therefore, the Company had a valuation allowance of approximately $636 million and $651 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax assets related to other temporary differences.
With respect to the outside basis differences of “domestic” subsidiaries, in each taxing jurisdiction where a tiered ownership structure exists, the Company has confirmed that one or more viable tax planning strategies exists in each separate taxing jurisdiction that it could, and would - if required - employ to eliminate any income tax liability on such outside basis differences.
In addition, resulting from TCJA, the company no longer asserts that all foreign undistributed earnings will be permanently reinvested, but rather the company will, over time, remit up foreign earnings and has provisioned for withholding taxes related to those earnings.
At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had gross uncertain tax positions of $164 million and $572 million, respectively.
The Company has also accrued interest and penalties associated with these unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 of $25 million and $70 million, respectively.
Estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes is classified as a component of benefit (provision) for income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months certain tax examinations will close, which could result in a change in unrecognized tax benefits, along with related interest and penalties.
Furthermore, the amounts ultimately paid may differ from the amounts accrued.
An estimate of any possible change cannot be made at this time.
112 A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross uncertain tax positions is as follows: (IN MILLIONS) December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Balance as of the beginning of period $ 572 $ 452 $ 432 Additions for current year tax positions 2 21 11 Additions for tax positions of prior years 14 108 15 Reductions for lapses of statute of limitations (424 ) (8 ) (2 ) Reductions for tax positions of prior years — (1 ) (4 ) Balance as of the end of the period $ 164 $ 572 $ 452 Throughout 2019, ongoing federal and international audits were effectively settled in certain tax jurisdictions and the impact was recorded accordingly the financial statements.
If the balance of the Company’s uncertain tax positions is sustained by the taxing authorities in the Company’s favor, the reversal of the entire balance would reduce the Company’s effective tax rate in future periods.
The Company files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions.
With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. Federal income tax examinations for 2015 and prior periods.
In addition, the Company has subsidiaries in various states, provinces and countries that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2007 through 2018.
16.
Investments in Affiliates and Related Party Transactions Related Party Transactions with Affiliates As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, Nielsen had investments in affiliates of $17 million and $16 million, respectively.
Obligations between Nielsen and its affiliates are regularly settled in cash in the ordinary course of business.
Nielsen had net receivables from its affiliates of approximately $2 million and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
17.
Commitments and Contingencies Leases and Other Contractual Arrangements In July 2019, the Company amended its Second Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement (the “MSA”), dated as of October 1, 2017 and effective as of January 1, 2017 (the “Effective Date”), with Tata America International Corporation and Tata Consultancy Services Limited (jointly, “TCS”) by executing Amendment Number One (the “Amendment”) with TCS, dated as of July 1, 2019 and effective as of January 1, 2019 (the “Amendment Effective Date”).
The Amendment reduces the amount of services Nielsen has committed to purchase from TCS from the Amendment Effective Date through the remaining term of the MSA (the “Minimum Commitment”) to $1.413 billion, including a commitment to purchase at least $275 million in services during 2019, at least $250 million in services during 2020, $184.3 million in services per year from 2021 through 2024, and $137.8 million in services in 2025 (in each of the foregoing cases, the “Annual Commitment”).
TCS’s charges under existing and future statements of work (“SOW”) pursuant to the MSA will continue to be credited against the Minimum Commitment and the Annual Commitment and the occurrence of certain events, some of which also provide Nielsen with the right to terminate the Agreement or SOWs, as applicable, will continue to be available to reduce the Minimum and Annual Commitment Amounts as they occur.
The parties also agreed to certain other commercial terms.
However, the other material terms of the MSA as reflected in the MSA and as previously disclosed remain unchanged.
As of December 31, 2019, the remaining TCS commitment was approximately $1.1 billion.
Nielsen has also entered into operating leases and other contractual obligations to secure real estate facilities, agreements to purchase data processing services and leases of computers and other equipment used in the ordinary course of business and various outsourcing contracts.
These agreements are not unilaterally cancelable by Nielsen, are legally enforceable and specify fixed or minimum amounts or quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices.
113 The amounts presented below represent the minimum annual payments under Nielsen’s purchase obligations that have initial or remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year.
These purchase obligations include data processing, building maintenance, equipment purchasing, photocopiers, land and mobile telephone service, computer software and hardware maintenance, and outsourcing.
For the Years Ending December 31, (IN MILLIONS) 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Thereafter Total Operating leases $ 136 $ 99 $ 75 $ 53 $ 40 $ 171 $ 574 Other contractual obligations(a) 627 295 203 190 185 139 1,639 Total $ 763 $ 394 $ 278 $ 243 $ 225 $ 310 $ 2,213 (a) Other contractual obligations represent obligations under agreement, which are not unilaterally cancelable by Nielsen, are legally enforceable and specify fixed or minimum amounts or quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices.
Nielsen generally requires purchase orders for vendor and third party spending.
The amounts presented above represent the minimum future annual services covered by purchase obligations including data processing, building maintenance, equipment purchasing, photocopiers, land and mobile telephone service, computer software and hardware maintenance, and outsourcing.
Nielsen’s remaining commitments as of December 31, 2019, under the outsourced services agreement with TCS have been included above based on the Annual Commitment minimum required payments.
Total expenses incurred under operating leases were $123 million, $96 million and $96 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Nielsen recognized rental income received under subleases of $3 million, $6 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
At December 31, 2019, Nielsen had aggregate future proceeds to be received under sub-lease guarantees of $8 million.
Nielsen also has minimum commitments under non-cancelable finance leases.
See Note 5 “Leases” for more information on finance leases.
Guarantees and Other Contingent Commitments At December 31, 2019, Nielsen was committed under the following significant guarantee arrangements: Sub-lease guarantees Nielsen provides sub-lease guarantees in accordance with certain agreements pursuant to which Nielsen guarantees all rental payments upon default of rental payment by the sub-lessee.
To date, the Company has not been required to perform under such arrangements, does not anticipate making any significant payments related to such guarantees and, accordingly, no amounts have been recorded.
Letters of credit Letters of credit issued and outstanding amount to $17 million and $16 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Legal Proceedings and Contingencies In August 2018, a putative shareholder class action lawsuit was filed in the Southern District of New York, naming as defendants Nielsen, former Chief Executive Officer Dwight Mitchell Barns, and former Chief Financial Officer Jamere Jackson.
Another lawsuit, which alleged similar facts but also named other Nielsen officers, was filed in the Northern District of Illinois in September 2018 and transferred to the Southern District of New York in December 2018.
The actions were consolidated on April 22, 2019, and the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi was appointed lead plaintiff for the putative class.
The operative complaint was filed on September 27, 2019, and asserts violations of certain provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, based on allegedly false and materially misleading statements relating to the outlook of Nielsen’s Buy (now “Connect”) segment, the Company’s preparedness for changes in global data privacy laws and Nielsen’s reliance on third-party data.
The Company moved to dismiss the operative complaint on November 26, 2019.
Briefing of the Company’s motion is scheduled to conclude on February 26, 2020.
In addition, in January 2019, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in New York Supreme Court against a number of Nielsen’s current and former officers and directors.
The derivative lawsuit alleges that the named officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties to Nielsen in connection with factual assertions substantially similar to those in the putative class action complaints.
The derivative lawsuit further alleges that certain officers and directors engaged in trading Nielsen stock based on material, nonpublic information.
By agreement dated June 26, 2019, the derivative lawsuit has been stayed pending resolution of the Company’s motion to dismiss the aforementioned securities litigation.
Nielsen intends to defend these lawsuits vigorously.
Based on currently available information, Nielsen believes that the Company has meritorious defenses to these actions and that their resolution is not likely to have a material adverse effect on Nielsen’s business, financial position, or results of operations.
114 Nielsen is also subject to litigation and other claims in the ordinary course of business, some of which include claims for substantial sums.
Accruals have been recorded when the outcome is probable and can be reasonably estimated.
While the ultimate results of claims and litigation cannot be determined, the Company does expect that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its operations or financial condition.
However, depending on the amount and the timing, an unfavorable resolution of some or all of these matters could materially affect the Company’s future results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.
18.
Segments The Company aligns its operating segments in order to conform to management’s internal reporting structure, which is reflective of service offerings by industry.
Prior to February 2019, Management aggregated such operating segments into two reporting segments: what consumers buy (“Buy”), consisting principally of market research information and analytical services; and what consumers read, watch and listen to (“Watch”), consisting principally of television, radio, online and mobile audience and advertising measurement and corresponding analytics.
In February 2019, Nielsen realigned its business segments from Buy and Watch to Nielsen Global Connect (“Connect”) and Nielsen Global Media (“Media”).
Each segment operates as a complete unit—from the conception of a product, through the collection of the data, into the technology and operations, all the way to the data being sold and delivered to the client.
These changes better align Nielsen’s external view to its go-forward internal view.
The Company’s reportable segments are stated on the new basis and such changes were retrospectively applied.
The impact of these changes did not have a material impact on Nielsen’s consolidated financial statements or segment results.
Corporate consists principally of unallocated items such as certain facilities and infrastructure costs as well as intersegment eliminations.
Certain corporate costs, other than those described above, including those related to selling, finance, legal, human resources, and information technology systems, are considered operating costs and are allocated to the Company’s segments based on either the actual amount of costs incurred or on a basis consistent with the operations of the underlying segment.
Information with respect to the operations of each of Nielsen’s business segments is set forth below based on the nature of the services offered and geographic areas of operations.

Guarantor Financial Information The following supplemental financial information is being provided for purposes of compliance with reporting covenants contained in certain debt obligations of Nielsen and its subsidiaries.
The financial information sets forth for Nielsen, its subsidiaries that have issued certain debt securities (the “Issuers”) and its guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries, the consolidating balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and consolidating statements of operations and cash flows for the periods ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
The issued debt securities are jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by Nielsen and subject to certain exceptions, each of the direct and indirect 100% owned subsidiaries of Nielsen, in each case to the extent that such entities provide a guarantee under the senior secured credit facilities.
The issuers are also 100% owned indirect subsidiaries of Nielsen: Nielsen Finance LLC and Nielsen Finance Co. for certain series of debt obligations, and The Nielsen Company (Luxembourg) S.ar.l., for the other series of debt obligations.
Each issuer is a guarantor of the debt obligations not issued by it.
Nielsen is a holding company and does not have any material assets or operations other than ownership of the capital stock of its direct and indirect subsidiaries.
All of Nielsen’s operations are conducted through its subsidiaries, and, therefore, Nielsen is expected to continue to be dependent upon the cash flows of its subsidiaries to meet its obligations.
The senior secured credit facilities contain certain limitations on the ability of Nielsen to receive the cash flows of its subsidiaries.
While all subsidiary guarantees of the issued debt securities are full and unconditional, these guarantees contain customary release provisions including when (i) the subsidiary is sold or sells all of its assets, (ii) the subsidiary is declared “unrestricted” for covenant purposes, (iii) the subsidiary’s guarantee under the senior secured credit facilities is released and (iv) the requirements for discharge of the indenture have been satisfied.
