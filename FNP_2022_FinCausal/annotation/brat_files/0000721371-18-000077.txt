MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
The discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.Business OverviewNewell Rubbermaid is a global marketer of consumer and commercial products that help people flourish every day, where they live, learn, work and play.
The Company’s products are marketed under a strong portfolio of leading brands, including Rubbermaid®, Levolor®, Goody®, Calphalon®, Sharpie®, Paper Mate®, Parker®, Waterman®, Irwin®, Lenox®, Graco®, Aprica® and Dymo®.
On January 1, 2012, the Company, as part of Project Renewal, implemented changes to its organizational structure that resulted in the consolidation of the Company’s three operating groups into two and the consolidation of its 13 global business units (“GBUs”) into nine.
One of the two operating groups was consumer-facing (“Newell Consumer”), while the other was commercial-facing (“Newell Professional”).
In addition, while not an operating group, the Baby & Parenting GBU was treated as a stand-alone operating segment.In October 2012, the Company committed to an expansion of Project Renewal, designed to further simplify and align the business around two key activities – Brand & Category Development and Market Execution & Delivery.
As part of the expanded program, the Company’s Consumer and Professional groups were eliminated and the Company’s nine GBUs were streamlined into six business segments.
The six business segments and the key brands included in each of the six business segments are as follows:•Home Solutions: Rubbermaid®, Calphalon®, Levolor®, Kirsch® and Goody® •Writing: Sharpie®, Paper Mate®, Expo®, Prismacolor®, Parker® and Waterman® •Tools: Irwin® and Lenox® tools and Dymo® Industrial •Commercial Products: Rubbermaid Commercial Products® and Rubbermaid® Healthcare•Baby & Parenting: Graco®, Aprica® and Teutonia® •Specialty: Bulldog®, Ashland™, Shur-Line®, Dymo® Office, Endicia® and Mimio® The actions taken by the Company in 2012 are intended to simplify the organization and free up resources to invest in growth initiatives and strengthened capabilities.
These changes are considered key enablers to building a bigger, faster-growing, more global and more profitable Newell Rubbermaid.
Business StrategyNewell Rubbermaid’s vision is to become a global company of Brands That Matter™ and great people, known for best-in-class results.
The Company is committed to building consumer-meaningful brands through understanding the needs of consumers and using those insights to create innovative, highly differentiated product solutions that offer superior performance and value.
The transformation that began several years ago building Brands That Matter™ and insight-driven innovations that win in the marketplace has created a solid foundation.
The Company now has a stronger and more tightly focused portfolio of leading brands with a margin structure that allows for brand investment.
The Company has devised its new Growth Game Plan, which is the strategy the Company is implementing to fulfill its ambition to build a bigger, faster-growing, more global and more profitable company.
The Growth Game Plan encompasses the following aspects:Business Model◦A brand-led business with a strong home in the United States and global ambition.◦Consumer brands that win at the point of decision through excellence in performance, design and innovation.◦Professional brands that win the loyalty of the chooser by improving the productivity and performance of the user.◦Collaboration with our partners across the total enterprise in a shared commitment to growth and creating value.◦Delivering competitive returns to shareholders through consistent, sustainable and profitable growth.21Table of ContentsWhere To Play◦Win Bigger — Deploying resources to businesses and regions with higher growth opportunities through investments in innovation and geographic expansion.◦Win Where We Are — Optimizing the performance of businesses and brands in existing markets by investing in innovation to increase market share and reducing structural spend within the existing geographic footprint.◦Incubate For Growth — Investing in businesses that have unique opportunities for growth, with a primary focus on businesses that are in the early stages of the business cycle.5 Ways To Win◦Make The Brands Really Matter — Sharpening brand strategies on the highest impact growth levers and partnering to win with customers and suppliers.◦Build An Execution Powerhouse — Realigning the customer development organization and developing joint business plans for new channel penetration and broader distribution.◦Unlock Trapped Capacity For Growth — Delivering savings from ongoing restructuring projects, working capital reductions and simplification of business processes.◦Develop The Team For Growth — Driving a performance culture aligned to the business strategy and building a more global perspective and talent base.◦Extend Beyond Our Borders — Accelerating investments and growth in emerging markets.During 2012, the Company executed against the delivery phase of the Growth Game Plan.
In this phase, the Company implemented structural changes in the organization while ensuring consistent execution and delivery.
The Company expects 2013 to be a transition year from the delivery phase to the strategic phase.
In the strategic phase, the Company expects to expand investment behind its Win Bigger businesses to drive accelerated growth.
In 2013, the Company will continue implementing changes to drive the Growth Game Plan into action.
These changes are the foundation of the expansion of Project Renewal and are organized into the following five workstreams:◦Organizational Simplification: The Company has de-layered its top structure by eliminating the two groups (Newell Consumer and Newell Professional) and further consolidating its businesses from nine GBUs to six business segments.◦EMEA Simplification: The Company will focus its resources on fewer products and countries, while simplifying go-to-market, delivery and back office support structures.◦Best Cost Finance: The Company will deliver a simplified approach to decision support, transaction processing and information management by leveraging SAP and the streamlined business segments to align resources with the Growth Game Plan.
◦Best Cost Back Office: The Company will drive “One Newell Rubbermaid” efficiencies in customer and consumer services and sourcing functions.
◦Supply Chain Footprint: The Company will further optimize manufacturing and distribution facilities across its global supply chain.
In implementing the tenets of its strategy and its change agenda, the Company is focused on Every Day Great Execution, or EDGE, to capitalize on and maximize the benefits of investment and growth opportunities and to optimize the cost structure of the business.
22Table of ContentsOrganizational StructureThe Company’s segments reflect the Company’s focus on building large consumer and professional brands and leveraging its understanding of similar markets and distribution channels.The Company’s six segments and the key brands included in each of the six business segments are as follows:Segment Key Brands Description of Primary ProductsHome Solutions Rubbermaid®, Calphalon® Levolor®, Goody® Indoor/outdoor organization, food storage and home storage products; gourmet cookware, bakeware, cutlery and small kitchen electrics; drapery hardware and window treatments; hair care accessoriesWriting Sharpie®, Paper Mate®, Expo®, Parker®, Waterman® Writing instruments, including markers and highlighters, pens and pencils; art products; fine writing instrumentsTools Irwin®, Lenox®, Dymo® Industrial Hand tools and power tool accessories; industrial bandsaw blades; cutting tools for pipes and HVAC systems; label makers and printers for industrial useCommercial Products Rubbermaid®CommercialProducts, Rubbermaid® Healthcare Cleaning and refuse products, hygiene systems, material handling solutions; medical and computer carts, and wall-mounted workstationsBaby & Parenting Graco®, Aprica® Infant and juvenile products such as car seats, strollers, highchairs and playardsSpecialty Bulldog®, Shur-line®, Dymo®, Endicia®, Mimio® Convenience and window hardware; manual paint applicators; office technology solutions such as label makers and printers, on-line postage and interactive teaching solutionsMarket and Performance OverviewThe Company operates in the consumer and commercial products markets, which are generally impacted by overall economic conditions in the regions in which the Company operates.
The Company’s results in 2012 were impacted by the following factors: •Core sales, which exclude foreign currency, increased 2.2% in 2012 compared to the same period last year.
New products, geographic expansion and core sales growth in emerging markets were the primary drivers of the core sales growth, with double- and high-single-digit core sales growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific, respectively.
Deteriorating macroeconomic conditions in Western Europe and lower merchandising in Europe in advance of the SAP go-live adversely impacted core sales and were the primary drivers of a 4.7% core sales decline in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region.
Core sales is determined by applying the prior year monthly exchange rates to the current year local currency monthly sales amounts, with the difference in core sales and prior year reported sales representing core sales increases or decreases.
•Core sales increased 9.8% in the Baby & Parenting segment, with improved retail-level sales in North America and sustained momentum in the Asia Pacific region primarily due to new product launches.
Core sales grew 7.0% in the Tools segment with approximately half of the growth attributable to the segment’s international businesses.
Core sales increased 3.2% in the Writing segment driven by the continued global rollout of Paper Mate® InkJoy® and a strong back-to-school season.
The Home Solutions segment realized a core sales decline of 3.6%, primarily due to continued operational challenges in the Décor business (Levolor window treatments) within the Home Solutions segment and challenges in the Culinary and Décor businesses related to a change in merchandising strategy at a significant retail customer.
•Input and sourced product cost inflation was more than offset by pricing and productivity, which resulted in a 20 basis point improvement in gross margin compared to 2011.
The Company’s gross margin increased despite continued operational challenges in the Décor business within the Home Solutions segment and pressures due to uncertain macroeconomic conditions in Western Europe.•Continued focused spend for strategic SG&A activities to drive sales, enhance the new product pipeline, develop growth platforms and expand geographically.
During 2012, the Company’s spend for strategic brand-building and consumer demand creation and commercialization activities included spend for the following:•Continued investments to support the global roll out of Paper Mate®’s InkJoy® line of writing instruments, which feature innovative ultra-low viscosity ink for a smooth writing experience;23Table of Contents•Supported the Express Yourself with Sharpie® music campaigns, including the partnership with the musical group One Direction, to inspire Sharpie users to boldly express themselves in creative and innovative ways; •Continued expansion of dedicated Parker® “shop-in-shop” retail outlets in China and other regions to enhance in-store merchandising;•Expanded the launch of the Parker® Ingenuity Collection featuring Parker 5th™ Technology into Japan and China in the first half of 2012;•Continued support for “Irwinization” marketing and merchandising initiatives, including the Irwin National Tradesmen Day, “Blue wall” and other merchandising vehicles that get the Irwin® brand and new innovations in front of contractors in a more effective way;•Launched Irwin® 2500 Series Level featuring a robust new frame design that enables guaranteed vial accuracy for the life of the product;•Expanded the sales forces in the Tools, Writing and Commercial Products segments to drive greater sales penetration, enhance the availability of products and to support geographic expansion;•Supported new innovations in the Baby & Parenting segment, including the Graco® Fast-Action and Ready2Grow™ travel systems, which are driving significant market share gains; and•Supported the launch of the Rubbermaid® Clean & Dry Plunger with NeverWet™ nanotech coating, which forms a shield that repels water, Rubbermaid® Bathroom Scrubbers with four tools to choose from, and Rubbermaid® LunchBlox™ – a collection of customizable, modular food storage containers that snap together to save space and stay organized in lunch bags.•Continued the execution of Project Renewal to simplify the business, reduce structural costs and increase investment in the most significant growth platforms within the business.•Completed the implementation of the European Transformation Plan, which includes projects designed to improve the financial performance of the European business and centralize decision-making in the Geneva headquarters, and successfully went live with SAP in Europe in April 2012.•Improved the Company’s capital structure by completing the offering and sale of $500.0 million unsecured senior notes, consisting of $250.0 million principal amount of 2.0% notes due 2015 and $250.0 million principal amount of 4.0% notes due 2022, the aggregate proceeds of which were used in July 2012 to redeem the $436.7 million of outstanding 5.25% junior convertible subordinated debentures due December 2027, underlying the Company’s 5.25% convertible preferred securities.•Completed the offering and sale of $350.0 million 2.05% unsecured senior notes due 2017 and used the proceeds together with cash on hand and short-term borrowings to repay the $500.0 million principal amount of the 5.50% senior notes due April 2013 (the “2013 Notes”), for which interest expense was previously recorded at a rate of approximately 3.5% after contemplating the effects of the interest rate swaps related to the 2013 Notes.•Retired $250.0 million principal amount of the 6.75% medium-term notes due 2012 (the “2012 Notes”) upon maturity, for which interest expense was previously recorded at a rate of approximately 2.3% after contemplating the effect of the terminated interest rate swaps related to the 2012 Notes.
•Continued the $300.0 million three-year share repurchase plan that expires in August 2014, pursuant to which the Company repurchased and retired an additional 4.9 million shares of common stock for $91.5 million during 2012.•Increased the Company’s quarterly dividend by 88% during 2012, from $0.08 per share in the first quarter to $0.15 per share in the fourth quarter.24Table of ContentsKey InitiativesProject RenewalIn October 2011, the Company launched Project Renewal, a program designed to reduce complexity in the organization and increase investment in the most significant growth platforms within the business, funded by a reduction in structural selling, general & administrative (”SG&A”) costs.
The consolidation of a limited number of manufacturing facilities and distribution centers was also initiated as part of the program, with the goal of increasing operational efficiency, reducing costs, and improving gross margin.
In October 2012, the Company committed to an expansion of Project Renewal, designed to further simplify and align the business around two key activities — Brand & Category Development and Market Execution & Delivery.
As expanded, Project Renewal encompasses projects centered around five workstreams, as follows:•Organizational Simplification: The Company has de-layered its top structure by eliminating the two groups (Newell Consumer and Newell Professional) and further consolidated its businesses from nine GBUs to six business segments.•EMEA Simplification: The Company will focus its resources on fewer products and countries, while simplifying go-to-market, delivery and back office support structures.•Best Cost Finance: The Company will deliver a simplified approach to decision support, transaction processing and information management by leveraging SAP and the streamlined business segments to align resources with the Growth Game Plan.•Best Cost Back Office: The Company will achieve “One Newell Rubbermaid” efficiencies in customer and consumer services and sourcing functions.•Supply Chain Footprint: The Company will further optimize manufacturing and distribution facilities across its global supply chain.
The following table depicts estimated pre-tax restructuring and restructuring-related costs, annualized savings, and headcount impacts associated with Project Renewal (dollars in millions): Total Costs(1) Cash Costs Annualized Savings Approx.
Headcount ImpactsProject Renewal (October 2011)$90 to $100 $75 to $90 $90 to $100 500Renewal Expansion (October 2012)$250 to $275 $225 to $250(2) $180 to $225 1,750Project Renewal$340 to $375 $300 to $340 $270 to $325 2,250(1)Restructuring and restructuring-related charges of $69 million and $10 million, respectively, have been incurred through December 31, 2012, the majority of which were employee-related cash costs, including severance, retirement, and other termination benefits and costs.
Restructuring-related charges represent incremental cost of products sold and SG&A expenses associated with the implementation of Project Renewal.
(2)Consists of approximately 80% employee-related cash costs including severance, retirement, and other termination benefits and costs.Project Renewal in total is expected to be fully implemented by mid-2015, with annualized savings of $90 to $100 million expected by the first half of 2013.
The majority of the savings from Project Renewal will be invested in the business to unlock accelerated growth and to strengthen brand building and selling capabilities in priority markets around the world.Since the inception of Project Renewal through December 31, 2012, the Company has reduced structural overhead and consolidated three operating groups into two and 13 GBUs into nine, which resulted in a headcount reduction of approximately 175 employees.
In 2012, the Company completed the closure of the Home Solutions segment's Greenville, Texas, manufacturing facility, aiming to consolidate operations of the facility into the Company's existing facilities in Kansas and Ohio.
The Company also began implementing a distribution center consolidation in the Home Solutions segment as well as a project to align the Home Solutions segment's sales and marketing organizations with the Company's newly created Customer Development Organization.
In the Tools and the Commercial Products segments, the Company began reorganizing its sales and marketing functions and began a project to centralize Commercial Products' distribution operations.
In the Specialty segment, the Company began a project to close one of its U.S. manufacturing facilities in Lowell, Indiana.
In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company's Consumer and Professional groups were eliminated and the Company's nine GBUs were streamlined into six business segments.European Transformation PlanIn June 2010, the Company announced a program to centralize its European business (the “European Transformation Plan”).
The European Transformation Plan includes initiatives designed to transform the European organizational structure and processes to centralize certain operating activities, improve performance, leverage the benefits of scale and to facilitate a more efficient and cost-effective implementation of SAP, an enterprise resource planning system, in Europe, all with the aim of increasing operating margin in the European region to approximately 10%.
As of December 31, 2012, the Company had completed the implementation of its European Transformation Plan initiative with cumulative restructuring and restructuring-related costs of $38 million and $77 million, respectively.
The European Transformation Plan was expected to result in the realization of annual after-tax savings 25Table of Contentsof $55 to $65 million, and substantially all of these savings have been realized and were included in the Company’s 2011 and 2012 operating results.
In April 2012, the Company migrated its enterprise resource planning systems in Europe to SAP and began operating in a centralized European business model.
Since the Company reports sales and operating income based on the region from which the products are shipped and invoiced to external customers and the new model defines how certain regions import and export products, the new model impacted the regions in which the Company’s sales and operating income are reported in 2012.
Compared to prior periods, the new model generally results in the European region’s sales and operating income being lower with corresponding increases in the Company’s other regions.One Newell RubbermaidThe Company strives to leverage the common business activities and best practices of its segments, and to build one common culture of shared values with a focus on collaboration and teamwork.
Through this initiative, the Company has established regional shared service centers to leverage nonmarket-facing functional capabilities to reduce costs.
In addition, through the expansion of Project Renewal, the Company will expand its focus on leveraging the common business activities and best practices by enhancing its newly created Customer Development Organization and by reorganizing the business around two of the critical elements of the Growth Game Plan — Brand & Category Development and Market Execution & Delivery.The Company is also migrating multiple legacy systems and users to a common SAP global information platform in a phased, multi-year rollout.
SAP is expected to enable the Company to integrate and manage its worldwide business and reporting processes more efficiently.
Through December 31, 2012, the North American and European operations of substantially all of the Company’s six segments have successfully gone live with their SAP implementation efforts.The Company continues to evaluate and optimize nonstrategic SG&A expenditures throughout the organization, including centralizing indirect procurement to better leverage the Company's spend.CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe Company believes the selected data and the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the Consolidated Statements of Operations are important in evaluating the Company’s operations.
The following table sets forth items from the Consolidated Statements of Operations as reported and as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): 2012 2011 2010Net sales$5,902.7 100.0 % $5,864.6 100.0 % $5,658.2 100.0 %Cost of products sold3,673.6 62.2 3,659.4 62.4 3,509.5 62.0Gross margin2,229.1 37.8 2,205.2 37.6 2,148.7 38.0Selling, general and administrative expenses1,521.1 25.8 1,515.3 25.8 1,447.8 25.6Impairment charges— — 382.6 6.5 — —Restructuring costs56.1 1.0 50.1 0.9 77.4 1.4Operating income651.9 11.0 257.2 4.4 623.5 11.0Nonoperating expenses:

The following table sets forth an analysis of changes in consolidated net sales for 2012 as compared to 2011 (in millions, except percentages):Core sales$129.2 2.2 %Foreign currency(91.1) (1.6)Total change in net sales$38.1 0.6 %Core sales increased 2.2% compared to the prior year, driven by double-digit core sales growth in the Latin America region and high-single-digit core sales growth in the Asia Pacific region.
The growth in emerging markets was partially offset by a decline in the Company’s European businesses due to a challenging macroeconomic environment.
Excluding foreign currency, sales in North America and international businesses increased 1.8% and 3.3%, respectively, versus the prior year.
Foreign currency had the impact of reducing net sales by 1.6%.Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, for 2012 was 37.8%, or $2,229.1 million, versus 37.6% of net sales, or $2,205.2 million, for 2011.
The primary drivers of the 20 basis point gross margin increase were pricing and productivity, partially offset by input cost inflation.SG&A expenses for 2012 were 25.8% of net sales, or $1,521.1 million, versus 25.8% of net sales, or $1,515.3 million, for 2011.
In constant currency, SG&A expenses increased $32.6 million, primarily due to $37.1 million of incremental investments in brand building and strategic SG&A activities to support new products, marketing initiatives, new market entries and global expansion, and a $7.3 million increase in structural SG&A due to increased annual incentive compensation offset by savings from structural cost savings initiatives and ongoing restructuring projects.
Restructuring-related costs associated with the European Transformation Plan decreased $13.1 million to $24.3 million, as the project neared completion toward the end of 2012.
In 2012, the Company incurred $7.6 million of restructuring-related costs associated with Project Renewal.
Lastly, $6.3 million of incremental costs in 2011 associated with the Company’s Chief Executive Officer transition did not recur in 2012.The Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $382.6 million during 2011, principally relating to the impairment of goodwill in the Company’s Baby & Parenting and Hardware businesses.
There were no similar charges recorded during 2012.The Company recorded restructuring costs of $56.1 million and $50.1 million for 2012 and 2011, respectively.
The restructuring costs in 2012 relate to Project Renewal and the European Transformation Plan and consisted of $44.0 million of employee severance, termination benefits and employee relocation costs, $12.8 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs, and a net benefit of $0.7 million for facility and other exits, including impairment costs.
The restructuring costs for 2011 relate to Project Renewal and the European Transformation Plan and consisted of $8.4 million of facility and other exit and impairment costs, $33.2 million of employee severance, termination benefits and employee relocation costs, and $8.5 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs.
See Footnote 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Operating income for 2012 was 11.0% of net sales, or $651.9 million, versus 4.4% of net sales, or $257.2 million for 2011.
Excluding the impact of the $382.6 million of impairment charges, which were 6.5% of net sales, operating income for 2011 would be $639.8 million, or 10.9% of net sales for 2011.Net nonoperating expenses for 2012 were $86.0 million versus $104.7 million for 2011.
Interest expense for 2012 was $76.1 million, a decrease of $10.1 million from $86.2 million for 2011, due to lower average debt levels in 2012.
Losses related to extinguishments of debt were $10.9 million for 2012 compared to $4.8 million in 2011.
During 2012, the Company has recognized foreign exchange transactional gains of $2.3 million compared to foreign exchange losses of $14.7 million for 2011, as currencies generally appreciated against the U.S. Dollar during 2012 compared to depreciating in the prior year.The Company recognized income tax expense of $166.3 million and $17.9 million for 2012 and 2011, respectively.
The increase in income tax expense is primarily attributable to pretax income in 2012 and a change in the geographical mix in earnings, as well as $23.1 million of income tax expense attributable to charges resulting from incremental tax contingencies and the expiration of various statutes of limitation and audit settlements.
The income tax expense in 2011 is net of a $76.2 million tax benefit the Company was able to record associated with a portion of the $382.6 million of impairment charges.
Additionally, the 2011 income tax expense is net of the favorable impact of $49.0 million of benefits due to the reversal of accruals for certain tax contingencies, including interest and penalties, upon the expiration of various worldwide statutes of limitation.
The net income from discontinued operations was $1.7 million for 2012 compared to net loss from discontinued operations of $9.4 million for 2011.
Income (loss) from discontinued operations during 2012 and 2011 primarily relate to the Company’s hand 27Table of Contentstorch and solder business which was sold on July 1, 2011.
During 2012, all conditions related to the escrow were satisfied and resolved, and the Company had received $7.8 million from the escrow and recognized the proceeds as a gain from the sale of the hand torch and solder business in discontinued operations.
The loss on disposal of discontinued operations for 2011 related to the disposal of the hand torch and solder business.
See Footnote 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Results of Operations — 2011 vs. 2010Net sales for 2011 were $5,864.6 million, representing an increase of $206.4 million, or 3.6%, from $5,658.2 million for 2010.
The following table sets forth an analysis of changes in consolidated net sales for 2011 as compared to 2010 (in millions, except percentages):Core sales$102.0 1.8%Foreign currency104.4 1.8Total change in net sales$206.4 3.6%Core sales increased 1.8% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in the Company’s international businesses, particularly in emerging markets, with double-digit core sales growth in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions, across substantially all segments.
Excluding foreign currency, sales at the Company’s international and North American businesses increased 3.5% and 1.2%, respectively.
Foreign currency contributed 1.8% to the increase in net sales.Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, for 2011 was 37.6%, or $2,205.2 million, versus 38.0% of net sales, or $2,148.7 million, for 2010.
The primary drivers of the 40 basis point gross margin decrease were input and sourced product cost inflation, partially offset by pricing and productivity.SG&A expenses for 2011 were 25.8% of net sales, or $1,515.3 million, versus 25.6% of net sales, or $1,447.8 million, for 2010.
In constant currency, SG&A expenses increased $36.6 million due to $39.8 million of incremental investments in brand building and other strategic SG&A activities to support marketing initiatives, advertising and promotions, new market entries and global expansion.
SG&A expenses for 2011 include $6.3 million of incremental costs incurred due to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer transition and an increase of $22.2 million in restructuring-related costs for the European Transformation Plan.
The aforementioned increases were partially offset by $31.7 million lower structural SG&A costs, which resulted primarily from lower incentive compensation costs in 2011 compared to 2010.As a result of the Company’s annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $382.6 million during 2011, principally relating to the impairment of goodwill in the Company’s Baby & Parenting and Hardware businesses.
There were no similar charges recorded during 2010.The Company recorded restructuring costs of $50.1 million and $77.4 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively.
The year-over-year decrease in restructuring costs was attributable to the completion of Project Acceleration in 2010.
The restructuring costs for 2011 relate to Project Renewal and the European Transformation Plan and consisted of $8.4 million of facility and other exit and impairment costs; $33.2 million of employee severance, termination benefits and employee relocation costs; and $8.5 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs.
The restructuring costs in 2010 primarily relate to Project Acceleration and included $6.0 million of facility and other exit and impairment costs; $53.5 million of employee severance, termination benefits and employee relocation costs; and $17.9 million of exited contractual commitments and other restructuring costs.
See Footnote 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Operating income for 2011 was 4.4% of net sales, or $257.2 million, versus 11.0% of net sales, or $623.5 million for 2010.
Excluding the impact of the $382.6 million of impairment charges, which were 6.5% of net sales, operating income for 2011 would be $639.8 million, or 10.9% of net sales.Net nonoperating expenses for 2011 were $104.7 million versus $329.7 million for 2010.
Interest expense for 2011 was $86.2 million, a decrease of $32.2 million from $118.4 million for 2010, due to lower overall borrowing costs resulting from the Capital Structure Optimization Plan, a more favorable interest rate environment and a higher mix of short-term borrowings.
Losses related to extinguishments of debt were $4.8 million for 2011 compared to $218.6 million in 2010.
The losses related to extinguishments of debt of $218.6 million recognized in 2010 relate to the retirement of $279.3 million of the $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 10.60% senior unsecured notes due April 2019 and $324.7 million principal amount of the $345.0 million 5.50% convertible senior notes due 2014 pursuant to the Capital Structure Optimization Plan.

The following table depicts the Company’s cash conversion cycle at December 31, (in number of days): 2012 2011 2010Accounts receivable67 61 62Inventory66 68 69Accounts payable(50) (46) (47)Cash conversion cycle83 83 84The Company’s cash conversion cycle is impacted by the seasonality of its businesses and generally tends to be longer in the first and second quarters, based on historical trends, due to inventory build-ups early in the year for seasonal sales activity and credit terms provided to customers.
For 2012, the increase in accounts receivable days is attributable to the timing of sales in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, and this increase was offset by the combined improvements in inventory and accounts payable days.
The Company’s cash conversion cycle at December 31, 2012 approximated its cash conversion cycle at December 31, 2011 and 2010.
The Company has leveraged the implementation of SAP in North America to improve working capital over the past several years, with a focus on reducing the number of days of inventory on hand.Financial PositionThe Company is committed to maintaining a strong financial position through maintaining sufficient levels of available liquidity, managing working capital, and monitoring the Company’s overall capitalization.
•Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2012 were $183.8 million, and the Company had $800.0 million of borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility.•Working capital at December 31, 2012 was $700.3 million compared to $487.1 million at December 31, 2011, and the current ratio at December 31, 2012 was 1.45:1 compared to 1.29:1 at December 31, 2011.
The increase in working capital 35Table of Contentsand the current ratio is primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable balances due to the timing of sales in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter in 2011 and lower combined levels of short-term and current portion of long-term debt, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable.•The Company monitors its overall capitalization by evaluating net debt to total capitalization.
Net debt to total capitalization is defined as the sum of short- and long-term debt, less cash, divided by the sum of total debt and stockholders’ equity, less cash.
Net debt to total capitalization was 0.46:1 and 0.52:1 at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.The Company has from time to time refinanced, redeemed or repurchased its debt and taken other steps to reduce its debt or lease obligations or otherwise improve its overall financial position and balance sheet.
Going forward, depending on market conditions, its cash positions and other considerations, the Company may continue to take such actions.Borrowing ArrangementsIn December 2011, the Company entered into a five-year credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks.
The Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility with a maturity date of December 2, 2016, and an aggregate commitment at any time outstanding of up to $800.0 million (the “Facility”).
In December 2012, the Company obtained an extension of the term of the Credit Agreement for a period of one year beyond its original maturity date such that the Credit Agreement will expire on December 1, 2017.
The Facility provides the committed backup liquidity for the issuance of commercial paper and accordingly, commercial paper may be issued only up to the amount available for borrowing under the Facility.
The Facility also provides for the issuance of up to $100.0 million of letters of credit, so long as there is a sufficient amount available for borrowing under the Facility.
As of December 31, 2012, there were no borrowings or standby letters of credit issued or outstanding under the Facility, and there was no commercial paper outstanding.
Concurrent with the Company’s entry into the Credit Agreement, the Company terminated its $665.0 million syndicated revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in November 2012.In addition to the committed portion of the Facility, the Credit Agreement provides for extensions of competitive bid loans from one or more lenders (at the lenders’ discretion) of up to $500.0 million, which are not a utilization of the amount available for borrowing under the Facility.
In September 2012, the Company renewed its 364-day receivables financing facility that provides for maximum borrowings of up to $200.0 million such that it will expire in September 2013.
As of December 31, 2012, aggregate borrowings of $200.0 million were outstanding under the facility at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.9%.The following table presents the maximum and average daily borrowings outstanding under the Company’s short-term borrowing arrangements during the years ended December 31, (in millions): 2012 2011Short-term Borrowing ArrangementMaximum Average Maximum AverageCommercial paper$392.8 $163.6 $214.5 $80.0Receivables financing facility200.0 128.3 200.0 160.1The indentures governing the Company’s medium-term notes contain usual and customary nonfinancial covenants.
The Company’s borrowing arrangements other than the medium-term notes contain usual and customary nonfinancial covenants and certain financial covenants, including minimum interest coverage and maximum debt-to-total-capitalization ratios.
As defined by the agreements governing the borrowing arrangements, minimum interest coverage ratio is computed as adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) divided by adjusted interest expense for the four most recent quarterly periods.
Generally, maximum debt-to-total-capitalization is calculated as the sum of short-term and long-term debt divided by the sum of (i) total debt, (ii) total stockholders’ equity and (iii) a specified dollar amount ranging from $550.0 million to $750.0 million related to impairment charges incurred by the Company.
As of December 31, 2012, the Company had complied with all covenants under the indentures and its other borrowing arrangements, and the Company could access the full borrowing capacity available under the Facility and utilize the $800.0 million for general corporate purposes without exceeding the debt-to-total-capitalization limits in its financial covenants.
A failure to maintain the financial covenants would impair the Company’s ability to borrow under the Facility and the receivables facility and may result in the acceleration of the repayment of certain indebtedness.36Table of ContentsDebtThe Company has varying needs for short-term working capital financing as a result of the seasonal nature of its business.
The volume and timing of production impacts the Company’s cash flows and has historically involved increased production in the first quarter of the year to meet increased customer demand through the remainder of the year.
Working capital fluctuations have historically been financed through short-term financing arrangements, such as commercial paper or borrowings under the Facility or receivables facility.As of December 31, 2012, the current portion of long-term debt and short-term debt totaled $211.9 million, including $200.0 million of borrowings under the receivables facility.Total debt was $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, a decrease of $258.4 million.
During 2012, the Company repaid $250.0 million of the 2012 Notes and repaid $8.5 million of the 2028 Notes.
In July 2012, the Company redeemed the $436.7 million outstanding principal amount of the Debentures that underlie the Preferred Securities.
In December 2012, the Company repaid the $500.0 million of 2013 Notes.
The decrease in total debt due to repayments in 2012 was partially offset by issuances of an aggregate of $850 million principal amount of medium-term notes and a $100.0 million increase in borrowings under the receivables facility during 2012.
The following table presents the average outstanding debt and weighted-average interest rates for the years ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): 2012 2011 2010Average outstanding debt$2,195.5 $2,351.3 $2,461.0Average interest rate(1)3.5% 3.6% 4.8% (1) The average interest rate includes the impacts of fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps.
The Company’s floating-rate debt, which includes medium-term notes that are subject to fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps, was 51.7% and 17.7% of total debt as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
The increase in floating-rate debt is primarily due to fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps related to $500.0 million of 4.7% medium-term notes due 2020 that were entered into during 2012, whereas in 2011, the Company terminated and settled fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps relating to $750.0 million principal amount of medium-term notes.
Additionally, borrowings under the receivables facility were $200.0 million at December 31, 2012, an increase of $100.0 million compared to December 31, 2011.
See Footnote 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.Pension and Other Postretirement Plan ObligationsThe Company sponsors pension plans in the U.S. and in various other countries.
The Company’s ongoing funding requirements for its pension plans are largely dependent on the value of each of the plan’s assets and the investment returns realized on plan assets, as well as the interest rate environment.
In 2012 and 2011, the Company made cash contributions of $48.5 million and $20.4 million, respectively, to its primary U.S. defined benefit pension plan.
The Company expects to contribute approximately $144 million to its worldwide pension and other postretirement plans in 2013, which includes $100 million contributed in January 2013 to its primary U.S. defined benefit pension plan.Future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets.
During 2012, the projected benefit obligations of the Company’s defined benefit plans increased approximately $170 million, primarily due to the decline in interest rates.
The Company determines its plan asset investment mix, in part, on the duration of each plan’s liabilities.
To the extent each plan’s assets decline in value or do not generate the returns expected by the Company or to the extent the pension liabilities increase due to declines in interest rates or otherwise, the Company may be required to make contributions to the pension plans to ensure the pension obligations are adequately funded as required by law or mandate.DividendsThe Company’s Board of Directors approved a 25% increase in the Company’s quarterly dividend from $0.08 per share to $0.10 per share, effective with the quarterly dividend paid in June 2012, and further increased the quarterly dividend by 50% from $0.10 per share to $0.15 per share, effective with the Company's dividend paid in December 2012.
The Company intends to maintain dividends at a level such that operating cash flows can be used to fund growth initiatives and restructuring activities, and at the Company's discretion, to repay outstanding debt.37Table of ContentsThe payment of dividends to holders of the Company’s common stock remains at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the Company’s financial condition, earnings, legal requirements, payout ratio and other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant.Share Repurchase ProgramIn August 2011, the Company announced a $300.0 million share repurchase program (the “SRP”).
Under the SRP, the Company may repurchase its own shares of common stock through a combination of a 10b5-1 automatic trading plan, discretionary market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions.
The SRP is authorized to run for a period of three years ending in August 2014.
During 2012, the Company repurchased 4.9 million shares pursuant to the SRP for $91.5 million, and such shares were immediately retired.
From the commencement of the SRP in August 2011 through December 31, 2012, the Company has repurchased and retired a total of 8.3 million shares for $137.6 million.
During January 2013, the Company purchased an additional 0.5 million shares at an aggregate cost of $12.3 million.
The repurchase of additional shares will depend upon many factors, including the Company’s financial condition, liquidity and legal requirements.Credit RatingsThe Company’s credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies.
The Company’s current senior and short-term debt credit ratings from three credit rating agencies are listed below: Senior DebtCredit Rating Short-term DebtCredit Rating Outlook
Moody’s Investors ServiceBaa3 P-3 StableStandard & Poor’sBBB- A-3 StableFitch RatingsBBB F-2 StableOutlookFor the year ending December 31, 2013, the Company expects to generate cash flows from operations of $575 to $625 million after restructuring and restructuring-related cash payments of $70 to $90 million and approximately $100 million in contributions to the Company’s primary U.S. pension plan.
The Company plans to fund capital expenditures of approximately $175 to $200 million, which include expenditures associated with the implementation of SAP in Brazil.Overall, the Company believes that available cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated from future operations, access to capital markets, and availability under the Facility and receivables facility will be adequate to support the cash needs of existing businesses.
The Company plans to use available cash, borrowing capacity, cash flows from future operations and alternative financing arrangements to repay debt maturities as they come due, including short-term debt of $210.7 million, primarily representing borrowings under the receivables facility.Resolution of Income Tax Contingencies In 2011 and 2010, the Company recorded $49.0 million and $79.3 million, respectively, in net income tax benefits as a result of the favorable resolution of certain tax matters with taxing authorities and the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain tax matters.
In 2012, amounts recognized as income tax benefits as a result of the favorable resolution of certain tax matters with taxing authorities and the expiration of the statute of limitations were not material.
These benefits are reflected in the Company’s 2012, 2011 and 2010 Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The ultimate resolution of outstanding tax matters may be different from that reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals, which may adversely impact future operating results and cash flows.
Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has outstanding debt obligations maturing at various dates through 2028.
Certain other items, such as purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized as liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed.
Examples of items not recognized as liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of December 31, 2012, and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements.
38Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the effect that lease and other material contractual obligations are expected to have on the Company’s cash flow in the indicated period.
In addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2012.
Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (in millions): Payments Due by Period TotalLess than 1 Year1-3 Years3-5 YearsMore than 5 YearsDebt(1)$1,918.4$211.9$250.0$350.0$1,106.5Interest on debt(2)453.167.2129.4121.9134.6Operating lease obligations(3)457.3105.5149.998.0103.9Purchase obligations(4)742.9645.697.3——Total contractual obligations(5)$3,571.7$1,030.2$626.6$569.9$1,345.0(1)Amounts represent contractual obligations based on the earliest date that the obligation may become due, excluding interest, based on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2012.
Includes $200.0 million in borrowings under the receivables facility that the Company intends to repay or refinance before maturity in September 2013.
For further information relating to these obligations, see Footnote 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
(2)Amounts represent estimated interest payable on borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2012, excluding the impact of interest rate swaps that adjust the fixed rate to a floating rate for $750.0 million of medium-term notes.
Interest on floating-rate debt was estimated using the rate in effect as of December 31, 2012.
For further information, see Footnote 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
(3)Amounts represent contractual minimum lease obligations on operating leases as of December 31, 2012.
For further information relating to these obligations, see Footnote 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
(4)Primarily consists of purchase commitments entered into as of December 31, 2012 for finished goods, raw materials, components and services pursuant to legally enforceable and binding obligations, which include all significant terms.
(5)Total does not include contractual obligations reported on the December 31, 2012 balance sheet as current liabilities, except for current portion of long-term debt and short-term debt.
The Company also has liabilities for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits.
As a large taxpayer, the Company is under audit from time-to-time by the IRS and other taxing authorities, and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming year.
While it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the $112.7 million in unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, at December 31, 2012, is excluded from the preceding table.
See Footnote 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Additionally, the Company has obligations with respect to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans, which are excluded from the preceding table.
The timing and amounts of the funding requirements are uncertain because they are dependent on interest rates and actual returns on plan assets, among other factors.
As of December 31, 2012, the Company had liabilities of $727.7 million related to its unfunded and underfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans for which the Company expects to make contributions of $144 million in 2013.
See Footnote 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
As of December 31, 2012, the Company had $45.7 million in standby letters of credit primarily related to the Company’s self-insurance programs, including workers’ compensation, product liability and medical.
See Footnote 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.As of December 31, 2012, the Company did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.Critical Accounting PoliciesThe Company’s accounting policies are more fully described in Footnote 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
As disclosed in that footnote, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes.
Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty.
Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment.
Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The following sections describe the Company’s critical accounting policies.
39Table of ContentsSales Recognition Sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership transfer, which generally occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms.
Sales are net of provisions for cash discounts, returns, customer discounts (such as volume or trade discounts), cooperative advertising and other sales-related discounts.
Recovery of Accounts Receivable The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.
When aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position, the Company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes is collectible.
The Company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience.
Accounts are reviewed for potential write-off on a case-by-case basis.
Accounts deemed uncollectible are written off, net of expected recoveries.
If circumstances related to specific customers change, the Company’s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.
Inventory Reserves The Company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow-moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
Net provisions for excess and obsolete inventories, including shrink reserves, totaled $38.3 million, $26.9 million and $18.4 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are included in cost of products sold.
If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible AssetsGoodwillThe Company performs its annual impairment testing of goodwill at a reporting unit level, and all of the Company's goodwill is assigned to the Company's reporting units.
For the Company’s annual impairment testing in 2012, reporting units, which were referred to as the Company's Global Business Units (“GBU”), were one level below the operating segment level.
Effective January 1, 2012, the Company, as part of Project Renewal, implemented certain changes to its organizational structure that resulted in the consolidation of the Company's 13 global business units ("GBU") into nine; and, as a result, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing for the nine GBUs.
Acquired businesses, if any, including goodwill arising from such transactions, are integrated into the Company's existing reporting units.
As of July 1, 2012, the Company had nine reporting units with total goodwill of $2.4 billion.
Four of the Company's nine reporting units accounted for over 70 percent of the Company's total goodwill.
These four reporting units were as follows: Writing & Creative Expression; Commercial Products; Technology; and Industrial Products & Services.The Company conducts its annual test of impairment of goodwill as of the first day of the third quarter because it generally coincides with its annual strategic planning process.
The Company also tests for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount.
For example, if macroeconomic factors, such as consumer demand and consumer confidence, deteriorate materially such that the Company's reporting units' projected sales and operating income decline significantly relative to previous estimates, the Company will perform an interim test to assess whether goodwill is impaired.
Other than the annual impairment test, the Company determined that no tests of impairment were necessary during 2012.In the Company's goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, impairment may be present.
Estimates made by management in performing its impairment testing may impact whether or not an impairment charge is necessary and the magnitude of the corresponding impairment charge to the extent one is recorded.
The Company uses multiple valuation approaches in its impairment testing, each of which requires estimates to arrive at an estimate of fair value.
For the Company's reporting units that are stable businesses and have a history of generating positive operating income and cash flows, the Company relies on a multiple of earnings approach to assess fair value.
The material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using this approach are the reporting units' estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year and the applicable multiple to apply to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”).
The estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year is based on the Company's internal forecasting process.
To determine the EBITDA multiple, the Company obtains information from third parties on EBITDA multiples observed for recent acquisitions and other transactions in the marketplace for comparable businesses.
The Company also evaluates the EBITDA multiples of publicly traded companies that are in the same industry and are comparable to each reporting unit and compares the EBITDA multiples of the publicly traded companies to the multiples used by the Company to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit.
The Company evaluates the EBITDA multiples used to value the reporting units relative to the Company's market capitalization plus an equity 40Table of Contentscontrol premium.
The equity control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units' estimated market values compared to the Company's market value, with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the market value of the Company.
The Company considers premiums paid by acquirers of comparable businesses to determine the reasonableness of the implied control premium.The EBITDA multiple observed in the marketplace for publicly traded companies that are comparable to the reporting units ranged from 6 to 10.
In using the EBITDA multiples, the Company compared the aggregate value of all reporting units to the Company's total market value to validate the aggregate values of the reporting units resulted in a reasonable implied equity control premium.
The Company considers several factors in estimating the EBITDA multiple applicable to each reporting unit, including the reporting unit's market position, brand awareness, gross and operating margins, and prospects for growth, among other factors.
After adjusting the EBITDA multiples for the reporting units, no potential goodwill impairment was indicated for reporting units for which this approach was used.
Furthermore, the Company's equity market value at July 1, 2012 of approximately $5.3 billion was significantly in excess of its book value of stockholders' equity of approximately $2.0 billion.
For the impairment test as of July 1, 2012, if each reporting unit's EBITDA multiple were reduced by 1.0 from the 6 to 10 multiple used for each reporting unit, all reporting units where the EBITDA multiple approach was used to value the reporting unit would have passed Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test.The Company relies on a discounted cash flow approach to value reporting units in certain circumstances, such as when the reporting unit is growing at a significantly slower rate than planned, is declining at a significantly faster rate than the overall market, has experienced significant losses, is in a stage of hyper-growth, is executing significant restructuring efforts, or is in a stage of development where it has not yet fully realized the benefits of scale and operating efficiencies.
The Company used the discounted cash flow approach to value the Technology reporting unit for the annual impairment test as of July 1, 2012.
The material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow approach are the future financial performance and cash flows of the reporting unit, the discount rate, long-term sales growth rate, and the working capital investment required.
Estimates of future financial performance include estimates of future sales growth rates, raw material and sourced product costs, currency fluctuations, and operating efficiencies to be realized.
The Company determines a discount rate based on an estimate of a reasonable risk-adjusted return an investor would expect to realize on an investment in the reporting unit.
In using the discounted cash flow approach to value the Technology reporting unit in 2012, the Company used an average compound long-term sales growth rate of 2%, average operating margins generally ranging from 14% to 18%, and a discount rate of 12%.
The Company concluded that the Technology reporting unit passed Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test based on the estimated fair value determined using the discounted cash flow approach.If the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the Technology reporting unit increased 100 basis points, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would have declined by approximately $60 million and would have resulted in a fair value, which was approximately 1% less than the net assets of the reporting unit.
Additional valuation procedures would have been required to determine whether the Technology reporting unit's goodwill was impaired, and to the extent goodwill was impaired, the magnitude of the impairment charge.
The carrying amount of goodwill assigned to the Technology reporting unit was approximately $360 million as of July 1, 2012.The Company continues to implement specific restructuring projects and business and operational strategies to further strengthen the profitability of the Technology reporting unit.
The Company continues to monitor whether these initiatives are being executed as planned and are successful in improving the financial performance of the reporting unit.
To the extent the Company is not successful in implementing these projects and strategies, it is possible the Company would record goodwill impairment charges associated with the Technology reporting unit in future periods.
The Technology reporting unit has been adversely affected by the decline in government spending and its impact on the classroom technology industry, as well as weaker macroeconomic conditions throughout Western Europe.
Other than the Technology reporting unit, the Company has no reporting units whose estimated fair values at July 1, 2012 exceeded net assets by less than 10% of the reporting unit's net assets.Indefinite-Lived Intangible AssetsThe Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $310.1 million as of July 1, 2012.
The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2012-02, "Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment," which permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test.
Under ASU 2012-02, the Company has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test.
Additionally, the Company may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.
41Table of ContentsIn performing the qualitative assessment for each of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company considered events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, including factors such as declines in actual or planned revenue or negative or declining cash flows; input cost inflation that may have a negative effect on future cash flows; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business or other factors; and, other entity-specific events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy or customers.
Based on the qualitative assessment, if the Company was unable to assert that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, then the Company would proceed with the quantitative impairment test for such asset.
For the quantitative impairment test, the Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangible assets by employing a discounted cash flow model using the relief-from-royalty method, which estimates royalties to be derived in the future use of the asset were the Company to license the use of the trade name.
An impairment charge for indefinite-lived intangible assets is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date.
The Company completed its annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of July 1, 2012, and determined that none of its indefinite-lived intangible assets were impaired.The Company considers qualitative and quantitative factors in determining whether impairment testing of the trademark and trade name assets is necessary at dates other than the annual impairment testing date, such as whether the Company has plans to abandon or significantly reduce the use of a trademark or trade name.
Based on consideration of these factors, the Company determined that no impairment indicators have been present, and therefore, impairment testing as of a date other than July 1, 2012 was not required during 2012.Potential for Future ImpairmentsAs of December 31, 2012, the Company had goodwill of $2.4 billion and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $311.1 million.
The Company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets.
Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the Company's customer base and net sales, a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers, or sustained declines in the Company's market capitalization relative to its reported stockholders' equity.
The Company periodically evaluates the impact of economic and other conditions on the Company and its reporting units to assess whether impairment indicators are present.
The Company may be required to perform additional impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors, which could result in impairment charges in the future.
Although management cannot predict when improvements in macroeconomic conditions will occur, if consumer confidence and consumer spending decline significantly in the future or if commercial and industrial economic activity deteriorates significantly from current levels, it is reasonably likely the Company will be required to record impairment charges in the future.Capitalized Software Costs The Company capitalizes costs associated with internal-use software during the application development stage after both the preliminary project stage has been completed and the Company’s management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development.
Capitalized internal-use software costs include: (i) external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software; (ii) payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project; and (iii) interest costs incurred while developing the software.
Capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose.
The Company expenses as incurred research and development, general and administrative, and indirect costs associated with internal-use software.
In addition, the Company expenses as incurred training, maintenance and other internal-use software costs incurred during the post-implementation stage.
Costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of internal-use software are capitalized only if such modifications result in additional functionality of the software.
The Company capitalized $43.9 million of software costs during 2012, which primarily relate to employee, consultant and related personnel costs incurred in the rollout of SAP in the European region and in Brazil.
Capitalized software costs net of accumulated amortization were $269.2 million at December 31, 2012.
Capitalized interest costs included in capitalized software were not material as of December 31, 2012.The Company amortizes internal-use software costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which typically ranges from 3 to 12 years.
Capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of impairment, including but not limited to a significant change in available technology or the manner in which the software is being used.
Impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values.
Other Long-Lived Assets The Company continuously evaluates if impairment indicators related to its property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are present.
These impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset or asset group, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical 42Table of Contentscondition, or a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset or asset group.
If impairment indicators are present, the Company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets.
The sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount.
The cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses, working capital, and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the Company’s strategic plan.
If the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, the Company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group.
Generally, the Company performs its testing of the asset group at the product-line level, as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available.
Product Liability Reserves The Company has a self-insurance program for product liability that includes reserves for self-retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance.
The Company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods, review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves.
The Company’s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the Company’s product liability reserve.
The Company has product liability reserves of $33.0 million as of December 31, 2012.
While the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims, the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the Company, and such additional losses may be material to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
Legal and Environmental Reserves The Company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, as well as contract and other disputes.
The Company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and determines the probable loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows for certain environmental matters.
The estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated.
No insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the Company’s cost estimates or reserve, nor do the Company’s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes, except with respect to long-term operations and maintenance, Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability (“CERCLA”) and other matters which are estimated at present value.
The Company’s estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of December 31, 2012, ranged between $21.9 million and $25.4 million.
As of December 31, 2012, the Company had a reserve of $22.3 million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate, which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Income Taxes In accordance with relevant authoritative guidance, the Company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach.
Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by current enacted tax rates.
Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.
No provision is made for the U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, as substantially all such earnings are permanently reinvested.
The Company’s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the IRS and other tax authorities.
Although the Company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, it has established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken, which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest.
The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies.
For uncertain tax positions, the Company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance, which requires application of a “more likely than not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions.
The Company’s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the Company’s effective tax rate as well as impact operating results.
See Footnote 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
43Table of ContentsPensions and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts.
The primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates, health care cost trend rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates and rate of compensation increases, as discussed below: •Discount rates: The Company generally estimates the discount rate for its pension and other postretirement benefit obligations using an iterative process based on a hypothetical investment in a portfolio of high-quality bonds that approximate the estimated cash flows of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.
The Company believes this approach permits a matching of future cash outflows related to benefit payments with future cash inflows associated with bond coupons and maturities.
•Health care cost trend rate: The Company’s health care cost trend rate is based on historical retiree cost data, near-term health care outlook, and industry benchmarks and surveys.•Expected return on plan assets: The Company’s expected return on plan assets is derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies and historical and anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes.
The Company’s analysis gives consideration to historical returns and long-term, prospective rates of return.
•Mortality rates: Mortality rates are based on actual and projected plan experience.•Rate of compensation increase: The rate of compensation increases reflects the Company’s long-term actual experience and its outlook, including consideration of expected rates of inflation.
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods, and therefore, generally affect recognized expense in future periods.
While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the Company’s pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense.
See Footnote 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the assumptions used.

The Company used a weighted-average expected return on assets of 6.9% to determine the expense for the pension plans for 2012.

The unrecognized gains and losses primarily result from changes to life expectancies and other actuarial assumptions, changes in discount rates, as well as actual returns on plan assets being more or less than expected.
The unrecognized gain (loss) for each plan is amortized to expense over the life of each plan.
The net amount amortized to expense totaled $24.8 million (pretax) in 2012, and amortization of unrecognized net losses is expected to continue to result in increases in pension and other postretirement plan expenses for the foreseeable future.
Changes in actuarial assumptions, changes in discount rates, actual returns on plan assets and changes in the actuarially determined life of the plans impact the amount of unrecognized gain (loss) recognized as expense annually.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Footnote 1—Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies—Recent Accounting Pronouncements.” International Operations For 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company’s non-U.S. businesses accounted for approximately 32%, 33% and 32% of net sales, respectively (see Footnote 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
Changes in both U.S. and non-U.S. net sales are shown below for the years ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): 
 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 2012 2011 2010 % Change % ChangeU.S.$4,004.5 $3,915.7 $3,870.3 2.3 % 1.2%Non-U.S1,898.2 1,948.9 1,787.9 (2.6) 9.0 $5,902.7 $5,864.6 $5,658.2 0.6 % 3.6%The Company began accounting for its Venezuelan operations using highly inflationary accounting in January 2010.
Under highly inflationary accounting, the Company remeasures assets, liabilities, sales and expenses denominated in Bolivar Fuertes into U.S.
Dollars using the applicable exchange rate, and the resulting translation adjustments are included in earnings.
As of December 31, 2012, the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary had $63.4 million of net monetary assets denominated in Bolivar Fuertes, and as a result, a 10% increase (decrease) in the applicable exchange rate would result in a one-time estimated pretax charge (benefit) of $6 million.
On an ongoing basis, excluding the impacts of any actions management might otherwise take in response to a change in exchange rates, such as raising or decreasing prices, a 10% increase (decrease) in the exchange rate would unfavorably (favorably) impact annual net sales and operating income by an estimated $5 million and $3 million, respectively.
In May 2010, the Venezuelan government enacted reforms to its foreign currency exchange control regulations to close down the parallel exchange market.
In early June 2010, the Venezuelan government introduced a newly regulated foreign currency exchange system, Transaction System for Foreign Currency Denominated Securities (“SITME”).
Foreign currency exchange through SITME is allowed within a specified band of 4.5 to 5.3 Bolivar Fuerte to U.S. Dollar, but most of the exchanges have been executed at 45Table of Contentsthe rate of 5.3 Bolivar Fuerte to U.S. Dollar.
The Company began applying the SITME rate of 5.3 Bolivar Fuerte to U.S. Dollar in May 2010.
The transition to the SITME rate from the parallel rate did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated net sales or operating income for 2010 compared to using the parallel rate for the same period.
The transition to the SITME rate did result in a one-time foreign exchange gain of $5.6 million, which is recognized in other income in 2010.
Since the introduction of SITME in June 2010, the Venezuelan government held the rate constant at 5.3 Bolivar Fuerte to U.S. Dollar until February 2013.
In February 2013, the exchange rate for Bolivar Fuertes declined to 6.3 Bolivar Fuertes to U.S. Dollar and the SITME rate is no longer available.
As a result, the Company expects to record an estimated $10 million one-time charge in the first quarter of 2013, based on the decline in value of the net monetary assets of its Venezuelan operations that are denominated in Bolivar Fuertes at the time the devaluation is effective.
In addition, the Company’s 2013 reported net sales and operating income are expected to be adversely impacted by an estimated $9 million and $5 million, respectively, due solely to the devaluation of the Bolivar Fuerte.The Company is unable to predict with certainty whether future devaluations will occur because of the economic uncertainty in Venezuela; however, future devaluations would adversely impact the Company’s future financial results.
Any change in the rate would not impact reported changes in core sales, which exclude the impact of foreign currency.
Fair Value Measurements Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Various valuation techniques exist for measuring fair value, including the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost).
These valuation techniques are based upon observable and unobservable inputs.
Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s market assumptions.
The authoritative accounting guidance for fair value provides a hierarchy that prioritizes these two inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
The following is a brief description of those three levels: •Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
•Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for similar or identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.
•Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions.
The Company’s assets and liabilities adjusted to fair value at least annually are its money market fund investments, included in cash and cash equivalents; mutual fund investments, included in other assets; and derivative instruments, primarily included in prepaid expenses and other, other assets, other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities, and these assets and liabilities are therefore subject to the measurement and disclosure requirements outlined in the authoritative guidance.
The Company determines the fair value of its money market fund investments based on the values of the underlying assets (Level 2) and its mutual fund investments based on quoted market prices (Level 1).
The Company generally uses derivatives for hedging purposes, and the Company’s derivatives are primarily foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps.
The Company determines the fair value of its derivative instruments using standard pricing models and market-based assumptions for all significant inputs, such as yield curves and quoted spot and forward exchange rates.
Accordingly, the Company’s derivative instruments are classified as Level 2.Forward-Looking StatementsForward-looking statements in this Report are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Such forward-looking statements may relate to, but are not limited to, information or assumptions about the effects of sales (including pricing), income/(loss), earnings per share, return on equity, return on invested capital, operating income, operating margin or gross margin improvements or declines, Project Renewal, the European Transformation Plan, capital and other expenditures, working capital, cash flow, dividends, capital structure, debt to capitalization ratios, debt ratings, availability of financing, interest rates, restructuring and restructuring-related costs, impairment and other charges, potential losses on divestitures, impacts of changes in accounting standards, pending legal proceedings and claims (including environmental matters), future economic performance, costs and cost savings (including raw material and sourced product inflation, productivity and streamlining), synergies, management’s plans, goals and objectives for future operations, performance and growth or the assumptions relating to any of the forward-looking statements.
These statements generally are accompanied by words such as 46Table of Contents“intend,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “project,” “target,” “plan,” “expect,” “will,” “should,” “would” or similar statements.
The Company cautions that forward-looking statements are not guarantees because there are inherent difficulties in predicting future results.
Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.
Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the Company’s dependence on the strength of retail, commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in light of the continuation or escalation of the global economic slowdown or regional sovereign debt issues; currency fluctuations; competition with other manufacturers and distributors of consumer products; major retailers’ strong bargaining power; changes in the prices of raw materials and sourced products and the Company’s ability to obtain raw materials and sourced products in a timely manner from suppliers; the Company’s ability to develop innovative new products and to develop, maintain and strengthen its end-user brands; the Company’s ability to expeditiously close facilities and move operations while managing foreign regulations and other impediments; the Company’s ability to implement successfully information technology solutions throughout its organization; the Company’s ability to improve productivity and streamline operations; changes to the Company’s credit ratings; significant increases in the funding obligations related to the Company’s pension plans due to declining asset values, declining interest rates or otherwise; the imposition of tax liabilities greater than the Company’s provisions for such matters; the risks inherent in the Company’s foreign operations and those matters set forth in this Report generally and Item 1A to this Report.
In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company has correctly identified and assessed all of the factors affecting the Company or that the publicly available and other information the Company receives with respect to these factors is complete or correct.ITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMarket RiskThe Company’s market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices.
Pursuant to the Company’s policies, natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in rates and prices.
The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes.Interest RatesInterest rate risk is present with both fixed- and floating-rate debt.
The Company manages its interest rate exposure through its mix of fixed- and floating-rate debt and its conservative debt ratio target.
Interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges are used to mitigate the Company’s exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt resulting from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates.
Accordingly, benchmark interest rate fluctuations impact the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate debt, which are offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the swap agreements.
Interest rate swaps may also be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate, based on market conditions, and for qualifying hedges, the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense.
Excluding debt for which a fixed rate has been swapped for a floating rate, fixed-rate debt represented approximately 48.3% of the Company’s $1.92 billion of total debt as of December 31, 2012.Foreign Currency Exchange RatesThe Company is exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business since a portion of the Company’s sales, expenses and operating transactions is conducted on a global basis in various foreign currencies.
To the extent that business transactions are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity entering into the transaction, the Company is exposed to transactional foreign currency exchange rate risk.
The Company’s foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and third-party commercial transaction exposures of one-year duration or less.
The Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts as economic hedges for commercial transactions and to offset the future impact of gains and losses resulting from changes in the expected amount of functional currency cash flows to be received or paid upon settlement of the anticipated intercompany and third-party commercial transactions.
Gains and losses related to the settlement of qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions.
The Company also uses natural hedging techniques such as offsetting or netting like foreign currency flows and denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency.The Company also realizes gains and losses recorded within shareholders’ equity due to the translation of the financial statements from the functional currency of its subsidiaries to U.S.
Dollars.
The Company utilizes capital structures of foreign subsidiaries combined with forward contracts to minimize its exposure to foreign currency risk.
The Company may hedge portions of its net investments in foreign subsidiaries, including intercompany loans, with forward contracts and cross-currency hedges.
Gains and losses related to qualifying forward exchange contracts and cross-currency hedges, which are generally used to hedge intercompany loans and net investments in foreign subsidiaries, are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).47Table of ContentsCommodity PricesThe Company purchases certain raw materials, including resin, corrugate, steel, stainless steel, aluminum and other metals, which are subject to price volatility caused by unpredictable factors.
The Company’s resin purchases are principally comprised of polyethylene and polypropylene in roughly equal quantities.
While future movements of raw material costs are uncertain, a variety of programs, including periodic raw material purchases, purchases of raw materials for future delivery and customer price adjustments help the Company address this risk.
Where practical, the Company uses derivatives as part of its risk management process.Financial InstrumentsIn managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swaps.
Derivatives were recorded at fair value in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2012 as follows (in millions):Prepaid expenses and other$0.5Other assets$38.9Other accrued liabilities$1.3Other noncurrent liabilities$7.2See Footnote 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on derivatives.Value at RiskThe amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the Company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the value-at-risk estimation model.
The value-at-risk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods.
It estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques that are based on a variance/covariance approach and includes substantially all market risk exposures (specifically excluding cost and equity method investments).
The fair value losses shown in the table below represent the Company’s estimate of the maximum loss that could arise in one day.
The amounts presented in the table are shown as an illustration of the impact of potential adverse changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates.
The following table sets forth the one-day value-at-risk as of and for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages): Market Risk(1) 2012Average December 31,2012 2011Average December 31,2011 ConfidenceLevelInterest rates $6.6 $2.9 $10.3 $10.6 95%Foreign exchange $9.7 $6.0 $11.8 $15.5 95% (1)The Company generally does not enter into material derivative contracts for commodities; therefore, commodity price risk is not shown because the amounts are not material.The year-over-year decline in value-at-risk for interest rates is primarily due to the Company swapping a fixed rate for a short-term floating rate for $500 million of the Company’s medium-term notes due 2020, because the short-term rate has less risk compared to the longer-term rate and the shorter-term rate has less historical volatility.
The year-over-year decline in value-at-risk for foreign exchange is due to generally lower foreign currency positions at December 31, 2012 compared to December 31, 2011 and lower exchange rate volatility in late 2012 compared to late 2011.The 95% confidence interval signifies the Company’s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above.
The amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the Company’s favor.
The value-at-risk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse.
Actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time, and it is highly unlikely that the Company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time.
Additionally, since the Company operates globally, and therefore, among a broad basket of currencies, its foreign currency exposure is diversified.
These amounts should not be considered projections of future losses, because actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets.48Table of Contents
