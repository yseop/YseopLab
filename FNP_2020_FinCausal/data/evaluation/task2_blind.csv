0367.00006; With the company having a huge net cash position, a combination of dividends, net share settlements, and share repurchases has returned almost $400 billion since.
0367.00008; (Source: Apple capital return plan document, seen here)  In the past six quarters, the company has brought its net cash position down by more than a third, from $163 billion to $102 billion. That's primarily because management stepped in with some huge quarterly share repurchases.
0367.00013; If Apple reduces its net cash position by $28 billion every six months until the end of calendar 2020, then the reduction will leave it with just $18 billion in net cash.
0367.00017; Regardless of when that does actually occur, the company still produces tremendous free cash flow each fiscal year, averaging about $58 billion per fiscal year over the last five (not counting the period we are currently in) as seen below.
0367.00021; Well, the dividend is currently running at about $14 billion a year, and let's assume another $10 billion per goes to debt repayments and $1 billion goes to acquisitions. That would leave $35 billion a year to go to share repurchases, meaning Apple could still buy back more than $8 billion a quarter and still be at a cash neutral position.
0367.00023; As the company reduces its share count further by the quarter, the buyback becomes even more important for the same number of shares repurchased. For example, when the share count after the split was about 6.5 billion, a 100 million share count reduction would improve EPS by 1.54%.
0367.00024; Now, we are roughly at 4.5 billion shares, meaning every 100 million lowering now boosts EPS by 2.22%.

0545.00010; The company reported C$0.10 EPS for the quarter, missing the consensus estimate of C$0.16 by C($0.06).
0547.00012; The combination of current undervaluation and future growth in both divisions should create at least 233% upside in the coming 5 years, in my opinion.
0547.00025; The problem here is that vanadium prices fell drastically (75% in six months) as the new rebar standard was implemented poorly.
0547.00032; (Source: vanadiumprice.com)  2. AMG Technologies had a temporary bad quarter as well, with EBITDA decreasing 40% QoQ to $11.4 mln. This was caused due to lower prices in the Titanium Alloys and Coatings business and timing effects in the Engineering business.
0547.00033; As a consequence of seasonality (orders are very variable), they only signed $33 mln in orders in Q2.
0547.00043; (Source: AMG Investor relations)  AMG Technologies valuation  CEO Heinz said  we should expect flat EBITDA in AMG Technologies basically year-on-year in 2019. Thus, in my assumption I take $68 mln in EBITDA for 2019.
0547.00045; I expect them to resume the growth trajectory with 20% annual EBITDA growth because Heinz stated in the cc that we can expect more growth ahead of us:  And it also refers to the titanium aluminide, which are especially strong and where we are about to increase our contractual position -- sales position substantially.
0547.00050; Total EBITDA is guided at $120 mln in 2019. As such, Critical Materials' EBITDA should be at least $52 mln.
0547.00051; According to Heinz, the EBITDA run rate is $150 mln under normal circumstances (no extraordinary price fluctuations for vanadium). Consequently, 2020 EBITDA is expected to be at least $150 mln.
0547.00054; AMG has low operational costs of $270/mt, while current spot prices are $680/mt. Thus, it would create $12.3 mln annual ebitda.
0547.00055; Secondly, AMG announced that it will at least double its recycling capacity in 2021, which would probably start adding to profitability in 2022. I guess that Cambridge 1, the current recycling factory, creates $50 mln annual EBITDA (consisting of fees and vanadium sales). Thus, this new facility (Cambridge 2) should add at least another $50 mln in EBITDA.
0547.00060.1; I use a 4x EV/EBITDA multiple for this division which is very low because it is currently seen as a cyclical business, operating in mining and materials. In Q2 for example, the prices of AMG's materials portfolio were the lowest in the history of the company. Consequently, EBITDA sank by a stunning 66% YoY in this division.

In Q2 for example, the prices of AMG's materials portfolio were the lowest in the history of the company. Consequently, EBITDA sank by a stunning 66% YoY in this division.
0547.00065; As you can see in the table, value per share could grow to $71.96 in 2024, a 233% gain from today's share price. Adding both divisions together, EBITDA could grow from $120 mln in 2019 to $353 mln in 2024 based on my calculations.
0547.00072; As calculated above, the division should be valued $21.07 per share based on $82 mln EBITDA in 2020 and a conservative EV/EBITDA multiple of 9.
0547.00073; If the Technologies division could achieve this valuation via a separate listing, it will be very unlikely that AMG stock would drop below this $21.07 point.

So if the Market Price RAD is $400,000 and you pay $200,000, you will pay the remaining $200,000 at 5.54 per cent interest as a daily fee, which is $30.36 a day. If you pay the full RAD there is no interest (DAP) pay no RAD and you will pay a DAP which is the interest on the full amount: $22,160.

But the way the RAC is calculated, under the lower MPIR next month, the equivalent lump sum will be just under $407,000 - harder still and now more than double her total assets.

0555.00006; Factoring in around a 2% dividend yield, the annual total return is more than 18%.
0555.00019; Luckily, earnings were back up last year and it seems it will continue up this year. Consequently, I am not too worried about the payout ratio as it should land comfortably below 50% on this year's earnings.
0555.00026; An EPS of $20.85 would mean that the company grows earnings a full 18.5% from the 2018 level of $17.59.
0555.00031; Given the conservative payout ratio there is clearly enough money to invest in profitable projects so the natural way to reward shareholders would be to offer decent dividend growth on the back of strong earnings growth. I therefore see no compelling reason for an unusually low hike this year. My prediction is therefore that the company will land somewhere in the middle, i.e. offer a dividend hike in-line with recent years of 10%.

0597.00002; By Karin Matussek and Christoph Rauwald | Sep 24, 2019  (Bloomberg)  -  Germany's embattled car industry suffered a one-two blow after prosecutors charged Volkswagen AG's two top executives with market manipulation in the four-year-old diesel scandal and Daimler AG was fined in a separate probe for rigging vehicles. The charge against VW's leaders was brought by prosecutors in Braunschweig, near the company's Wolfsburg headquarters, alleging that Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess, Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch and former CEO Martin Winterkorn were too slow to inform investors about their diesel findings. Within hours, a separate decision by Stuttgart prosecutors fined Daimler 870 million euros ($957 million) in a probe into their diesel cars.
0597.00007; With their top managers now in the firing line, Volkswagen was dealt a dramatic setback in the scandal that has been haunting the carmaker since September 2015, when it admitted using software in 11 million diesel vehicles to cheat on emissions tests. At the time, Diess had just joined the company. The toll has so far reached 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in fines and other expenses for the firm and the proceedings could drag on during a period when it's facing a shift to electric cars and slower sales in some key markets.
0597.00014; VW shares fell 3% in Frankfurt, while Daimler slumped 1.7%. The Volkswagen market-manipulation probe was prompted by Germany's financial regulator Bafin, which in mid-2016 asked prosecutors to investigate Winterkorn and Diess.
