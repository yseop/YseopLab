0002.00001; September 13, 2019 Congress Speaker's Office Developing Drug Pricing Proposal. A leaked bill summary shows that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is developing her own proposal to address prescription drug prices.
0002.00002; While the Speaker's office disclaimed the leaked version, saying it is out of date, the draft reveals several noteworthy Democratic policy options likely being discussed including Medicare negotiation, capping drug prices at an International Price Index, capping out-of-pocket costs for Part D beneficiaries, and establishing an inflation rebate for drugs whose prices rise too fast.
0002.00003; The challenge for the Speaker's office will be to ultimately write a bill far-reaching enough to satisfy progressives, but not so aggressive that it will lose the support of moderate Democrats. At the same time, Pelosi needs President Trump to play ball on some of her provisions while not losing progressives who may feel that the President's support means the bill does not go far enough.
0002.00004; It will not be an easy needle to thread.
0002.00005; Congress Returned from Recess with a Busy Agenda Energy and Commerce Held Hearing on Maternal Health.
0002.00006; The House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee held a hearing to consider four bills relating to maternal and child health: the Mothers and Offspring Mortality and Morbidity Awareness Act ( R. 1897 ), the Quality Care for Moms and Babies Act ( H.R. 1551 ), the Maternal Care Access and Reducing Emergencies Act ( H.R. 2902 ), and the Healthy MOMMIES Act ( H.R. 2602 ).
0002.00007; The conversation focused primarily on social determinants of health, racial disparities and insurance coverage as drivers of maternal health.
0002.00008; While Democrats on the committee argued for a federal law extending Medicaid for postpartum women, Republicans contended that this should be left to states.
0002.00009; Maternal health has been an issue of growing concern among policymakers.
0002.00010; The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has held a series of roundtables with experts to develop measures aimed at maternal health and recently awarded $9 million to three states to develop new models to improve obstetric care in rural communities.

0002.00012; Small Business Committee Held Hearing on Prior Authorization Impact.
0002.00013; The House Committee on Small Business held a hearing to examine how utilization management programs, particularly prior authorization, affect small medical practitioners in a variety of settings.
0002.00014; The conversation focused primarily on the administrative burdens and delayed care associated with prior authorization, which has come under fire from the medical community.
0002.00015; There was a broad consensus among members of the committee that the current prior authorization system is flawed and needs updating.
0002.00016; Read our full summary of the hearing here . Senate Canceled Markup of Labor-HHS Budget.
0002.00017; The Senate Appropriations Health Subcommittee abruptly canceled its markup of the fiscal year 2020 spending package for the departments of Labor, HHS and Education, which was scheduled for September 10.
0002.00018; The move was the result of a dispute over a proposed Democratic-backed amendment to block the Administration's recent rule preventing health care providers who receive Title X family planning grants from performing abortions or referring patients to abortion services. Republicans accused Democrats of injecting politics into what they believe should be a clean appropriations bill consistent with a recently struck budget compromise.
0002.00019; Democrats leveled similar charges against Republicans who sought to include money to fund a border wall.
0002.00020; The markup has not been rescheduled, though the committee announced on September 12 that the bill has a cap of $187.7 billion, a one percent increase over last year, and the provision that funds the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is set at $23.1 billion.
0002.00021; The cap was passed on a party line vote with no Democratic support, suggesting that passing the legislation needed to fund the government before the September 30 deadline may be a challenge.
0002.00022; Administration Administration Considers Ban on Flavored E-Cigarettes. Following reports that hundreds of people have been sickened and at least six have died from an unknown vaping-related illness, the Trump Administration announced that it is considering a ban on all flavored e-cigarettes. The FDA is working on guidance that would prohibit all non-tobacco flavored e-cigarettes from being sold and require tobacco flavored vaping products to file for FDA approval by May 2020.
0002.00023; The announcement comes amid mounting pressure from parents, health officials and members of Congress for the government to address the epidemic of e-cigarette use among teens and young adults.
0002.00024; A handful of states, including New York, Massachusetts and California, are considering similar measures, and Michigan recently became the first state to ban the sale of flavored e-cigarettes.
0002.00025; It is not clear if or how the Administration plans to address non-tobacco related vaping products like those containing CBD or THC.
0002.00026; CMS Released Final Rule to Revoke/Deny Provider Enrollment in Medicare and Medicaid. Last week, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a final rule that gives the agency authority to revoke or deny provider enrollment in Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) under certain circumstances.
0002.00027; In a press release , CMS indicated that they are finalizing the rule to address various program integrity issues and vulnerabilities.
0002.00028; The final rule requires Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP providers to disclose any current or previous affiliation with a provider or supplier that has uncollected debt, has been or is subject to a payment suspension under a federal health care program, has been excluded from Medicare, Medicaid or CHIP, or has had its Medicare, Medicaid or CHIP billing privileges denied or revoked.
0002.00029; The Secretary of HHS may deny enrollment based on such affiliation if he or she determines that it poses an undue risk of fraud, waste or abuse. CMS estimates that the new authority will lead to approximately 2,600 new revocations per year, resulting in a 10-year savings of $4.16 billion.
0002.00030; Courts Oral Arguments Scheduled in Work Requirement Appeal. On October 11, 2019, the US Court of Appeals for the D.C.
0002.00031; Circuit will hear arguments in the case to decide whether CMS overstepped its authority when it approved 1115 waivers allowing Arkansas and Kentucky to establish Medicaid work requirements.
0002.00032; In March, a federal district judge ruled that both waivers were invalid because they did not promote Medicaid's central purpose of providing health coverage. Democratic presidents appointed two of the judges scheduled to hear the appeal, and many legal observers anticipate that they will side with the lower court. If so, it is likely that CMS and the states will appeal to the US Supreme Court next year.
0002.00033; Plaintiffs Filed Opening Briefs in Risk Corridors Case.
0002.00034; Several issuers have filed opening briefs in a US Supreme Court case claiming the federal government owes approximately $12 billion from risk corridor program required by the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
0002.00035; Under the program, which was designed to encourage carrier participation in the new ACA markets, issuers who earned at least three percent less than expected were to be reimbursed by the government. However, Congress changed the policy in 2014 by attaching a rider to the HHS appropriations bill that required the program to be budget neutral.
0002.00036; As a result, HHS was never able to collect enough money to fully repay the issuers over the course of the three-year program.
0002.00037; The central question before the Court is whether the government can rely on a rider to an appropriations bill to repeal a statutory payment obligation. The Department of Justice is set to file its opening brief on October 21, 2019.

0003.00001; September 13, 2019  Menendez, Senate Democrats Call on the Trump Administration to Help Combat Devastating Fires in Brazilian Amazon WASHINGTON  -  As the Brazilian Amazon continues to be ravaged by tens of thousands of fires, U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today led a group of his Senate Democratic colleagues in calling on the Trump Administration to intensify U.S. support and diplomatic engagement with Brazil to better address the environmental crisis.
0003.00002; In two separate letters, Democratic Senators outlined the urgency for the United States to do more to help combat the fires and protect the Amazon, a natural resource critical to the health and sustainability of the global environment.
0003.00003; In a letter addressed to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, USAID Administrator Mark Green, and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, Senator Menendez and a group of 13 senators urged the Trump Administration to immediately provide financial and technical assistance to the Brazilian government, local authorities and non-governmental actors working to fight the fires. Similarly, the senators identified multiple foreign assistance programs funded by Congress that USAID, the Treasury Department, and the U.S. Forest Service could utilize to re-direct millions of dollars in aid to further support forest preservation efforts and emergency conversation programs. While the Brazilian government is ultimately responsible for the stewardship and conservation management of its territory, the Brazilian Amazon is widely regarded as a natural resource whose viability is critical to the health and sustainability of the global environment, wrote the Senators.
0003.00004; We need to demonstrate to President [Jair] Bolsonaro that he cannot credibly claim that his government lacks the resources to confront this crisis, adding their concerns about the Brazilian President's misguided anti-conservation policies, his lack of urgency in addressing the environmental disaster, and his hostility towards the rights of indigenous peoples.
0003.00005; Joining Menendez in sending the letter to the three Cabinet members were Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and Kamala Harris (D-Calif).
0003.00006; In a separate letter to the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Brazil, Senator Menendez and a group of 12 Democratic Senators also called on the U.S. diplomats in Brazil to intensify engagement with the Bolsonaro government to combat the fires and improve Amazon stewardship.
0003.00007; [President Bolsonaro's] reaction to this growing environmental crisis fits the pattern of malign neglect and exploitation of the Amazon that is threatening the health and safety of an increasing number of Brazilian citizens -- and the global population  -  from a climate and air quality standpoint, wrote the Senators. We encourage you to stand with the majority of Brazilians who strongly favor protecting the Amazon and disapprove of President Bolsonaro's irresponsible mismanagement of Brazil's unique and ecologically critical natural resources.
0003.00008; Joining Menendez in sending the letter to Charge d'Affairs William Popp were Senators Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and Kamala Harris (D-Calif). A copy of both letters can be found below.
0003.00009; Dear Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary Perdue, and Administrator Green:  We are writing to urge immediate financial and technical assistance to combat the tens of thousands of fires burning across Brazil, including in the Brazilian Amazon.
0003.00010; Scientists at Brazil's National Institute of Amazonian Research have determined that rampant deforestation, which has increased exponentially in 2019, has pushed the Amazon to an ecological tipping point, and the fires currently burning across the Amazon are exacerbating this situation.
0003.00011; Further, President Jair Bolsonaro's hostility to indigenous peoples' land rights and existing Brazilian conservation law is intensifying the crisis.
0003.00012; Should President Bolsonaro accept the G-7's offers to aid Brazil during this crisis, the U.S. must engage constructively with other G-7 members towards working with Brazil to halt and reverse the alarming rate of deforestation in the Amazon.
0003.00013; While the Brazilian government is ultimately responsible for the stewardship and conservation management of its territory, the Brazilian Amazon, is widely regarded as a natural resource whose viability is critical to the health and sustainability of the global environment.
0003.00014; For that reason, the U.S., and many other foreign governments have for decades contributed millions of dollars to efforts to preserve and protect the Amazon. This investment and our historical leadership on global conservation warrant the U.S. to offer both emergency assistance to efforts on the ground to extinguish and control the fires as well as technical assistance to improve wildfire, forestry, agricultural, and watershed management capacities of national and subnational authorities in Brazil responding to the crisis. President Bolsonaro is largely dismissive of the severity of the fires.
0003.00015; He has claimed that Brazil does not have the resources to combat the fires, and without evidence, accuses his critics of setting the fires. Despite the President's claims, we urge USAID, the Treasury Department, and the U.S. Forest Service to respond by offering assistance to the Brazilian government, local authorities and non-governmental actors working to fight the fires.
0003.00016; We also strongly encourage you to exercise United States leadership through multilateral organizations like the Global Environmental Facility, the World Bank, and the Green Climate Fund to mobilize funds towards addressing the Amazon crisis.
0003.00017; The Congress has programmed $11 million in the current fiscal year's appropriations legislation for bilateral environmental cooperation with Brazil.
0003.00018; These funds should be immediately re-directed to aid in forest preservation efforts and emergency conservation programs.
0003.00019; Additionally, the Congress provided $125 million in the current fiscal year for sustainable landscapes programming to prevent forest loss.
0003.00020; Unobligated balances in this account should be directed, to the extent practical, to help Brazil cooperatively combat the drivers of wildfires in the Amazon and other fire-affected regions.
0003.00021; We need to demonstrate to President Bolsonaro that he cannot credibly claim that his government lacks the resources to confront this crisis. Thank you for your attention to this matter and for taking our concerns seriously as you engage with the Brazilian government on this localized environmental crisis with serious global consequences. We look forward to your response.
0003.00022; Sincerely,  -30-  Dear Mr. Popp:  We are writing to urge your immediate engagement with the Brazilian government on supporting improvements to stewardship efforts of the Amazon Rainforest and to assist with urgent efforts to combat the tens of thousands of fires burning across the Brazilian Amazon.
0003.00023; The Brazilian Amazon rainforest is experiencing unprecedented stress and degradation, putting this unique and critically important natural ecosystem at risk of undergoing drastic changes that would not only transform the ecological characteristics of the region, but threaten our entire global environment. According to the Brazilian Space Agency, as of June this year, clearcutting in the Amazon has increased by 88 percent as compared to June 2018 representing a loss of more than 1,760 square miles of rainforest in an 11-month period.
0003.00024; Adding to the crisis are more than 74,000 fires currently burning across the Brazilian Amazon that are harming air quality, darkening daytime skies in Sa Paolo, and releasing more than 200 million tons of CO2 into the atmosphere.
0003.00025; By all accounts, President Jair Bolsonaro is dismissing the severity of the fires exacerbating the Amazon crisis neglecting to take action to quell the fires or enforce Brazil's conservation laws and has gone so far as to blame his critics, without any evidence, for setting the fires.
0003.00026; This reaction to this growing environmental crisis fits the pattern of malign neglect and exploitation of the Amazon that is threatening the health and safety of an increasing number of Brazilian citizens -- and the global population from a climate and air quality standpoint.
0003.00027; We encourage you to stand with the majority of Brazilians who strongly favor protecting the Amazon and disapprove of President Bolsonaro's irresponsible mismanagement of Brazil's unique and ecologically critical natural resources.
0003.00028; While the stewardship and conservation management of the Brazilian Amazon is the responsibility of the Brazilian government, the Amazon is widely regarded as a natural resource critical to the health and sustainability of the global environment.
0003.00029; For that reason, the U.S., and many other foreign governments have for decades contributed millions of dollars to efforts to preserve and protect the Amazon. This investment and the United States historical leadership on global conservation make the need for you to elevate U.S. engagement on Amazon conservation a priority during this crisis.
0003.00030; We are urging you to:  - Encourage Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro to enforce Brazil's rainforest conservation laws  - Publicly condemn President Bolsonaro's irresponsible policies contributing to the mismanagement and unsustainable exploitation of the Amazon  - Reinforce U.S. support for the important role civil society is playing to keep the public informed about the realities of President Bolsonaro's misguided anti-conservation policies and  - Offer support for efforts to combat the fires that are exacerbating Brazil's environmental crisis.
0003.00031; We would appreciate an immediate update on all engagements with the Bolsonaro government on Amazon stewardship, and expect a substantive response to this request as soon as practicable.
0003.00032; Thank you for your service and attention to this matter and for taking our concerns seriously as you engage with the Brazilian government. We look forward to your response. Sincerely,  ###
0004.00001; What Is The Most Pressing Issue Facing Canadians This Election?
0004.00002; To answer the question, we asked female MPs.
0004.00003; There was a surprising consensus.
0004.00004; by Chatelaine  (Left) Irene Mathyssen, NDP, (Ont., London - Fanshawe) and (right) Jane Philpott, Independent (Ont., Markham - Stouffville).
0004.00005; Consensus, in the realm of politics, is a rare thing.
0004.00006; But when it comes to what members of Parliament think is the biggest issue facing this country, most MPs agree on one daunting issue. This summer, as the campaign for the federal election began to heat up, Chatelaine contacted every woman serving in the 42nd Parliament. We held round-table discussions, conducted one-on-one interviews and emailed them slightly nosy questionnaires - and of the 91 female MPs who had a seat in government, we talked to 86 of them.
0004.00007; When we asked many of them what they thought the biggest issue was, a clear majority - 76 percent - cited the climate crisis. The next most frequent answer was the cost of living and growing inequality at 12 percent, and the rise of populism at 5 percent.
0004.00008; Other issues included electoral reform, the opioid crisis, energy production, the economy, civic engagement and access to broadband internet.
0004.00009; Here's what some of them had to say:  Protecting our environment is the issue of our century.
0004.00010; If we don't successfully stop the harmful effects of climate change and make significant progress in reducing plastic and other harmful wastes, we will have failed our children and our children's children.
0004.00011; The good news is that we can innovate and develop the technology that will help us save our planet as long as everyone in our society does their part. - Brenda Shanahan, Liberal (Que., Châteauguay - Lacolle)  If we want a future, we have to completely change the way that we are doing things and it's not just a question of the environment but also consumption. We are buying too many things that we don't need.
0004.00012; It has to be thought of holistically - it's not just a question of our like, emissions. The issue is much larger.
0004.00013; - Christine Moore, NDP (Que., Abitibi - Témiscamingue)  We have some very hard work to do - the climate crisis being the top issue.
0004.00014; If we don't stop arguing with one another and figure out how to work together to get things done, then the country and the planet will suffer.
0004.00015; - Jane Philpott, Independent (Ont., Markham - Stouffville)  It's climate change.
0004.00016; And I don't say that lightly.
0004.00017; Let's face it, they can jump up and down all they want about the economy but there is no economy if there is no environmental security. - Irene Mathyssen, NDP, (Ont., London - Fanshawe)  Every day people are struggling to pay their bills, afford medication, find affordable housing, send their kids to school, take care of ageing parents - all while wages are stagnant and services are being slashed We can't even get a small increase to minimum wage and corporations are getting everything they want: tax evasion, stock option loopholes, writing legislation to get them off the hook.
0004.00018; The system is broken and people who are struggling the most are bearing all of the weight.
0004.00019; It's deeply unfair and not what most Canadians want our country to be. - Tracey Ramsey, NDP (Ont., Essex)  (Letf) Kellie Leitch, Conservative, (Ont., Simcoe - Grey), (top right) Michelle Rempel, Conservative (Alta., Calgary Nose Hill) and (bottom right) Shannon Stubbs, Conservative (Alta., Lakeland).
0004.00020; I believe health care is the most pressing issue facing our country.
0004.00021; Particularly the inability of the health care system to change.
0004.00022; We need an open and healthy debate in this country about our health care system.
0004.00023; Today, politicians get to say when and where you get your care, but they are not accountable to deliver that healthcare in a timely manner.
0004.00024; Canadians are ready to have a real discussion about health care that goes beyond the tired, typical 'we need more money' argument. It is time to talk about innovation and doing things differently. Let's talk about accountability.
0004.00025; Let's talk about investing in children and taking a longer-range vision of health. - Kellie Leitch, Conservative, (Ont., Simcoe - Grey)  One of the most pressing public policy and economic issues facing Canada is the future of responsible resource development and energy development.
0004.00026; As a sector, oil and gas is the number one private sector in the Canadian economy and it is Canada's number one export. So it literally is a major source of capital in the economy.
0004.00027; There are people working in jobs and small businesses in communities right across the Canada who right now don't think their jobs are dependent on oil and gas, because they're in a restaurant or in a hotel or in a clothing shop or in a bar or in an equipment store.
0004.00028; They don't think their jobs are dependent on oil and gas but it is.
0004.00029; If the energy sector in Canada continues down this steep decline that's been caused by legislation over the last three or four years, it will get so much worse for Canadians in terms of jobs and also in terms of revenue across all three levels of government which provide the social services and the public programs that Canadians deserve and expect.
0004.00030; - Shannon Stubbs, Conservative (Alta., Lakeland)  In my riding right now, there is only one issue and it is the energy sector and jobs. That is it.
0004.00031; - Michelle Rempel, Conservative (Alta., Calgary Nose Hill)  We must change the mindset so that politics isn't a bad word, but instead is about shaping the future direction of the nation and is the responsibility of every citizen in our democracy. Democracy only works when we are all willing and able to communicate our ideas and vision for what we want for our country. Our democracy is only as strong as the participation and engagement of our citizens.
0004.00032; Our challenge is to regain the trust of Canadians in the federal government's ability to govern and shape the future direction of the nation in the way that Canadians have expressed.
0004.00033; It is about inspiring Canadians to have the courage to have conversations about politics, and to know that together we all can truly make the Canada of tomorrow better than today.
0004.00034; - Leona Alleslev, Conservative (Ont., Aurora - Oak Ridges - Richmond Hill)  Celina Caesar-Chavannes, Independent (Ont., Whitby)  One of the most pressing issues in this country, is the rise of populism the ability for people to say whatever they want whenever they want.
0004.00035; And it's not being helped by certain governments Bill 21 in Quebec is a terrible piece of legislation that feeds into a narrative that certain people don't belong. And, the argument is that they're trying to make everyone uniform.
0004.00036; Well, at what point does that end? You can remove religious paraphernalia, but at what point do we say that we can't be uniform?
0004.00037; Because I cannot change my skin colour and I cannot change my gender - and at some point in the history of this country, because of my gender and because of my skin colour, I would not have had rights.
0004.00038; We are on a very slippery slope when we allow the sentiments of the yellow-vesters and others to feed into our national discourse around our democracy.
0004.00039; It is wrong, it is a very, very slippery slope, and we need all hands on deck to fight back against what is happening to people in our country.

0006.00001; Business Tips  September 13, 2019  By Rachel C  Nothing is certain in life but death and taxes, right?
0006.00002; Every small business owner looks for ways to write off deductions to get a tax break so that they can have more money to invest in their business. Deductions can help reduce your tax bill, but they require two things: knowing what deductions are available and keeping good records. Always keep receipts so that your end of year and tax season is smooth sailing.
0006.00003; 1. Employee salaries and contract labor wages You can deduct any salaries, bonuses, or wages that you pay to employees.
0006.00004; You can also deduct the costs of employee benefits like health insurance premiums and per diems, as well as any tools that you use to pay your employees, such as payroll software. If you use contractors or freelancers in your business instead of or in addition to employees, you can deduct the costs of their services.
0006.00005; If any contractor makes over $600 per year, be sure to issue them a Form 1099-MISC come tax time.
0006.00006; 2. Business travel If you or your employees frequently travel for business purposes, you can deduct these costs.
0006.00007; There are some requirements, however. These expenses can include: airfare, train fare, tolls, parking, hotel stays, taxis or Lyft, and mileage (the standard mileage rate is currently 58 cents per mile in 2019). It is important that you meet the IRS requirements before deducting travel expenses.

0007.00001; This content is from: Portfolio  Apollo's Josh Harris Talks Private Markets at Delivering Alpha  The Apollo co-founder suggests that shareholders of private equity firms are finally starting to recognize the value of their business models.
0007.00002; By  Joshua Harris (Heidi Gutman/CNBC)  Sponsored  II Live: What's Driving Demand for ESG Strategies?
0007.00003; As capital floods private markets, Apollo Global Management co-founder Joshua Harris believes investors are finally taking steps toward properly valuing publicly-traded private equity firms. It's getting there, he said Thursday on stage at the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha conference at The Pierre hotel in New York.
0007.00004; Harris said hedge fund shareholders of private equity firms are being replaced by more general investors like index and mutual funds, a shift that accelerated as firms converted to so-called C-corporations.
0007.00005; Shares of Apollo  -  which earlier this month completed its conversion to a corporation from a publicly traded partnership  -  have climbed about 67 percent this year. The private equity firm has been growing through diversification over the past decade, with a total $312 billion under management at the end of June, including credit and real assets.
0007.00006; Harris said that companies with stories that can't be simply explained to public market investors may have more success seeking capital in private markets.
0007.00007; Buyout firms including Apollo, which likes complexity, are overseeing an expanding pool of workers at the companies they own. If you don't fit the box in public markets, you can't raise money, said Harris. We're getting to be pretty large as an industry.
0007.00008; Private equity has been popular with institutional investors. Our private equity business, net of all cost, is our top performer, said Ashbel Williams, executive director and chief investment officer of Florida State Board of Administration, during an earlier discussion on stage at the Delivering Alpha event. Williams, who oversees more than $150 billion of assets, including those under The Florida Retirement System Pension Plan, said its private equity assets include venture capital.
0007.00009; [II Deep Dive: When Buyout Firms Step in, Watch Out]  Companies are finding plenty of capital in private markets, turning to alternative asset managers for both equity and loans.
0007.00010; We have to recognize that a lot of growth is happening in our private markets, said Jay Clayton, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, while on stage earlier on Thursday at the Delivering Alpha conference.
0007.00011; He said they are no doubt riskier than public markets, but that management teams can apply similar rigor in private markets.
0007.00012; There are lots of people operating in the private markets who are very good at understanding how companies perform and delivering performance, Clayton said. Are the rules not as rigorous as the public markets? Of course not.

0010.00001; 20190924signed a pledge on August 16 with its third-party sellers that it would give a 30-day suspension notice before permanently removing them from the platform. Many sellers and consultants thought that policy would protect them.
0010.00002; But a month after it went into effect, third-party sellers told Business Insider that they are still being suspended from the platform without notice.
0010.00003; It's one of the biggest gripes Amazon sellers have with the e-commerce giant. . Amazon's third-party merchants power some 58% of the e-commerce giant's sales. But those sellers aren't without their gripes  -  and one of the biggest complaints centers around just how easy it is to be wiped off the platform without any warning or explanation.
0010.00004; While Amazon has teams dedicated to seller compliance, many accounts suspensions are the result of algorithmic decisions made by Amazon's internal machine-learning software. This results in some sellers getting booted even if they have done nothing wrong.
0010.00005; Nobody likes that your business just shuts down overnight, Amazon seller and consultant Cynthia Stine told Business Insider. They keep your money, they keep your inventory, and you're looking at a very vaguely worded notification document that doesn't really tell you what they're looking for.
0010.00006; So, as part of a German antitrust settlement, Amazon amended its Business Services Agreement, which all third-party merchants agree to. That new version gives sellers in and out of Germany a 30-day notice before permanently removing them from the platform.
0010.00007; Sellers whose profiles were used for illegal or fraudulent activities, whose products harmed customers, or otherwise materially breached the sellers' agreement could still be removed without that 30-day notice.
0010.00008; Before the new policy went into effect, Amazon said in its seller agreement that it could for any reason at any time by notice remove merchants from the marketplace. That new policy went into effect on August 16 for merchants worldwide.
0010.00009; The policy isn't what sellers or consultants thought it would be When the August 16 policy was enacted, sellers and consultants believed Amazon would give them that 30-day notice when they were suspended.
0010.00010; That's what much of the messaging around the new policy communicated. This is a much-ballyhooed improvement to account suspension and transparency and we're looking under rocks for it, said Chris McCabe, who is the founder of a consultancy called eCommerceChris that helps Amazon sellers whose accounts have been suspended.
0010.00011; The fact that this new policy doesn't protect suspended sellers  -  and only ones headed for permanent removal -  was a surprise to us, McCabe said. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider  The limits of the policy were also news to Jason Boyce, who was a multimillion-dollar seller on Amazon and is now a consultant to Amazon businesses.
0010.00012; When I read the policy change that came shortly after the EU rulings, I thought, 'Thirty days  -  this is a good start,' Boyce told Business Insider.
0010.00013; 'I would prefer 60 or 90 days, but this is a step in the right direction to protect third-party sellers.' To hear now that it had nothing to do with account suspensions, only to do with account cancellations, to me it seems that they only paid the account policy lip service, said Boyce, the founder of Avenue7Media.
0010.00014; An Amazon spokesperson said sellers are incredibly important to Amazon and its customers.
0010.00015; We have tools and services to help them grow their business, as well as policies to ensure they help us delight our customers, the spokesperson said in a statement emailed to Business Insider.
0010.00016; If sellers violate our policies and damage our customer experience, we take swift action in order to protect both customers and other sellers. Ever-changing language Part of the confusion stems from the fact that Amazon frequently changes how it refers to account suspensions or terminations.
0010.00017; Germany's federal competition regulator told news media that the settlement would address the termination and blocking of sellers' accounts.
0010.00018; But those two terms could feasibly refer to permanent or temporary account actions.
0010.00019; Amazon alternatively calls temporary actions suspensions or deactivations.
0010.00020; A permanent account ending may be called blocking.
0010.00021; Read more: Amazon denies a report that it altered its search algorithms to favor its own products  The constantly-shifting terms are baffling to sellers. But this hazy language is not an accident, said McCabe, who worked in Amazon's seller compliance department for five years.
0010.00022; They generally like to keep it vague on purpose because they don't want to be, I guess, pigeonholed. They don't want to be quoted back to themselves, McCabe said. 'Well, you told me this, and that's what I've given you.'
0010.00023; They don't want to be quoted to themselves.
0010.00024; They keep it vague because they want to reserve the right to interpret things as they see fit.
0010.00025; Sellers are still getting removed without 30-day notice The fact that Amazon is not required to give 30-day notice before suspending an account is still widely not known among sellers.
0010.00026; Peter Kearns was a business development manager at Amazon for nearly four years, and now consults suspended Amazon sellers. He told Business Insider that several suspended sellers have contacted him in recent weeks, confused that they didn't receive the 30-day notice before getting booted. Read more: A key metric in FedEx's financial statements underscores why the shipping giant dropped Amazon as a customer  I think that one of the challenges with the new BSA (Business Solutions Agreement), there was a lot of talk when it came out that sellers were going to get a 30-day notice, Kearns said.
0010.00027; That doesn't say that that's what this was going to do.
0010.00028; Amazon warehouse in Brieselang, Germany. Getty  In the UK, Yasmin Calma runs a baby accessory and clothing store called Tiny Alpaca with her partner Kieran Broyd. On September 15, the merchants discovered their account was suspended without any notification.
0010.00029; (As of September 18, they're back on the platform.)
0010.00030; We haven't been given any reasoning  -  no email, no explanation, Calma told Business Insider. They said they had $15,000 of inventory stuck in the Amazon warehouse and couldn't ship it back without losing thousands of dollars. Calma has been monitoring the Amazon Seller Forums, where scores of sellers have posted about their accounts getting suspended without notification, to learn more.
0010.00031; A lot of them believed they would get a 30-day notice, but they were shut down with no notification, Calma said.
0010.00032; They would do whatever Amazon wanted. Amazon sellers are like abused kids. They would do anything to please Papa Amazon.
0010.00033; But we don't get warnings  -  we just get taken down.
0010.00034; Read more:'Amazon is not their friend': Amazon sellers are organizing against the retail giant as the FTC and DOJ continues their anti-trust probe  One US-based seller, who requested anonymity to avoid retaliation from Amazon, was removed from the marketplace after Amazon claimed they were selling items with prescription-level substances in it.
0010.00035; Amazon told the seller to remove that product on August 30.
0010.00036; They removed the inventory from that product, but failed to delete the listing altogether. Less than two weeks later, on September 11, the seller saw one night that their account was suspended.
0010.00037; My stomach totally dropped, the seller told Business Insider.
0010.00038; They thought they would receive a 30-day notification, but did not.
0010.00039; John Zeedick/AP Photos  That seller ultimately got their account reinstated in less than two days, but there was a hit to the seller's bottom line  -  they generate some $2,000 a day in sales.
0010.00040; We're running a business, the seller said.
0010.00041; We have lines of credit that we're paying on top of the product  -  just not a very good situation to find yourself in.
0010.00042; And in India, Amazon seller Chirag Jindal told Business Insider that his account was suspended on September 6.
0010.00043; He received two emails the prior month, which Business Insider viewed, about inaccurately constructed listings, which he corrected.
0010.00044; I didn't get any notification before (I was suspended), Jindal said.
0010.00045; And I think that's the worst thing about suspensions that Amazon does. Read more: US senators wrote a letter to Jeff Bezos expressing 'grave concerns' over 'illegal' and 'deceptive' products sold on Amazon  Five Amazon consultants and lawyers who help sellers with suspended accounts confirmed to Business Insider that recent clients also have not received the 30-day notice Amazon promised. I have not seen the 30-day warning yet, said Stine, who runs a 25-person business out of Dallas focused on reinstating suspended Amazon sellers.
0010.00046; So far as I can tell, there's been no one who has gotten that 30-day message.
0010.00047; 'Good apples' are getting caught up in the crackdown  -  and the economic consequences can be serious While they may be thought of as small businesses, some of these marketplace sellers are massive. Around 50,000 third-party Amazon sellers each generated more than $500,000 in sales last year.
0010.00048; So, when they're removed from the marketplace platform, they risk losing their entire livelihood.
0010.00049; Scott Needham, CTO of Amazon marketplace seller Logan, Utah-based BuyBoxer, previously told Business Insider that, when his store was suspended for seven days, 100 employees were sent home for a full week.
0010.00050; (This shutdown happened prior to the August 16 policy change.)
0010.00051; I just know that like every seller out there has feared the policy enforcement out there, Needham said.
0010.00052; Amazon says that they're going after the bad actors.
0010.00053; I completely support and I want them to do that, but I can name dozens of sellers that have tried to do things in good faith and they still come across this.
0010.00054; AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File  Plenty of good apples can get caught in Amazon's machine learning-based process of suspending sellers, Kearns said.
0010.00055; Lots of suspensions result from seller accounts triggering Amazon's algorithm to catch bad actors in the marketplace, and that means sellers who haven't made a mistake can sometimes end up suspended.
0010.00056; See also: Apply here to attend IGNITION: Transportation, an event focused on the future of transportation, in San Francisco on October 22. An Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider that the company has employees who monitor seller activity and take action when appropriate.
0010.00057; We provide sellers with clear guidance about what policy they violated, and have an appeals process where sellers can explain how they will prevent the violation from happening in the future or let us know if they believe they were compliant, the spokesperson added. Our global team is available 24/7 to support sellers via email, phone, and chat in more than 15 languages.
0010.00058; If a seller has a question about their account, we encourage them to contact us directly and we will investigate and take appropriate action.
0010.00059; REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne  Stine said many of her clients who were suspended in the past week made a mistake in creating a variation on their product page.
0010.00060; An Amazon merchant who is selling, say, several different colors of water bottles may place a different size or type of bottle in the same listing.
0010.00061; This is beneficial for the seller if that original water bottle has a high ranking and review, but it's not allowed under Amazon's seller agreement.
0010.00062; And some sellers take it too far, knowingly or not, and pack hundreds of variations in one listing.
0010.00063; Ultimately, they risk suspension from Amazon.
0010.00064; They are banning people for very minor offenses made out of ignorance, Stine said.
0010.00065; That's why this has been so heartbreaking. Still, the speedy banning is in line with Amazon's ethos of customer obsession. If a third-party seller is potentially causing a bad experience for customers, the e-commerce giant won't hesitate to eliminate them.
0010.00066; Amazon at its core is obsessed with creating a great customer experience, Kearns said.
0010.00067; If they think a seller is creating a negative customer experience, they'd rather suspend and protect that customer experience rather than allow a potential bad apple. Are you an Amazon seller?

0011.00002; In summation:  two laws were approved two laws remain under discussion by the Macau legislature and three sector newcomers entered the market, including an innovative entity relating to financial assets transactions.
0011.00003; Legislative developments  In 2018 and 2019 the legislature approved the following laws to reinforce Macau's economic stability and international  fiscal cooperation:  Law 4/2018 of 12 March 2018 (Amendment to Law 9/2012  -  Deposit Guarantee Scheme)  -  which simplifies the calculation of compensation due to depositors by switching from the 'full netting' to the 'gross payout' approach and Law 15/2018 of 27 December 2018 (Abolishment of the Offshore Regime)  -  which responds to the possibility of being included in the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions in tax matters. All authorisations for offshore companies will expire on 1 January 2021 (for further details please see Macau Sino-Portuguese offshore activities).
0011.00004; Exciting news  Among the newcomers, one stands out: financial institution Chongwa (Macao) Financial Asset Exchange Co Ltd(MOX), which is reputed to be the first entity authorised in Macau to perform debt securities registration, custody, settlement and clearing services. The debut financial products listed by MOX were a Hong Kong dollar-denominated bond of Luso International Banking Limited and a Macanese pataca-denominated bond of Bank of China Limited, Macau Branch.
0011.00005; Going forward  With Macau's government and legislature growing more resolute, further diversification and progress in the banking and financial sector are anticipated in 2019 and 2020.
0011.00006; Additional measures are expected to develop the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, particularly to overcome the challenges presented by today's cross border financial activities.

0012.00001; Sean Williams The Motley Fool  Published 11:41 AM EDT Sep 12, 2019  You could rightly say that this has been an interesting year for investors. On the surface, you'd probably think the broader market would be struggling.
0012.00002; There are concerns about an escalating trade war with China, the yield curve has inverted for the first time since 2007, and just last week, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index fell to 49.1, signaling a contraction in manufacturing activity for the first time in three years.
0012.00003; Yet the broad-based S&P 500 is having an incredibly strong year, with a year-to-date gain of 18.8% through this past weekend. Despite the at-times sensationalist headlines, the S&P 500 ended the week a mere 47 points away from hitting an all-time closing high.
0012.00004; Court: Amazon owes South Carolina millions in sales taxes  Analysis: Are social media users abandoning Facebook and Instagram?
0012.00005; Although much of the talk of late has been about the yield curve inversion and the likelihood of a recession over the next 12 to 18 months  -  every recession over the past 50 years has been preceded by a yield-curve inversion, though not every yield-curve inversion guarantees there will be a recession  -  I'm having different thoughts. I believe the stock market is in prime position to thrive, if not soar to new highs, and it has an odd reason to thank for its catalyst: fear. First off, you have to understand that the stock market and the U.S. economy aren't tied at the hip.
0012.00006; What's good for the economy isn't always good for stocks, and vice versa.
0012.00007; For example, on numerous occasions over the past year, we've witnessed the market sell off on news of stronger-than-expected jobs growth. The reason is that investors want the Federal Reserve to continue lowering the federal funds rate, which it's less likely to do if economic growth, including jobs growth, remains robust. So there has been this bifurcation between economic news and stock market performance for some time now.
0012.00008; This bifurcation is important to note, because it demonstrates that consumer and investor fear isn't necessarily a precursor to a poor-performing market. Nissan Rogue under investigation: Claims of emergency brakes turning on for no reason  It's the bond market, however, where fear will exert its greatest influence and help to push stocks to new heights.
0012.00009; With Wall Street clearly worried about trade war escalation between the two largest countries in the world by gross domestic product (GDP), investors have been opting to buy U.S. Treasury bonds as a safe-haven investment.
0012.00010; The thing is, bond prices and bond yields have an inverse relationship, meaning that as more investor money flows into bonds, yields decline. Recently, the 10-year and 30-year Treasury notes hit respective three-year and all-time lows of below 1.5% and 2%.
0012.00011; Now, here's where things get interesting.
0012.00012; Although U.S. bond yields are still light-years higher than the $17 trillion and counting in global government debt that's now sporting a negative yield (ahem, Japan and most of Europe), most U.S. bonds are generating negative realized yields once you factor in the inflation rate of 1.8% over the trailing 12-month period. Essentially, investors aren't making any real money by diving into bonds as a safe-haven investment.
0012.00013; In my opinion, this is likely to cause a knee-jerk effect that shifts investments back out of bonds and into safe-haven stocks.
0012.00014; By safe-haven stocks, I'm talking about low-volatility, generally moderate- to high-yielding time-tested businesses. Right now, there are few means of generating inflation-topping income beyond equities, which makes stocks a logical choice, by default, to benefit.
0012.00015; There's a pattern here: Fear induces a minor market sell-off, investors flock to bonds, and yields plummet. Then, investors scurry back to stocks, sending them to new highs.
0012.00016; This could occur in a rinse-and-repeat pattern for some time.
0012.00017; We're already seeing evidence of this effect in action Believe it or not, I'd contend that we're already seeing evidence of fear driving safe-haven stocks and the broader market higher.
0012.00018; Remember, most safe-haven stocks have established business models and are large-cap or mega-cap stocks, thereby giving them a lot of influence over the S&P 500.
0012.00019; One perfect example would be telecom and streaming-content giant AT&T.
0012.00020; As a shareholder in AT&T, I can attest that its operating results have been OK, but nothing special in 2019, with wireless strength being offset by cord-cutting. Yet the year-to-date return for AT&T is nearly 29%, not including dividend income, through this past weekend.
0012.00021; Among mega-cap stocks, few if any can beat AT&T's 5.7% dividend yield, which is more than triple the inflation rate in the United States.
0012.00022; With substantially lower volatility than the S&P 500 and guaranteed income  -  AT&T is a Dividend Aristocrat that has raised its payout for 35 consecutive years  -  it has been a prime beneficiary of plunging bond yields.
0012.00023; Another beneficiary of market fear has been beverage giant Coca-Cola.
0012.00024; Coca-Cola has benefited from exceptionally strong organic sales growth, driven mostly by improved consumer demand, but is most coveted by investors for its branding power and income potential.
0012.00025; Coca-Cola's 2.9% yield is more than a full percentage point higher than the trailing 12-month inflation rate, and its beta of 0.31 shows that its stock is only about 31% as volatile as the S&P 500.
0012.00026; It's a perfect safe-haven income stock.
0012.00027; Then there's consumer products company Procter & Gamble, which has tacked on just shy of 34% this year, not including dividends.
0012.00028; Like Coca-Cola, this gain came after Procter & Gamble's stock was virtually flat from 2013 to 2018.
0012.00029; However, plunging global bond yields have created quite the demand for large-scale, brand-name businesses that pay a hearty dividend.
0012.00030; Procter & Gamble's yield of 2.4% may be lower than Coca-Cola's or AT&T's, but it has increased its payout for an impressive 63 straight years.
0012.00031; The idea might sound ridiculous, but fear could very well lead the stock market to new highs.

0013.00001; Sep 19, 2019  Islamabad (Pakistan) Sept 19: Within two days of its launch, the mobile app for simplified return has received 98 salary returns digitally and thousands of downloads of the app, indicating its success according to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
0013.00002; The app Tax Asaan has been operational since Monday (Sept 16) with its scope limited to the salary income of an individual.
0013.00003; Speaking to Dawn on Wednesday, FBR chairman Shabbar Zaidi said the tax collection body had updated the app for income tax return filing for salaried persons only, claiming it would greatly assist taxpayers in the filing of their returns without any trouble.
0013.00004; We encourage all taxpayers to submit their returns on time, he said.
0013.00005; The chairman urged the taxpayers to use the app and make the country stronger by paying their due taxes.
0013.00006; He said even though the app was on a trial basis but there had been an encouraging response.
0013.00007; Till Wednesday, on Google's official Android operating system there were over 20,000 downloads of the app and 6,000 plus downloads on Apple's iOS mobile operating system by different users.
0013.00008; In terms of submission of salary return, the data showed as many as 1,753 draft returns and 98 returns had been submitted online so far through the app which the chairman said was reflective of its success.
0013.00009; The FBR has also uploaded the new electronic form of return for individuals, salaried individuals and association of persons for the tax year 2019 on the FBR website after making necessary amendments.
0013.00010; The deadline for the submission of returns has been set for Sept 30.
0013.00011; However, a senior tax official told Dawn that the existing app only caters to the salary income with few more variations.
0013.00012; There is also no concept of creating new wealth statement through this app.
0013.00013; There were other deficiencies in the app such as that it will not calculate the rental, business and property incomes of salaried individuals if they have any.
0013.00014; To overcome these deficiencies, the tax official said the FBR would launch a second version of the app in a few days which would include all these incomes generated other than salaries by an individual.
0013.00015; Similarly, the wealth statement will also be made part of the new app.
0013.00016; We will formally launch a new app in the next two to three days, the official said.
0013.00017; However, he did not disclose whether the app will also support key tools like income tax calculator, or any other tools to facilitate taxpayers in e-filing of the tax return.
0013.00018; No online tutorial is available to guide filers to use the app.

0014.00001; Osisko shares tumble after it proposes all-shares Barkerville Gold takeover CanadianInvestor  Share this article  MONTREAL  -  Shares in Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd. fell by almost 10 per cent Monday after it announced a deal to buy the shares of Barkerville Gold Mines Ltd. it doesn't already own.
0014.00002; Osisko, which has a 32.6 per cent stake in Barkerville, says the deal will give it a larger role in advancing and developing Barkerville's Cariboo gold project in British Columbia.
0014.00003; The Montreal-based mining company also announced it was creating the North Spirit Discovery Group to privatize and surface value in resource development projects.
0014.00004; Osisko shares slipped to as little as $14.67 from Friday's close of $16.26 after it announced it would issue 0.0357 of a common share of Osisko for each Barkerville share.
0014.00005; Barkerville shares rose by as much as 21.7 per cent to 56 cents before drifting lower.
0014.00006; Osisko says the ratio implies a value of 58 cents per Barkerville share, representing a 44 per cent premium based on both companies' trailing 20-day volume weighted average price, thus valuing Barkerville at $338 million.
0014.00007; Analyst Andrew Kaip of BMO Capital Markets says the deal is accretive but it increases risk by adding a project developer role for Osisko.
0014.00008; Positively, management reiterated (Osisko) will remain a royalty/streaming company but, in our view, the move may not resonate with some investors, as it adds risk and uncertainty to what is supposed to be a safe business model, he wrote.
0014.00009; The transaction if completed would result in Barkerville shareholders holding about nine per cent of Osisko's equity.

0015.00001; China's Mengniu to buy baby formula maker Bellamy's for $1 billion CNN Wire  One of China's biggest dairy companies is gearing up for a massive takeover of an Australian baby formula maker.
0015.00002; Mengniu Dairy has offered 1.5 billion Australian dollars ($1 billion) to buy infant formula maker Bellamy's Australia, the companies said Monday.
0015.00003; Bellamy's said its board had unanimously recommended shareholders vote to accept the all-cash bid, which represented a 59% premium to the company's closing price on Friday. The deal is still subject to approval from Australian regulators.
0015.00004; Shares in Mengniu slumped 2.8% in Hong Kong on Monday, dragging down the broader Hang Seng Index, which was down about 1%.
0015.00005; Shares in Bellamy's soared 55% in Sydney.
0015.00006; Mengniu is an ideal partner for our business. It offers a strong platform for distribution and success in China, and a foundation for growth in the organic dairy and food industry in Australia, Andrew Cohen, Bellamy's CEO, said in a press release.
0015.00007; Bellamy's brand position and supply chain are critical to Mengniu, said Jeffrey Minfang Lu, Mengniu's CEO, adding that the Chinese company wants to grow Bellamy's sales in Australia and the broader Asia Pacific region. Earlier this year, China's top economic planning body said it wants domestic production of baby formula to be above 60% within three years. Domestic infant and toddler milk formula accounted for about 44% of the market in 2018, according to data analytics company Nielsen.
0015.00008; China's National Development and Reform Commission also said the country will improve the quality of infant formula to boost consumer confidence, state-run news agency Xinhua reported in June.
0015.00009; Infant formula has been a source of controversy in China in the past.
0015.00010; In 2008, tainted milk in China killed at least six babies and sickened about 300,000 others. Raw milk used to produce powdered baby formula had been watered down and the chemical melamine was added to fool quality checks.
0015.00011; More than a decade later, some Chinese parents are still wary of local dairy brands.
0015.00012; The global baby food and infant formula market was worth $52.9 billion in 2018, according to a recent report from ResearchAndMarkets.com.
0015.00013; China was the largest importer of baby formula, according to the market research firm.

0016.00001; People  Getty Images  By  David Ricketts  City veteran Dame Helena Morrissey has thrown her hat into the ring to succeed Mark Carney as the Bank of England governor  -  an appointment which could make her the first woman in the central bank's more than 300-year history to hold the top job.
0016.00002; Morrissey, who is head of personal investing at Legal & General Investment Management, is one of nine candidates that has been interviewed for the post, which first reported her application.
0016.00003; The news comes after a group of 28 MPs across several political parties called on Sajid Javid, the chancellor of the exchequer, to to replace Carney, who steps down from his role in January.
0016.00004; The letter to Javid, which was co-ordinated by non-profit group Positive Money, argued the next governor should be appointed on merit and not narrow political expediency.
0016.00005; Candidates commonly assumed to be in the running include Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, the UK regulator, Raghuram Rajan, former governor of the Reserve Bank of India, and Minouche Shafik, a former BoE deputy governor. The Bank of England advertised for Carney's replacement in April. The Canadian has been in the role since July 2013 and was initially going to leave the central bank in June 2018.
0016.00006; His tenure was extended twice to ensure stability ahead of Brexit he is currently due to stand down at the end of January.
0016.00007; READ  Morrissey, who is a former chief executive of Newton Investment Management, is not the only high-profile woman that has considered taking on the top central bank job.
0016.00008; Baroness Sharon Bowles, the former chair of the European parliament's influential economic and monetary affairs committee, applied for the role in 2012 when the position was last advertised.
0016.00009; Bowles said her application was in response to figures at the time which showed that only 14% of senior managers at the European Central Bank were women.
0016.00010; Bowles, who is now a Liberal Democrat peer, said she wanted her application to encourage more women to consider applying for senior financial services roles.

0017.00001; Wrightbus, one of Northern Ireland's largest employers with 1,400 staff, is expected to slump into administration tomorrow after failing to securing an eleventh-hour rescue deal. The move will represent the UK's second largest insolvency of the week, following the liquidation of the holiday group, Thomas Cook. The Ballymena-based engineering company, which manufactured the New Routemaster buses launched by then mayor of London Boris Johnson in 2012, had been scrambling to find a buyer.
0017.00002; At the end of last week, an expected sale evaporated when the Chinese engineering group Weichai and a firm led by the JCB heir, Jo Bamford, pulled out of talks. That double blow came just days after Northern Irish businessman Darren Donnelly also withdrew from making a potential bid for the firm.
0017.00003; The accounting group Deloitte, which had been running the sales auction for the company, is understood to have been lined up as an administrator.
0017.00004; Sources close to Wrights Group, the company behind Wrightbus, indicated that an announcement concerning its administration would likely be made on Wednesday morning.
0017.00005; Wrightbus, which was founded in 1946 as Robert Wright & Son Coachbuilders and began life working on lorries, has been struggling with its finances for months and made two rounds of redundancies last year with 95 jobs going in February and June.
0017.00006; It had some recent successes in selling its products, including a Transport for London (TfL) order for 20 brand new hydrogen-powered buses, which cost around £500,000 each and only emit water as exhaust in May.
0017.00007; However, Johnson's successor as mayor, Sadiq Khan, cancelled further purchases of the New Routemasters in 2016 and the company's finances came increasingly under pressure as the UK bus market slowed.
0017.00008; Bus operators had ordered a large number of vehicles in recent years to meet new emissions standards, but have now taken a cautious approach to new orders.
0017.00009; The state of Northern Ireland industry  The collapse of Harland and Wolff is just the latest blow to manufacturing in Northern Ireland, under pressure from firms offering cheaper labour costs abroad and weak economic environment. Multiple factories have closed there in recent years, with fears of more to come if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.
0017.00010; The manufacturing sector is disproportionately large in Northern Ireland compared with the rest of the UK. A study from Oxford Economics found it accounts for about a third of the economy, compared to only a tenth of the overall UK output.
0017.00011; The same study suggests that the sector supports 214,000 jobs directly and indirectly, or a quarter of all employment.
0017.00012; Much of Northern Ireland's manufacturing  -  from linen to shipbuilding  -  has fallen prey to the same forces of globalisation faced by the rest of the UK. Added to that is the new threat of a no-deal Brexit.
0017.00013; The government's own forecasts suggest a no-deal Brexit could lead to a sharp rise in unemployment, with at least 40,000 jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure.
0017.00014; Many of those jobs will be focused in manufacturing, heavily reliant on frictionless exports across the Irish border.
0017.00015; Bombardier  -  the Canadian aerospace firm , the historic Short Brothers operation which employ 3,600 people. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries bought a smaller part of the business in June.
0017.00016; Wrightbus  -  The maker of the new London Routemaster bus, ordered by Boris Johnson when he was mayor, is looking for a rescuer.
0017.00017; Around 1,400 jobs, mainly in Ballymena, Co Antrim, are at stake.
0017.00018; It blamed a downturn in demand from European lorries since the financial crisis. JTI Gallaher  -  The cigarette factory was another major Ballymena victim, .
0017.00019; The Japanese owners blamed falling demand for cigarettes in Europe, hitting the maker of the Silk Cut and Benson and Hedges brands. Photograph: Liam McBurney/PA  In its last set of accounts, for the 12 months to December 2017, Wrights Group made sales of £227m and a profit of £1.5m  -  figures down from £264m and £10.7m from the year before. The financial position of the company is thought to have deteriorated significantly since the last financial update.
0017.00020; Before the potential bidders pulled out of talks last week, the company had raised staff hopes that a deal was imminent.
0017.00021; On Thursday, Wrightbus management told employees it was now in a race to complete a final deal with credible bidders. It added: This ongoing business and its employees are our number one priority and we are confident that a positive outcome can be delivered over the next few days.

0018.00001; The NLNG which is owned by four shareholders, namely: the federal government of Nigeria, represented by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) with 49 per cent interest Shell Gas B.V. which has 25.6 per cent Total Gaz Electricite Holdings France with 15 per cent as well as Eni International N.A. N. V. S.àr. l  -  10.4 per cent, said it would by the end of October 2019, take a much-awaited final investment decision (FID) on the 'Train-7' expansion drive. He also noted that it would raise the global profile of Nigeria as the fourth largest exporter of LNG in the world.
0018.00002; Today, we are here to progress another milestone by issuing a Letter of Intent to award the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) Contract for Train 7 project to the preferred bidder SCD JV Consortium.
0018.00003; As we issue this Letter of Intent today, we will be even closer to signing of the FID, said Attah. From Attah's disclosure, the Train-7 FID looks certain to happen as scheduled.
0018.00004; He backed this up with his affirmation that the company's shareholders  -  NNPC, Shell, Total and Eni, were ready and willing to go on with it.
0018.00005; According to him: Train 7 is our sure way to attaining that ambition with 35 per cent increase in our production capacity, from 22mtpa to 30mtpa.
0018.00006; We are working to achieve this project within four to five years after we sign the FID if we must stay competitive and profitable in the global market.
0018.00007; The Fundamentals  To ensure the planned FID for Train-7 happens seamlessly, the NLNG which has paid as much as $36 billion to its shareholders as dividends over the years, in addition to paying joint venture (JV) gas suppliers $28 billion for feed gas supplies while helping Nigeria cut about 6.3 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of associated gas from been flared, said it has done what were needed in this regard. Attah, noted that the Front End Engineering Design (FEED) work for the expansion has been concluded, just at the same time the company paid off the loan and interests it took to build its existing six trains, to amongst other things clearly signpost its commitment to financial responsibility which potential investors in the Train-7 project would look out for. He equally noted that the selection of EPC contractors and signing of LoI with them were signs of its commitment to doing the right things for the FID to happen.
0018.00008; According to him, the LoI was one of the key milestones to be achieved on the road to FID by its shareholders, and that it showed commitment to realise the Train-7 project.
0018.00009; Attah, equally assured that the contracting process for the EPC contractor was transparent in full compliance with all applicable laws and good industry practices. Benefits to Nigeria  Speaking further, Attah, explained that the expected FID for NLNG's Train-7 would be a win-win for Nigeria.
0018.00010; He noted that in addition to attracting up to $10 billion worth of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow into Nigeria in the next five years, the capacity expansion would give Nigeria and its shareholders more returns from the monetisation of its natural gas.
0018.00011; He said the expected FDI would come in the form of $7 billion which would be spent to build the Train-7 LNG plant, and an additional $3 billion worth of investment on upstream gas development to meet the expected demands of the new capacity.
0018.00012; According to him: Our greater joy is that Train 7 at construction phase will attract an investment of over US$7 billion, boost Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) profile of the country, and provide about 10,000 jobs during the construction stage. His sentiments on the expected benefits from the expansion drive were equally shared by the Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Content Development Management Board (NCDMB), Mr. Simbi Wabote, who stated at the Abuja meeting that the project would bring to Nigeria a lot more especially in the application of the local content regulation in the construction of the plant.
0018.00013; Permit me to share with you some of the opportunities to be provided by the Train-7 project development to the local businesses and investments.
0018.00014; The NLNG Train-7 will deliver 100 per cent engineering of all non-cryogenic areas in-country.
0018.00015; The total in-country engineering manhours is set at 55 per cent which exceeds the minimum level stipulated in the NOGICD Act in line with our resolve to push beyond the boundary of limitations, said Wabote.
0018.00016; He indicated that the fabrication scope will bring many of Nigeria's fabrication yards into operation with over 70,000 tons of in-country fabrication covering condensate stabilisation units, tanks, pipe-racks, flare system, non-cryogenic vessels, and many other spools and fittings. The benefits extend to site civil works on roads, piling, and jetties, 100 per cent local procurement of all LV and HV cables, non-cryogenic valves, protective paints and coatings, sacrificial anodes and many other direct procurements from our local manufacturing plants.
0018.00017; Those in the service industry are not left out with the target to assemble over 70 per cent of all non-cryogenic pumps and control valves in-country.
0018.00018; Other spin-off opportunities include logistics, equipment leasing, insurance, hotels, office supplies, aviation, haulage, and many more.
0018.00019; The target job numbers are very exciting.
0018.00020; At its peak, the project will provide over 40,000 direct jobs and over 100,000 indirect and induced employment of over 100,000 workers, he added.
0018.00021; Support  The Chairman of the NLNG board, Mr. Osobonye LongJohn, said at the meeting that the board was fully in support of the project, and had approved the selection of the EPC contractor which it would also lend its support to.
0018.00022; LongJohn, indicated that the board was delighted to see the Train-7 expansion drive finally come through and explained: Our determination to achieve Train-7 has been sustained and we can only continue to work towards actualising that objective.
0018.00023; That is why we have gathered here to issue the Letter of Intent for the EPC contract.
0018.00024; He equally stated: I commend the management and staff of Nigeria LNG for showing such resilience that has brought us all to this point in the planning towards realizing Train 7.
0018.00025; I assure every party involved in this project, especially the preferred consortium of the unalloyed commitment of NLNG board of directors and the shareholders towards achieving Train 7 seamlessly as we live our vision of helping to build a better Nigeria.

0020.00001; Business  U.S. shale producers have added millions of barrels to global crude supply in recent years, but that does not mean they can quickly replace barrels lost from weekend attacks on Saudi Aramco facilities, energy experts said on Sunday.
0020.00002; Shale producers this year have been cutting budgets and workers and trimming production goals after years of heavy spending.
0020.00003; They remain under intense pressure from investors to restrain spending and return money to shareholders through buybacks and dividends rather than expand drilling.
0020.00004; Advertisement  Advertisement  Shale is a short-cycle oil supply - one able to add or reduce production relatively quickly.
0020.00005; Producers will see increased demand, especially from Asian buyers. But producers need 90 to 180 days to drill, complete and bring new production online. There are about 1,000 Permian wells that have been drilled but not completed or hooked up to pipelines, said Bernadette Johnson, vice president of market intelligence at consultants Enverus.
0020.00006; Shale cannot simply open up the spigot, she said, adding: The infrastructure simply isn't there yet to get it to the coast.
0020.00007; Representatives for Exxon Mobil Corp , Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron Corp , which all produce shale, declined to comment on the potential impact on their operations.
0020.00008; Advertisement  Advertisement  If the attacks lead to sustained U.S. oil prices in the mid-US$60-a-barrel range, it could cause U.S. output to grow by about 2 million barrels per day (bpd) next year, from about 1 million bpd this year, Johnson said.
0020.00009; U.S. oil companies could see some benefit.
0020.00010; The strikes in Saudi Arabia knocked out oil-processing facilities and production at the Khurais oilfield, which produces a light oil similar to what shale producers offer.
0020.00011; The Eagle Ford Shale field in South Texas has the ability to add to supplies and prices in the mid-US$60s would cause companies operating there to add rigs gradually.
0020.00012; Still, its ultralight, sweet barrels are not similar enough to be a good substitute for lost Arab Light oil, Johnson said.
0020.00013; Shale producers generally could use the expected jump in crude prices to add hedges, or contracts that lock in future prices, allowing them to capture some of the expected price increases, said Matt Portillo, managing director at investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.
0020.00014; sentifi.com  Channel NewsAsia - Sentifi topic widget Producers will take the higher prices and essentially bank that to balance-sheet repair or to accelerating shareholder returns, Portillo said.
0020.00015; U.S. oil companies operating in the Permian Basin will not be changing their plans this week based on what happened in Saudi Arabia, said Andy Lipow, president of consultancy Lipow Oil Associates.

0021.00001; U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos visits the Harrisburg Catholic Elementary School today.
0021.00002; By Steve Marroni | smarroni@pennlive.com  HARRISBURG  -  U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos visited the Harrisburg Catholic Elementary School today as part of her back-to-school tour, promoting a proposed federal tax-credit program that would allow for scholarships for more underprivileged students to have a choice of schools.
0021.00003; Her visit comes after Pennsylvania Gov.
0021.00004; Tom Wolf vetoed a bill that, similarly, would have nearly doubled the amount of tax credits the state makes available to businesses and other donors who make gifts to scholarship funds for private, parochial and other schools. One of her hosts for the event, Pennsylvania Speaker of the House Mike Turzai, also informally introduced a new proposal to revitalize his vetoed efforts to increase the amount of available scholarship funds.
0021.00005; If both the federal and state programs are passed, DeVos and Turzai said that could mean millions of dollars in scholarship funds and choice of schools for students in need, particularly in under-performing schools like the Harrisburg School District. Why wouldn't we try it? he asked. But opponents say programs like those DeVos and Turzai are promoting only harm public schools.
0021.00006; Betsy DeVos doesn't seem to understand that the best way to improve education is to invest the resources we need to provide a great neighborhood public school to every student, said Pennsylvania State Education Association President Rich Askey said in a statement today after DeVos' visit.
0021.00007; Voucher programs don't help students learn.
0021.00008; They drain money from public schools, and they don't hold private schools accountable for student achievement.
0021.00009; The secretary also faced criticism for visiting a school that bans transgender students and staff, CNN reports. CNN is reporting the Diocese of Harrisburg's student policy on Gender Identity Questions characterizes gender-affirming surgery, an option for some transgender individuals, as understood in Catholic moral terms as self-mutilation and therefore immoral.
0021.00010; Any student who undergoes such surgery would be ineligible to attend the school, according to the policy. We know that our state legislators care about all Pennsylvanians, but by allowing public funding to flow to institutions that explicitly ban LGBT children and youth, they are reinforcing the cruelty of discrimination in public accommodations. They must take action to ensure nondiscrimination protections attach wherever government funding is used, said Jason Landau Goodman, Executive Director of the Pennsylvania Youth Congress, said in a statement Thursday.
0021.00011; In her stop today, DeVos visited several classrooms in the Catholic elementary school on Liberty Street.
0021.00012; The seventh graders showed her the lessons they have learned in latitude and longitude, the fifth-grade science class discussed the constellations, and the secretary read a story to an excitable group of pre-school students.
0021.00013; In addition to visiting the students, she said she came to promote the proposed Education Freedom Scholarships program.
0021.00014; DeVos told a group of about 20 private-education supporters the program would establish a federal tax credit of $5 billion, in which states could voluntary participate. Should Pennsylvania participate, it would receive roughly $156 million annually to add to programs like the Educational Improvement Tax Credit.
0021.00015; I was so disappointed with the most recent veto that would have addressed the needs of tens of thousands of families, DeVos told the group.
0021.00016; I encourage people to think broadly and creatively to bring education freedom.
0021.00017; She said the program would benefit the most vulnerable student be privately funded by donations, take no money from public schools and expand access to educational opportunities for families.
0021.00018; And Turzai informally unveiled his new efforts today, as well.
0021.00019; Wolf had vetoed the speaker's previous bill, saying he cannot allow such a large increase in the Educational Improvement Tax Credit program when many of the state's public school systems are teetering on the brink of fiscal calamity.
0021.00020; He also criticized the proposed expansion as too costly, saying it would sap about $650 million from the state's general fund over the next five years.
0021.00021; Turzai said his new proposal would take nothing away from public schools and would benefit all students, as public schools would still get the same level of per-student funding, even if their student count decreases.
0021.00022; We wanted to make sure lots of families had the opportunity to make use of these tax credit scholarships, he said.
0021.00023; Today we have $180 million in just scholarships.
0021.00024; That's great, but it's not enough.
0021.00025; Programs like the EITC have allowed children like Thalia McClenton's two sons attend Harrisburg Catholic Elementary School.
0021.00026; She said one of her children was having trouble in the Harrisburg School District, and things turned around right away when she sent her children, Joshua and Christian, to the Catholic school.
0021.00027; She said she couldn't have done it without the help of the scholarships. They're able to get the quality of education I know they deserve, McClenton told the secretary of education. These kids, my kids, are the figure.
0021.00028; Others shared similar stories. Rev. Ted Clater of the REACH Foundation said there are always students who need more opportunities than what are available at their public schools.
0021.00029; We need enhance opportunities for parents to engage in choice to get the education their kids need, he said.
0021.00030; Not everyone shares that assessment.
0021.00031; Jody Barksdale, president of the Harrisburg Education Association, said in a statement that the Harrisburg School District is already seeing progress after being placed into state receivership, and voucher programs could jeopardize that. Harrisburg's students and educators are feeling optimistic, Barksdale said. Teachers are getting more support, and students are starting the year on the right track.
0021.00032; Any voucher scheme that drains millions from our schools would stop that progress and set Harrisburg back for a very long time.
0021.00033; Educators know what works and what doesn't in our public schools, Askey added.
0021.00034; What we need are investments in public schools that serve every student, not failed programs that take taxpayers' money away from them.

0024.00001; A former Wellington restaurant owner has been sentenced to five months home detention and 200 hours of community work for filing false Income Tax and GST returns and evading tax.
0024.00002; Darrell Earl Antonopoulos plead guilty to three charges of aiding or abetting his company, Whonere Holdings Limited, trading as La Casa Pasta restaurant, to provide false Income Tax returns and 24 charges of providing false GST returns to Inland Revenue with the intention of evading tax.
0024.00003; Mr Antonopoulos was charged under the Tax Administration Act. Mr Antonopoulos admitted to knowing his tax obligations yet deliberately filed false Income Tax and GST returns on behalf of his company over a four year period and dealt in cash, Assurance Manager Investigations, Tony Morris, said. An examination of the restaurant's daily sales receipts and bank deposits showed that a significant number of customers were paying in cash.
0024.00004; The company did not disclose any of these sales and MrAntonopoulos diverted that cash for his own benefit. Mr Morris said that an initial analysis of Mr Antonopoulos' financial records showed that the restaurant's gross profits were low when compared to other similar businesses. Benchmarking the performance of businesses within the same sector enables Inland Revenue to identify taxpayers likely to be suppressing income.
0024.00005; Once identified, Inland Revenue has a number of techniques and tools at its disposal to verify whether cash sales have been omitted and to quantify that omission.
0024.00006; Businesses and individuals doing the right thing can be confident that Inland Revenue will detect those evading their obligations.
0024.00007; Those cheating on their taxes should be aware that Inland Revenue has allocated substantial resources and is using increasingly sophisticated methods to detect tax evasion and will take action against serious non-compliance. Inland Revenue has recovered $361,000 from Mr Antonopoulos and just over $88,600 remains outstanding.
0024.00008; The restaurant, La Casa Pasta, has been sold and is under new management.

0025.00001; Steel demand to improve in H2, but weak H1 expected: Crisil Global steel prices dropped 13 per cent in the first eight months of 2019 due to weak demand By  Rakhi Mazumdar  , ET Bureau|  Updated: Sep 25, 2019, 03.44 PM IST  0Comments  Reuters  Indian steel manufacturers' earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) spreads contracted 420 basis points (bps) on-year in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
0025.00002; Kolkata: Domestic steel demand and global market sentiment is likely to improve in the second half, but a weak first half is expected to lead to a 5-6 per cent contraction in realisations for steel makers this fiscal, ratings agency Crisil has said in its latest research report on the sector.
0025.00003; Falling spreads on earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) will weigh on steel sector capex, the report said, adding that the industry is yet to see a recovery in prices despite a run-up in raw material costs.
0025.00004; Global steel prices dropped 13 per cent in the first eight months of 2019 due to weak demand, unseasonal jump in global inventory levels of upto nearly 35 per cent through August and trade tensions, the report said.
0025.00005; This was despite a whopping 56 per cent run-up in global iron ore prices during the same period.
0025.00006; Steel prices in India mirrored the trend, falling 10 per cent from Rs 42,000 per tonne in January to Rs 38,000 per tonne in August 2019, the report added. Not surprisingly, Indian steel manufacturers' earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) spreads contracted 420 basis points (bps) on-year in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
0025.00007; The contraction was more for large non-integrated players, at 470 bps.
0025.00008; To add to it, subdued domestic demand and weak export markets cloud the industry's prospects in the rest of this fiscal as well, the Crisil report said.
0025.00009; After a robust 7.5-8 per cent growth in the previous two fiscals, the domestic steel industry is expected to witness a mid-cycle slowdown at 4-5 per cent this fiscal, given muted construction investments and weak automotive market, the report predicted.
0025.00010; Prasad Koparkar, senior director, CRISIL Research said: Steel prices have not been able to recover despite a cost push. We therefore believe weak realisations will shear 350-370 bps off the sector's Ebitda margins for the first half and 200-250 bps for the fiscal as a whole, reversing a three-year climb.
0025.00011; Large non-integrated players will see their margins shrink more, by 300-350 bps this fiscal, given weak flat steel market and a 3-5 per cent rise in iron ore prices amidst weak realizations, he added.
0025.00012; All this will be a drag on the sector's aggregate operating profit, which is expected to fall 12-13 per cent in fiscal 2020.
0025.00013; What's more, large brownfield expansion plans, capacity acquisitions under the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) process, and high leverage of global assets will weigh on return ratio in the near to medium term.
0025.00014; The industry plans to add 28-30 million tonne (MT) steel capacity in the next 5 years, entailing a capital expenditure of Rs 1.4-1.5 lakh crore.
0025.00015; Of this, nearly three-fourth of capacity will be added by large players, apart from assets being acquired under NCLT by these companies.
0025.00016; Falling spreads amidst high leverage will potentially slow down the investment plans in the near term, Hetal Gandhi, Director, CRISIL Research said. While in the near term the sector shall witness rising leverage, however, support in the form of prevailing anti-dumping duty across steel products (for period of five years) will help avoid the freefall of prices and profit as seen back in fiscal 2016.
0025.00017; Recovery in global market, domestic demand growth, and upcoming iron ore auctions will be key determinants of the sector's performance in the near term, the report added.

0026.00001; Persistent low base rates have caused a sustained period of depressed financial returns, resulting in long-term changes to the way financial services products are funded. Falling returns in many traditional investment areas have forced both shorter-term and longer-term investors to engage more extensively in higher-risk areas.
0026.00002; In this search for yield, new sources of funding have entered sectors previously seen as too niche and complex, further pressuring the returns available to traditional funders.
0026.00003; The participation of new funding sources has had far-reaching effects in some sectors, including speciality (re)insurance, MGA models in insurance, equity release and second charge lending. For well-funded and well-prepared industry participants, there is an opportunity to expand into new customer segments and address new needs.
0026.00004; The sustained period of depressed financial returns because of persistent low base rates has resulted in long-term, if not permanent, changes to the way some financial services products are funded.
0026.00005; In the search for yield, new sources of funding have entered sectors previously seen as too niche and complex, finding ways to address them which won't easily be unlearned. Base rates have been so low for so long that old-school assumptions that the investment cycle will inevitably turn (with a flight from these newly capital-rich areas, for instance) are no longer obviously true, at least in the short term.
0026.00006; Investors and funders need to recognise this, and industry participants awaiting the inevitable retrenchment of competition as rates eventually rise may need to think again and consider what may be a new paradigm.
0026.00007; For those players that undertake in-depth market analysis to inform their strategic direction, there are significant opportunities in these once-unloved niches.
0026.00008; Historically, in many investment areas capital flow has been driven by a repeating cycle, with the insurance industry being the classic example. Premiums rise after significant losses, leading to increasing profits and greater funding, which in turn pushes prices down until the cycle starts again (see Figure 1).
0026.00009; Enlarge Image  Yet this traditional model appears to be broken or severely strained. Sustained low base rates have transformed the absolute and relative attractiveness of many areas of investment, affecting both the amount and destination of investors' capital. The new normal is for capital holders to seek more risk, rather than less, in order to achieve their target levels of return.
0026.00010; Returns in many traditional areas of investment have dropped to the extent that capital holders have shopped around far more than before, including outside their normal focus zones.
0026.00011; In bonds and other categories, returns have fallen below threshold levels for many investors, giving them little option but to move their funds.
0026.00012; The longevity of this effect has meant that investors have had to review their strategic options and take action because, given their investment horizons and the need to deploy capital, they can no longer afford to wait it out.
0026.00013; The situation is urgent for shorter-term investors, but even longer-term investors, such as pension funds and family offices, which can usually ignore the short part of the yield curve, have been affected and have been forced to invest more extensively in higher-risk areas.
0026.00014; There have been far-reaching effects in some subsectors of financial services. This has led to a significant change in the volume of capital invested by those with relevant expertise and underwriting experience.
0026.00015; It has also led to the entry of new funder types that were traditionally thought (including by themselves) to be unqualified to participate, but that are attracted by the returns. This drive by new funders to participate in niche sectors has resulted in changes to distribution and underwriting models, with underwriting, origination and product design separated from capital provision much more rapidly and to a greater degree than ever before, as the examples below demonstrate.
0026.00016; The resulting waves of new money have added further pressure to the returns available to previous traditional funders.
0026.00017; Speciality (re)insurance Speciality (re)insurance has seen a recent flood of non-specialist capital providers (i.e. those with no underwriting expertise or interest in acquiring it) in search of better returns, in particular in insurance-linked securities (ILS) like catastrophe bonds, new collateralised vehicles and post-event funds, as well as other investable financial instruments (see Figure 2).
0026.00018; In 2017, pension funds invested nearly $90 billion in ILS, over 3.5 times the amount invested in 2011, according to Wills Towers Watson Securities data1.
0026.00019; This was in spite of the sector's $136 billion of losses that followed the three U.S. hurricanes and California wildfires in 2017  -  catastrophes that cost, for example, Berkshire Hathaway insurance underwriting losses of $3 billion after 14 consecutive years of profits2.
0026.00020; Enlarge Image  In terms of new business model development, the past few years have seen the rise of outsourced managing general agents (MGAs) to increase insurers' underwriting capacity. For example, members of the U.K.'s MGA Association now write gross written premiums of over £5 billion, up from £2.5 billion in 20133.
0026.00021; The strong growth of the MGA model has allowed the greater separation of underwriting expertise from capital provision.
0026.00022; Crucially, the underlying capacity provision to MGAs now much more frequently includes non-specialist capital providers who, in their search for yield, are prepared to invest in this category due to a dearth of other opportunities.
0026.00023; Now that this route to market has been established, it will not go away: non-expert capital is available to participate whenever returns indicate that it is favourable to do so.
0026.00024; Historically, equity release lending has been supported by a combination of traditional banks and insurance companies, both of which were well-versed in underwriting and risk assessment of this type, and experienced in the risk vs. reward trade-offs relevant to participating in this market.
0026.00025; However, in recent years, persistent low base rates, assisted by changes in regulation around how products are sold and customer affordability checks, have resulted in transformational changes:  The addressable market for equity release has significantly grown, as products have become financially viable for more people and address a broader range of needs (see L.E.K. Similar to specialist (re)insurance, now that this route to market has been established, it will not go away in the future, with non-expert capital available to participate whenever returns indicate that it is favourable to do so. Second charge mortgage lending is another formerly niche market that is becoming increasingly mainstream in the U.K. It has witnessed substantial growth in the past few years, with the Finance and Leasing Association stating that the market's total value grew to over £1 billion for the 12 months to December 20185.
0026.00026; Lower base rates have resulted in transformational changes to the addressable market.
0026.00027; Typical prime rates were in mid-to-high single digits around the time of the financial crisis, meaning that prime customers, having other lower rate options such as unsecured loans, would reject these products out of hand.
0026.00028; However, rates available through prime lenders are now often in the range of 3-4%  -  comparable to prime mortgages  -  which radically increases the range of potential customers.
0026.00029; Now that these customers are, for the first time, aware of second charge as a viable alternative financing option, it is likely that this product has permanently entered the mainstream. Simultaneously, second charge has also seen an increase in funding through securitisation.
0026.00030; For example, Optimum Credit completed a public securitisation of second charge mortgages in July 2017, the sector's first since the credit crisis. Its triple A notes were more than two times oversubscribed.
0026.00031; Two months later, lender Together was similarly oversubscribed when it completed its £275 million securitisation. Standard funding has thus re-entered this market, again through a new route that is unlikely to be forgotten.
0026.00032; The lower for longer dynamic has, at least temporarily, both grown the size of the addressable market for a number of previously niche markets and opened up participation opportunities to new sources of capital.
0026.00033; These are facts which industry participants, funders and investors alike need to be aware of as they look to address the available commercial opportunities.
0026.00034; New funding has also had the secondary impact of making it easier to scale previously balance sheet-heavy businesses originating financial services products, most notably in insurance and lending.
0026.00035; Rather than self-funding, businesses in these areas can now, if they want to, focus on their underwriting and origination skills. In addition, when their capital providers are at the limits of their investment appetite or capacity, rather than selling out before they realise the fruit of their operational labours, they may continue with external capital from non-expert or securitisation sources.
0026.00036; This will allow them to hold on until fuller operational maturity and thus an increased valuation at sale. For early stage or otherwise capital-constrained investors in these categories, there are opportunities to hold on to their assets for longer and reap more of the rewards of developing mature businesses.
0026.00037; By sourcing alternative external funding, they can bridge the gap between implementing actions with medium-term impact and achieving the runs on the board, which lead to full valuations.
0026.00038; LDF, an SME lending platform developed by Cabot Square Capital, is an archetypal example of this approach.
0026.00039; Furthermore, there are fresh opportunities to act as market intermediaries, through underwriting and product structuring, without the need to self-finance the balance sheet: a new class of investible business is emerging.
0026.00040; Persistent low base rates have resulted in a sustained period of depressed financial returns. However, as a result, a wide range of new investment opportunities has arisen for funders and investors. Those that take a robust approach to market scoping, scenario planning and business case development may capitalise on these complex and rapidly evolving environments.
0026.00041; For well-funded and well-prepared industry participants, the opportunity to expand to new customer segments, address new needs and grow the size of the pie has never been better.

0028.00001; Chinese ecommerce platform ClubFactory is in the crosshairs of the Delhi commissioner of customs over non-compliance with Customs Act 1962.
0028.00002; Goods imported by the company were confiscated by the office of the commissioner of customs (air cargo export) as they were found to be mis-declared as business to business (B2B) shipment while the department found it to be business to consumer (B2C) shipment, according to the preliminary investigations. Documents reviewed by TechCircle show that Globemax Commerce India, a fully owned subsidiary of Hong Kong-registered holding company of ClubFactory A2Z Trade, has been asked to submit documentation to further the investigation.
0028.00003; Globemax Commerce India has been asked to submit its balance sheets, auditor reports and sale and purchase ledgers dating back to five years as well as the copy of the agreement with its foreign supplier.
0028.00004; If found to be non-compliant under the Customs Act, ClubFactory will be required to deposit the due amount as part of customs duty as well as penalty or, in extreme cases, might lead to criminal proceedings.
0028.00005; If the documents filed by the company were falsified, the customs officials can ask the company to pay a penalty of up to five times the value of goods under the provisions of Section 114 AA of Customs Act.
0028.00006; Key employees and directors of the company can also be criminally prosecuted in extreme cases, said Sandeep Chilana, managing partner at Chilana & Chilana Law Offices and an expert in commercial and tax litigation.
0028.00007; Club Factory is witnessing very healthy growth in India and is growing consistently.
0028.00008; With our strategy to charge zero commission fee form sellers, we are helping the ecommerce industry grow by empowering local sellers and benefiting consumers by offering the best possible price.
0028.00009; Our business in India complies with local regulations and we have strict measures in place to take action against sellers who might violate any local policy, ClubFactory said in a statement in response to specific email queries.
0028.00010; It will not be the first time ClubFactory has had to face the heat for evading customs duty.
0028.00011; Earlier, the Mumbai port had clamped down on the misuse of gift channel by cross border ecommerce players, leading to the temporary suspension of services by SheIn and ClubFactory. The provision of gift channel exempts gifts to friends and family sent by Non-Resident Indians up to a value of Rs 5,000 from taxation.
0028.00012; There are two routes of commercial imports - either through an Indian intermediary who clears the goods from customs and pays the required duties or getting the customs clearance done by the courier partner who delivers the goods directly to the end customer, said Chilana.
0028.00013; Multiple cross-border players were found to be misusing the provision for shipping goods from sellers outside of India to customers in the country. In July, citizen engagement platform LocalCircles had written to the Central Board of Indirect Taxes to fix a flat rate of customs and GST at 42.05%.

0030.00001; Various sectors have been pushing for a plethora of concerns to be reviewed from rate-cuts to GST returns, to the Council's own agenda of boosting revenue collections and the prevention of frauds.
0030.00002; The sectors pushing for rate cuts at the moment are the auto-sector, FMCG sector especially biscuit-manufacturers, and cement.
0030.00003; The automobile industry is experiencing its worst slump in two decades, and despite several measures being announced in the recent past to boost sales, manufacturers seem to be convinced that a rate-cut in GST could be the only possibility to combat the decreasing sales numbers.
0030.00004; Builders, on the other hand, cannot pass on the high 28% GST on cement due to the inverted duty structure and have to absorb costs themselves.
0030.00005; Hence, they are looking for an overall slash in the GST rates on cement.
0030.00006; Rate-cuts, though being constantly pushed for by various sectors, seems unlikely in this Council meeting, due to the fall in GST revenue collections, which the government is rather hoping to boost at this point in time. However, the same could be up for review for a decision to be taken at a later date.
0030.00007; One of the other major issues we can see the Council focussing on is battling GST frauds, which seems to have become a common occurrence. Of late, the government has noticed revenue leakages to the extent of Rs.50,000 crore, which is a huge amount to ignore, considering the declining revenue collections.
0030.00008; Also Read: GST Council to Address Issues Related to Inverted Duty Structure  The Council is expected to suggest measures that will involve the state governments, asking them to intervene to tighten the overall processes, in the hope of preventing tax evaders from finding any further loopholes in the system. On the GST returns front, the situation right now is unfavourable with the annual return GSTR-9 to be filed for FY 17-18, getting extended yet again for the fourth time. The lengthy and complicated return form has resulted in backlash from large and small taxpayers alike, with CAs and businesses pressurizing the government to either simplify the return form or eliminate it altogether.
0030.00009; The fate of the GSTR-9 return now lies in the hands of the Council members and even a simplified return form now, at the zero hours, will be a much-awaited boon to taxpayers.
0030.00010; The new return system under GST, scheduled to be implemented from October 2019 onwards, seems to be in a state of limbo due to the uncertainties associated with the GSTR-9 return.
0030.00011; It may not be the wisest decision for the government to introduce something new at this time, and there could be a possibility of the new return system getting deferred to the next year.
0030.00012; The same is also expected to be discussed in the upcoming meet. Overall, there is a lot to look forward to this Council meeting, and taxpayers are hoping that the outcomes will not disappoint.

0031.00001; By Digital News Asia September 19, 2019 Plan to triple traditional dealers' transaction volume to over US$500mil Emerges as largest shareholder in myTukar, adds Malaysia to Thai and Indon ops  Carro, a Singapore-based Southeast Asian (SEA) automotive marketplace, today announced that it has invested US$30 million (RM125.4 million) into Malaysia-based car bidding platform myTukar to digitise the local used car dealer industry.
0031.00002; With this strategic investment, Carro's technology will power myTukar to digitally enable the traditional used car dealerships across Malaysia, boost inter-city car sales and help local businesses grow. According to Aaron Tan, founder and chief executive officer of Carro, the investment makes Carro the single largest shareholder in myTukar, though not a majority shareholder. Founded in 2015, Carro has raised a total of US$108 million (RM451.5 million) over seven funding rounds.
0031.00003; The startup aims to transform car sales for both private sellers and dealers.
0031.00004; Established in Singapore, it has since expanded to Indonesia and Thailand and claims to have created the region's largest marketplace for automobiles.
0031.00005; Across the three markets, Carro says it has facilitated over US$500 million (RM2.09 billion) worth of transactions in 2018.
0031.00006; Carro's entry into Malaysia via myTukar signifies the latest step in its regional expansion to help traditional car dealerships connect with private sellers via e-commerce channels. While Carro seeks to help the traditional dealers expand their market reach across the country, the move is also aimed at helping the dealers reach out to a larger pool of private sellers to grow their revenues.
0031.00007; Malaysia is one of the leading automotive markets and most digitally savvy countries in SEA, so this was the next logical step for us after expanding in Indonesia and Thailand, said Aaron Tan, CEO and Founder of Carro.
0031.00008; Through myTukar we plan on working with thousands of dealers across Malaysia to catalyse the growth of the used car market.
0031.00009; Over the next few years, we plan to triple their existing transaction volume to over US$500 million.
0031.00010; Launched in 2018, myTukar is a Malaysian online car bidding platform that seeks to transform the traditional pre-owned car ownership process in the country.
0031.00011; Through its e-commerce channel, myTukar allows private sellers to schedule a vehicle inspection with a sales service agent. Following which, the platform will help to facilitate a live bidding process amongst more than 1,500 dealers that myTukar currently works with nationwide.
0031.00012; To provide sellers with a more transparent and worry-free experience, last year the company partnered with a local vehicle warranty provider to offer up to six months' warranty for vehicles traded on its platform. Malaysia's used car marketplace has been underperforming over the last decade, chiefly due to used car dealerships facing stagnating sales during this period. To grow their revenues, traditional dealerships here must embrace digital technology to reach a wider customer base, said Fong Hon Sum, founder and chief executive officer of myTukar.
0031.00013; Malaysia's used car dealerships are a pillar of its automotive sector, and therefore we believe our platform can help them bridge the digital divide to reach today's tech-savvy car buyers and sellers.
0031.00014; Carro's investment will be highly crucial for our vision. With their technological support and regional experience, we believe that we can work together to enhance the digital experience of Malaysian car dealerships across the country.

0034.00001; Print Bookmark Opinion | TD originals  Negative Interest Rates a Disaster for U.S., No Matter What Trump Says comments  Chairman of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell. (Patrick Semansky / AP)  The dollar strengthened against the euro in August, merely in anticipation of the European Central Bank slashing its key interest rate further into negative territory.
0034.00002; Investors were fleeing into the dollar, prompting President Trump to tweet on Aug. 30:  The Euro is dropping against the Dollar like crazy, giving them a big export and manufacturing advantage…and the Fed does NOTHING! Our Dollar is now the strongest in history.
0034.00003; Sounds good, doesn't it?
0034.00004; INTEREST COST COULD BE BROUGHT WAY DOWN, while at the same time substantially lengthening the term.
0034.00005; They are trying, and succeeding, in depreciating the Euro against the VERY strong Dollar, hurting U.S. exports…. And the Fed sits, and sits, and sits. They get paid to borrow money, while we are paying interest!
0034.00006; -  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 12, 2019  However, negative interest rates have not been shown to stimulate the economies that have tried them, and they would wreak havoc on the U.S. economy, for reasons unique to the U.S. dollar.
0034.00007; The ECB has not gone to negative interest rates to gain an export advantage.
0034.00008; It is to keep the European Union from falling apart, something that could happen if the United Kingdom does indeed pull out and Italy follows suit, as it has threatened to do.
0034.00009; If what Trump wants is cheap borrowing rates for the U.S. federal government, there is a safer and easier way to get them.
0034.00010; The Real Reason the ECB Has Gone to Negative Interest Rates  Why the ECB has gone negative was nailed by Wolf Richter in a Sept. 18 article on WolfStreet.com.
0034.00011; After noting that negative interest rates have not proved to be beneficial for any economy in which they are currently in operation and have had seriously destructive side effects for the people and the banks, he said:  However, negative interest rates as follow-up and addition to massive QE were effective in keeping the Eurozone glued together because they allowed countries to stay afloat that cannot, but would need to, print their own money to stay afloat. They did so by making funding plentiful and nearly free, or free, or more than free. This includes Italian government debt, which has a negative yield through three-year maturities.
0034.00012; … The ECB's latest rate cut, minuscule and controversial as it was, was designed to help out Italy further so it wouldn't have to abandon the euro and break out of the Eurozone.
0034.00013; The U.S. doesn't need negative interest rates to stay glued together.
0034.00014; It can print its own money.
0034.00015; EU member governments have lost the sovereign power to issue their own money or borrow money issued by their own central banks.
0034.00016; The EU experiment was a failed monetarist attempt to maintain a fixed money supply, as if the euro were a commodity in limited supply like gold.
0034.00017; The central banks of member countries do not have the power to bail out their governments or their failing local banks as the Fed did for U.S. banks with massive quantitative easing after the 2008 financial crisis.
0034.00018; Before the Eurozone debt crisis of 2011-12, even the European Central Bank was forbidden to buy sovereign debt.
0034.00019; The rules changed after Greece and other southern European countries got into serious trouble, sending bond yields (nominal interest rates) through the roof.
0034.00020; But default or debt restructuring was not considered an option and in 2016, new EU rules required a bail in before a government could bail out its failing banks. When a bank ran into trouble, existing stakeholders - including shareholders, junior creditors and sometimes even senior creditors and depositors with deposits in excess of the guaranteed amount of €100,000 - were required to take a loss before public funds could be used. Also included in Italy were subordinated bonds that were owned not just by well-off families and other banks but by small savers who in many cases were fraudulently mis-sold the bonds as being risk-free (basically as good as deposits).
0034.00021; The Italian government got a taste of the potential backlash when it forced losses onto the bondholders of four small banks.
0034.00022; One victim made headlines when he hung himself and left a note blaming his bank, which had taken his entire €100,000 savings.
0034.00023; Meanwhile, the bail-in scheme that was supposed to shift bank losses from governments to bank creditors and depositors served instead to scare off depositors and investors, making shaky banks even shakier.
0034.00024; Worse, heightened capital requirements made it practically impossible for Italian banks to raise capital.
0034.00025; Rather than flirt with another bail-in disaster, Italy was ready either to flaunt EU rules or leave the Union.
0034.00026; The ECB finally got on the quantitative easing bandwagon and started buying government debt along with other financial assets. By buying debt at negative interest, it is not only relieving EU governments of their interest burden, but it is also slowly extinguishing the debt itself.
0034.00027; That explains the ECB, but why are investors buying these bonds?
0034.00028; According to John Ainger in Bloomberg:  Investors are willing to pay a premium - and ultimately take a loss - because they need the reliability and liquidity that the government and high-quality corporate bonds provide. Large investors such as pension funds, insurers, and financial institutions may have few other safe places to store their wealth.
0034.00029; In short, they are captive buyers. Banks are required to hold government securities or other high-quality liquid assets under capital rules imposed by the Financial Stability Board in Switzerland.
0034.00030; Since EU banks now must pay the ECB to hold their bank reserves, they may as well hold negative-yielding sovereign debt, which they may be able to sell at a profit if rates drop even further.
0034.00031; Wolf Richter comments:  Investors who buy these bonds hope that central banks will take them off their hands at even lower yields (and higher prices).
0034.00032; No one is buying a negative yielding long-term bond to hold it to maturity.
0034.00033; Well, I say that, but these are professional money managers who buy such instruments, or who have to buy them due to their asset allocation and fiduciary requirements, and they don't really care.
0034.00034; It's other people's money, and they're going to change jobs or get promoted or start a restaurant or something, and they're out of there in a couple of years.
0034.00035; Why the U.S. Can't Go Negative, and What It Can Do Instead  The U.S. doesn't need negative interest rates, because it doesn't have the EU's problems but it does have other problems unique to the U.S. dollar that could spell disaster if negative rates were enforced.
0034.00036; First is the massive market for money market funds, which are more important to daily market functioning in the U.S. than in Europe and Japan.
0034.00037; If interest rates go negative, the funds could see large-scale outflows, which could disrupt short-term funding for businesses, banks and perhaps even the Treasury.
0034.00038; Consumers could also face new charges to make up for bank losses.
0034.00039; Second, the U.S. dollar is inextricably tied up with the market for interest rate derivatives, which is currently valued at over $500 trillion.
0034.00040; As proprietary analyst Rob Kirby explains, the economy would crash if interest rates went negative, because the banks holding the fixed-rate side of the swaps would have to pay the floating-rate side as well.
0034.00041; The derivatives market would go down like a stack of dominoes and take the U.S. economy with it. Perhaps in tacit acknowledgment of those problems, Fed Chairman Jay Powell responded to a question about negative interest rates on Sept. 18:  Negative interest rates [are] something that we looked at during the financial crisis and chose not to do. After we got to the effective lower bound [near-zero effective federal funds rate], we chose to do a lot of aggressive forward guidance and also large-scale asset purchases.
0034.00042; …  And if we were to find ourselves at some future date again at the effective lower bound - not something we are expecting - then I think we would look at using large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance.
0034.00043; I do not think we'd be looking at using negative rates. Assuming the large-scale asset purchases made at some future date were of federal securities, the federal government would be financing its debt virtually interest-free, since the Fed returns its profits to the Treasury after deducting its costs.
0034.00044; And if the bonds were rolled over when due and held by the Fed indefinitely, the money could be had not only interest-free but debt-free.
0034.00045; That is not radical theory but is what is actually happening with the Fed's bond purchases in its earlier QE.
0034.00046; When it tried to unwind those purchases last fall, the result was a stock market crisis. The Fed is learning that QE is a one-way street.
0034.00047; The problem under existing law is that neither the president nor Congress has control over whether the independent Fed buys federal securities. But if Trump can't get Powell to agree over lunch to these arrangements, Congress could amend the Federal Reserve Act to require the Fed to work with Congress to coordinate fiscal and monetary policy.
0034.00048; This is what Japan's banking law requires, and it has been very successful under Prime Minister Shinzō Abe and Abenomics.
0034.00049; It is also what a team of former central bankers led by Philipp Hildebrand proposed in conjunction with last month's Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers, after acknowledging the central bankers' usual tools weren't working.
0034.00050; Under their proposal, central bank technocrats would be in charge of allocating the funds, but better would be the Japanese model, which leaves the federal government in control of allocating fiscal policy funds.
0034.00051; The Bank of Japan now holds nearly half of Japan's federal debt, a radical move that has not triggered hyperinflation as monetarist economists direly predicted.
0034.00052; In fact, the Bank of Japan can't get the country's inflation rate even to its modest 2 percent target.
0034.00053; As of August, the rate was an extremely low 0.3%.
0034.00054; If the Fed were to follow suit and buy 50% of the U.S. government's debt, the Treasury could swell its coffers by $11 trillion in interest-free money.
0034.00055; And if the Fed kept rolling over the debt, Congress and the president could get this $11 trillion not only interest-free but debt-free.
0034.00056; President Trump can't get a better deal than that.

0037.00001; We consider the options available to you when starting your own business.
0037.00002; There are tax and legal implications which have a bearing on the choice you make. If you are  starting, or have recently started a business in the Essex area we, at  Baker Chapman, can help you decide on an appropriate business structure.
0037.00003; Having made the decision to be your own boss, it is important to decide the best legal and taxation structure for your enterprise.
0037.00004; The most suitable structure for you will depend on your personal situation and your future plans.
0037.00005; The decision you make will have repercussions on the way you are taxed, your exposure to creditors and other matters.
0037.00006; The possible options you have are as follows: Sole trader This is the simplest way of trading.
0037.00007; There are only a few formalities to trading this way, the most important of which is informing HMRC. You are required to keep business records in order to calculate profits each year and they will form the basis of how you pay your tax and national insurance.
0037.00008; Any profits generated in this medium are automatically yours. The business of a sole trader is not distinguished from the proprietor's personal affairs so that if there are any debts, you are legally liable to pay those debts down to your last worldly possession.
0037.00009; Partnership A partnership is an extension of being a sole trader.
0037.00010; Here, a group of two or more people will come together, pool their talents, clients and business contacts so that, collectively, they can build a more successful business than they would individually. The partners will agree to share the joint profits in pre-determined percentages.
0037.00011; It is advisable to draw up a Partnership Agreement which sets the rules of how the partners will work together.
0037.00012; Partners are taxed in the same way as sole traders, but only on their own share of the partnership profits.
0037.00013; As with sole traders, the partners are legally liable to pay the debts of the business. Each partner is 'jointly and severally' liable for the partnership debts, so that if certain partners are unable to pay their share of the partnership debts then those debts can fall on the other partners. Limited company A limited company is a separate legal entity from its owners.
0037.00014; It can trade, own assets and incur liabilities in its own right. Your ownership of the company is recognised by owning shares in that company.
0037.00015; If you also work for the company, you are both the owner (shareholder) and an employee of that company.
0037.00016; When a company generates profits, they are the company's property.
0037.00017; Should you wish to extract money from the company, you must either pay a dividend to the shareholders, or a salary as an employee.
0037.00018; The advantage to you is that you can have a balance of these two to minimise your overall tax and national insurance liability.
0037.00019; Companies themselves pay corporation tax on their profits after paying your salary but before your dividend distribution.
0037.00020; Effective tax planning requires profits, salary and dividends to be considered together.
0037.00021; There are many advantages as well as disadvantages to operating through a limited company.
0037.00022; We have a separate factsheet on 'Incorporation' which considers the relative merits as well as the downsides of operating as a company. New companies can be purchased in a ready-made form usually referred to as 'off the shelf' companies.
0037.00023; These types of formation are becoming less frequent however as the speed of which companies can now be created takes on average 3 hours rather than days.
0037.00024; There are additional administrative factors in running a company, such as statutory accounts preparation, company secretarial obligations and PAYE (Pay as You Earn) procedures. A big advantage of owning a limited company is that your personal liability is limited to the nominal share capital you have invested.
0037.00025; Limited liability partnership A limited liability partnership is legally similar to a company. It is administered like a company in all aspects except its taxation. In this, it is treated like a partnership.
0037.00026; Therefore you have the limited liability, administrative and statutory obligations of a company but not the taxation and national insurance flexibility.
0037.00027; They are particularly suitable for medium and large-sized partnerships. Co-operative A co-operative is a mutual organisation owned by its employees.
0037.00028; One example of such an organisation is the John Lewis Partnership.
0037.00029; These structures need specialist advice.
0037.00030; How we can help If you are starting, or have recently started a business in  the Essex area we, at Baker Chapman, will be happy to discuss your plans and the most appropriate business structure with you.
0037.00031; The most  appropriate structure will depend on a number of factors including  consideration of taxation implications, the legal entity, ownership and  liability.

0038.00001; News  The moment Thomas Cook passengers raise thousands in whip-round for staff on Manchester flight Cabin crew members were left in tears at the incredible gesture  Share  By  Alexandra Rucki  07:38, 24 SEP 2019  News  Video Loading  Get the biggest daily stories by email  We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters. Staff told holidaymakers midway through the flight the company had collapsed and they did not know what would be happening to their jobs.
0038.00002; When the flight landed in Manchester a passenger organised a whip round, with two carrier bags filled with coins and notes handed to staff.
0038.00003; The crew were said to have been 'overwhelmed' by the gesture and burst into tears.
0038.00004; Soon as we landed a Scottish girl stands up- right folks I'm having a whip round get your money out £20 each! Passengers handed crew a bags stuffed with cash.
0038.00005; And if that's not the most Scottish thing ever I don't know what is was a joyful moment!
0038.00006; Got £5,000 apparently. Stephanie Kaye, 25, of Leeds, said the 326 passengers were made aware of the companies fate by the pilot - who told them that staff wouldn't be getting paid for the journey mid-air.
0038.00007; She said: When we got on the plane, the staff were really friendly and professional. One of the staff members made an announcement at the beginning of the journey to say they knew as much as we did, so please bear that in mind if you hear anything.
0038.00008; The chartered Atlas Air aircraft with around 300 Thomas Cook passengers on board  And she said, if you're that way inclined, please say a little prayer for us and it got a bit emotional as everyone started clapping.
0038.00009; Staff were so professional during the flight, they didn't mention it, but as soon as we landed, they got the news. At the end, the pilot came over on the tannoy and said 'That's the end of our dream.' Then, everyone clapped again and staff were in tears and thanking the passengers for making it a nice flight.
0038.00010; But towards the end of the journey, passengers had started a little collection but it ended being quite a big collection.
0038.00011; Everyone was putting in their remaining dollars and I think there was two bags going around so it turned out to be a lot of the money.
0038.00012; Staff were touched by the gesture  People were very generous, they were throwing in wads of dollars, it was two carriers bags worth of coins and notes.
0038.00013; And it got handed over at the end of the flight and staff came over the tannoy, they thanked us again for the support, and said how overwhelmed they were. It was really emotional, passengers were crying.
0038.00014; It's crazy that staff didn't know about it until landing.
0038.00015; The 25-year-old had driven from San Francisco to Las Vegas over two weeks with her partner Anouj Patel, 28 and arrived back at Manchester Airport this morning  She said: You could not have faulted the staff, they were great.

0038.00017; Passengers on a separate Thomas Cook flight, from Orlando, also donated money after an on-flight whip round.
0038.00018; A touching video of the generous passengers shows them praising the now-bust company staff for their honorable behaviour and wishing them good luck.
0038.00019; The passengers were lucky to have made their return flight after up to 150,000 Thomas Cook holiday makers have been left stranded abroad following the overnight collapse of the 178-year-old travel giant.
0038.00020; A staggering 22,000 jobs are now on the line, including 9,000 in the UK alone, after the company failed to secure a deal with creditors and shareholders that could plug a £250m gap in its finances.

0039.00001; View all news & insight items  It is common for contracts, such as shareholder agreements, commercial contracts and standard terms of business, to set out specific consequences for breach.
0039.00002; This might be, for example, a parking fine for overstaying in a car park, or a set fee for late payment of an invoice.
0039.00003; It is a long established principle in English law that where such clauses amount to a 'penalty', they will be unenforceable.
0039.00004; This principle has been restated and clarified by the Supreme Court in the recent cases, Cavendish Square Holding BV v El Makdessi and Parking Eye Ltd v Beavis. In Cavendish v El Makdessi, Mr Makdessi agreed to sell to Cavendish a controlling stake in a company.
0039.00005; The sale agreement contained a non-compete covenant which, if breached, provided that Mr Makdessi would not receive the two final instalments of the consideration and could be forced to sell his remaining shares at a reduced value.
0039.00006; On breach of the agreement by Mr Makdessi, he argued that these provisions amounted to an unenforceable penalty. In Parking Eye v Beavis, Mr Beavis overstayed in a car park in which there were signs stating that parking was free for two hours, but an £85 fine would be incurred thereafter.
0039.00007; Mr Beavis argued that the fine amounted to an unenforceable penalty.
0039.00008; In each case the relevant clauses were upheld as valid and enforceable. Exactly what amounts to a 'penalty clause' has been clarified.
0039.00009; The Supreme Court rejected an earlier test which suggested that the clause would be likely to be a penalty clause if it were intended to be a 'deterrent', or enforced the payment of a sum which was not a 'genuine pre-estimate of loss'.
0039.00010; The true test is whether the clause in question imposes a liability on the guilty party out of all proportion to any legitimate interest of the innocent party in enforcing the core terms of the contract.
0039.00011; The innocent party can have no proper interest in simply punishing the defaulter.
0039.00012; Who is impacted by this decision?
0039.00013; This decision affects anyone who might seek to rely on any clause which sets out a pre-determined consequence for a breach of a contract.
0039.00014; This could relate to, for example, being forced to a pay a pre-determined amount, losing the right to receive a pre-determined amount, or being forced to transfer an asset, such as shares.
0039.00015; Examples could include:  additional fees charged for breach of standard terms of business bad leaver provisions in a shareholder agreement (such as those forcing the sale of shares at below market value) and specified damages for breach of a non-competition covenant. While these cases provide some welcome clarity regarding the law in this area and arguably bring it more into line with the commercial realities of a modern business, a key 'take away' point for contracting parties is that, even where parties are of equal bargaining power, the freedom to contract is not unfettered.
0039.00016; Where the court deems a pre-determined consequence of breach as too harsh, it can still declare it to be unenforceable.
0039.00017; Given the subject matter of Cavendish, this point is particularly relevant to companies and individuals who are subject to, or rely on, default and non-compete provisions.

0040.00001; Select a state on the map and an action above to learn what the individual insurance market stabilization strategies states may be pursuing.
0040.00002; Download data tables  Notes: Section 1332 of the ACA authorizes states to apply to waive specified provisions of the health law to facilitate state-specific programs for improving coverage.
0040.00003; If a state's innovation waiver program is forecast to reduce federal spending, the state is entitled to have these savings passed through to it for purposes of implementing the program.
0040.00004; The states identified in this table have secured, or are seeking, approval for innovation waivers that use these federal pass-through funds to partially finance the state's reinsurance program.
0040.00005; Program funding and projected premium effects data are estimates and come from the states' Section 1332 waiver applications. For states with an approved waiver for which pass-through funding levels have been announced by the federal government, the federal share of program funding equals the federal pass-through funding for the year identified, as calculated by the federal government, divided by the total program funding, as estimated in the state's waiver application.
0040.00006; For these states, the state share of funding equals the difference of total program funding and federal funding.
0040.00007; For states with a pending waiver application, or with an approved application for which pass-through funding levels have not yet been announced, the respective funding shares are derived from information provided in the state's waiver application.
0040.00008; State reinsurance programs typically are designed following one of two broad models.
0040.00009; A condition-specific reinsurance program covers some or all of an insurer's claims costs that have been incurred by enrollees diagnosed with one more specified high-cost health conditions.
0040.00010; An attachment point reinsurance program covers some or all of an insurer's claims costs that exceed a specified threshold, or attachment point, regardless of the type of claim.
0040.00011; Note: The ACA requires most individuals to maintain minimum essential health coverage or pay a tax penalty (the individual mandate).
0040.00012; Recent changes in federal law, effective in 2019, reduce this tax penalty to $0, but do not repeal the underlying requirement to maintain coverage.
0040.00013; This graphic identifies states that require residents to maintain adequate health coverage -- whether or not the state imposes a penalty on individuals who fail to do so -- notwithstanding the elimination of the federal tax penalty.
0040.00014; Note: The ACA provides federal subsidies to reduce the cost of individual market health insurance for eligible individuals. Premium tax credits are available to otherwise eligible individuals with household income between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL) who enroll in coverage through an ACA marketplace, and cost-sharing subsidies are available to such individuals with incomes between 100% and 250% FPL who enroll in a silver tier plan.
0040.00015; This graphic identifies states that make available separate, state-funded subsidies to defray the cost of ACA-compliant individual market health coverage: for example, an additional premium subsidy for individuals receiving federal premium tax credits, or a subsidy for individual market consumers whose incomes render them ineligible for federal coverage assistance. Notes: Short-term policies are not subject to the federal consumer protections of the ACA.
0040.00016; Under federal regulations finalized in August 2018, short-term policies may provide coverage for a period of 364 days and may be renewed, at the discretion of the insurance company, for up to 36 months.
0040.00017; This table identifies states that, by limiting the maximum duration of short-term coverage to less than 364 days, or by applying state law consumer protections to such coverage, impose limitations on the sale of short-term plans than are more strict than those mandated under the default federal approach.
0040.00018; The states identified entirely prohibit short-term coverage or bar short-term insurers from discriminating on the basis of an applicant's health status.
0040.00019; A state is identified as having limited the initial contract duration of underwritten short-term coverage to less than 364 days if a short-term plan lasting longer than the specified duration would become subject to one or more of the following state consumer protections: guaranteed issue, guaranteed renewability, or required coverage of essential health benefits.
0040.00020; Such states typically impose limitations on the renewal of short-term policies, but, in most cases, do not prohibit insurers from issuing multiple new short-term policies consecutively. A state is identified as having limited the total length of time a consumer may be enrolled in underwritten short-term coverage to less than 364 days if it prohibits the issuance of multiple short-term policies consecutively, closing a loophole that otherwise may permit continuous enrollment in such plans. †Connecticut makes consecutive short-term policies subject to certain preexisting condition coverage requirements.
0040.00021; ††Hawaii also prohibits the issuance of a short-term policy to an individual who was eligible to purchase coverage through the ACA marketplace during an open or special enrollment period in the previous calendar year.
0040.00022; †††California prohibits the issuance of any health insurance policy with a duration of less than 12 months.
0040.00023; ‡Washington also prohibits the issuance of a short-term policy during the annual open enrollment period, for coverage beginning in the upcoming year.
0040.00024; ‡‡Delaware prohibits insurers from (1) issuing the same short-term policy to an enrollee for successive back-to-back terms and (2) from issuing a different short-term policy to the same individual more than once in any given year.
0040.00025; Note: Federal regulations established a 45-day open enrollment period for 2018 coverage beginning on November 1, 2017 and ending on December 15, 2017.
0040.00026; For 2019 coverage, the open enrollment window will again last 45 days, beginning on November 1, 2018 and ending on December 15, 2018.
0040.00027; The 11 states (and the District of Columbia) that operate their own ACA marketplaces and use their own enrollment platforms have authority to modify the federally-specified enrollment dates, including by lengthening the duration of the sign-up period. By contrast, the 39 states that use Healthcare.gov for enrollment do not have such authority.
0040.00028; This graphic identifies those states that extended the length of the 2018 open enrollment period beyond the 45-day federal default, or that plan to extend the duration of the 2019 enrollment period. While, as a formal matter, some of these states have provided for an extension by establishing a broadly available special enrollment period beginning on the day following the end of the federal default open enrollment window, the table identifies those states that, as a matter of practice, offer a continuous, broadly available enrollment period for next-year coverage than is longer than 45 days.
0040.00029; Note: This graphic identifies states that have adopted certain specific actions intended to promote a competitive ACA marketplace.
0040.00030; In particular, only those states that: (1) have merged their individual and small-group markets
0040.00031; (2) require that all individual market coverage be sold through the ACA marketplace or (3) leverage insurers' participation in state public health insurance programs, such as Medicaid, or state insurance markets to encourage or require participation in the ACA marketplace.
0040.00032; Other factors and state actions not identified here also may affect the competitiveness of a state's ACA marketplace.
0040.00033; Note: Transitional policies are those that were issued following the ACA's enactment in 2010 but before 2014.
0040.00034; These policies, also known as grandmothered plans, are required to meet some, but not all, of the ACA's individual market consumer protections.
0040.00035; In states where transitional policies are allowed, insurers may choose whether to continue to offer such policies.
0040.00036; In some states, transitional policies may no longer exist in the individual market, even though permitted under state law.
0040.00037; Table reflects state decisions as of December 31, 2018 such decisions govern transitional policies renewed on or before October 1, 2019.
0040.00038; State decisions regarding transitional policies renewed after October 1, 2019 are not reflected in this table.
0040.00039; The table identifies states that have established rules exempting certain health coverage products from federal and state insurance regulation.
0040.00040; These rules tend to encourage market segmentation and a deterioration of the ACA-compliant risk pool, thereby making comprehensive individual market coverage less affordable and accessible. States may have taken other actions that are likely to decrease access to affordable and adequate individual market coverage that are not identified in this table. For example, this table does not include state actions that may encourage the sale of, or broaden access to the following forms of coverage, which are not fully compliant with federal rules governing the individual market: short-term, limited duration insurance association health plans that meet the definition of a large-group plan under federal law transitional, or grandmothered health plans or coverage arrangements offered by a health care sharing ministry.

0041.00001; The legalization of hemp in the 2018 Farm Bill has opened many new opportunities for research by universities across the country. One example is that of the Oregon State University Global Hemp Innovation Center.
0041.00002; This program is the latest example of expansion into institutional hemp research, with their program tasked to advance the research of hemp and its market potential across multiple diverse industries and research fields to serve the growing international demand for innovative approaches to food, health, and fiber. Central to fueling new research and ensuring its validity is establishing standards for cannabinoid testing to guide farmers in the choosing of applicable genetics, setting planting/harvesting dates, and irrigation/fertilization rates.
0041.00003; Hemp is comprised of over 100 different cannabiniods in both acidic and activated forms.
0041.00004; An example of this is THCA, which when heated or decarboxolated, transforms into Delta-9 THC (the only known intoxicating molecule in the cannabis plant).
0041.00005; Although most hemp currently being grown in the United States is cultivated for its high CBDA/CBD content, new genetics are being created for their reported beneficial effects  -  for example CBGA/CBG for inflammation, CBNA/CBN for sleep, THCVA/THCV for appetite suppression, and CBCA/CBC for nootropics.
0041.00006; The focus on these genetics has been due to their higher market value for their varying uses in the health food industry.
0041.00007; As research continues on the various therapeutic uses for hemp, it is imperative to have a testing platform that can give accurate values for both the acidic and activated cannabinoids.
0041.00008; Currently the two acceptable primary testing platforms used to test hemp are high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC).
0041.00009; However, gas chromatography  -  unlike HPLC  -  heats and alters the test sample causing the acids to turn into their activated forms.
0041.00010; HPLC maintains the integrity of the sample at its current chemical state offering a true value of potency in a sample. Hemp is sold based on the percentage value of cannabinoids contained in the raw material.
0041.00011; Without a consistent platform standard that provides accurate cannabinoid values farmers and extractors are going to suffer from instability in the markets.
0041.00012; HPLC has been written into law an allowed testing platform in both Texas and South Carolina.
0041.00013; If one were to choose a single testing technology method to standardize deployment across the country, HPLC appears to be a solid choice.
0041.00014; Either way, it is imperative that testing is standardized across research to ensure the validity of findings and allow for cross-comparisons between outcomes.
0042.00001; Little Haiti, Corn Pop, Capote and Lee: News from around our 50 states From USA TODAY Network and wire reports  Published 3:50 AM EDT Sep 17, 2019  Monroeville: A new play about the relationship between Alabama authors Truman Capote and Harper Lee will have its debut performances in their hometown. Truman Talks Nelle Harper Lee is set to premiere at the old Monroe County courthouse Sept. 27. It runs through Sept. 29.
0042.00002; The play was written and is performed by Broadway actor Joel Vig, who was in the original Broadway production of Hairspray.
0042.00003; Capote and Lee grew up together in Monroeville and remained friends throughout much of their lives as writers.
0042.00004; The play is about a fictional surprise birthday party for Lee.
0042.00005; Performing as Capote, Vig tells stories about Lee and his relationship with her.
0042.00006; Lee helped Capote research his best-known work, In Cold Blood, and authored the landmark novel To Kill a Mockingbird. Rip, a 2-year old reindeer, basks in the morning sunshine on a chilly morning at the Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks in 2005. Eric Engman/Fairbanks Daily News-Miner via AP  Fairbanks: All but two of the University of Alaska Fairbanks Experiment Farm reindeer herd have moved amid budget cuts and program changes.
0042.00007; Thirty-five of the reindeer were moved to a bison farm near Delta Junction two weeks ago, the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reports. The farm, owned by the Stevens Village Native Council, has been working with the reindeer program for a number of years.
0042.00008; Milan Shipka, director of the UAF Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station, says the move will help the farm develop a larger herd for meat production. This was an opportunity to help an Alaska Native entity develop a red meat industry, Shipka says.
0042.00009; The remaining reindeer, Roger and Olivia, have been moved to the Large Animal Research Station near the UAF campus.
0042.00010; The pair will be used for outreach.
0042.00011; Phoenix: Emergency dispatchers who handle 911 calls are about to have a place to decompress.
0042.00012; The Phoenix Police Department on Tuesday will dedicate a new quiet room for 911 operators. Police Chief Jeri Williams and Mayor Kate Gallego will be on hand for the ceremony.
0042.00013; A local Rotary Club came up with the idea as a way to show appreciation to police communications operators.
0042.00014; Officials say the job of emergency dispatcher can sometimes take an emotional toll.
0042.00015; The quiet room will allow the workers a place to rest or take a few moments for themselves. More than a dozen Patrol Packs sit on the sidewalk in front of the Baxter County Sheriff's Office on Thursday.
0042.00016; AT&T is providing the food kits to the Sheriff's Office for deputies to hand out while on patrol. Scott Liles/The Baxter Bulletin  Mountain Home: Patrol Packs  -  bags of easy-to-prepare grocery items meant to be given out to those facing food insecurity  -  are now part of the arsenal of the Baxter County Sheriff's Department.
0042.00017; Cathy Foraker, director of external affairs for AT&T Arkansas, recently delivered the first 25 Patrol Packs to the sheriff's office.
0042.00018; The packages are assembled and donated by AT&T through its Believe Arkansas program to combat hunger. The Sheriff's Office has the Patrol Packs installed in its patrol vehicles, Sheriff John Montgomery says.
0042.00019; We run into people on a regular basis (that are food insecure), he says.
0042.00020; We're excited to try this, and I think it can make a difference. The Patrol Packs contain items like peanut butter, easy-to-make skillet dinners, macaroni and cheese, pouches of tuna and easy-to-open canned goods.
0042.00021; Sacramento: Sacramento State University has accidentally accepted 3,500 waitlisted students for fall admission.
0042.00022; The Sacramento Bee reports the students were mistakenly invited to Admitted Students Day after an email was sent in March welcoming them to the event.
0042.00023; Officials say the school never rescinded the invitation, which implied the students were accepted. University officials say the error resulted in an additional 500 students who began classes this semester.
0042.00024; Officials say there was space to admit them because the school initially admitted a conservative number of students, and it noted a record number of graduates last year. Officials say they don't believe the additional students will have an effect on students' ability to take classes in their department. University officials estimate a 1% enrollment increase.
0042.00025; Denver: The number of children and teens killed by gun violence in the Mile-High City is rising, and so is the number of youth charged with gun-related crimes.
0042.00026; The Denver Post reports 15 teens and children have been shot and killed in the city since January 2018, more than in the previous three years combined.
0042.00027; Prosecutors say 107 teens were charged with gun possession in 2018, compared with 50 in 2015.
0042.00028; They say this year is on pace to equal or surpass last year.
0042.00029; Law enforcement officers, community members and health officials point to a variety of possible reasons for the increase in gun violence against young people.
0042.00030; They include changing gang structures, easy access to firearms, violent video games, socioeconomic inequality, hopelessness and an online culture that glorifies gun possession.
0042.00031; Hartford: Gov.
0042.00032; Ned Lamont is recommending the state join a growing number of counterparts in eliminating the religious exemption to childhood vaccinations. The Democrat and state Health Commissioner Renee Coleman-Mitchell on Monday proposed the General Assembly do away with the exemption by the start of the 2021-22 school year. The decision follows the recent release of state Health Department statistics showing the percentage of Connecticut kindergarteners who were vaccinated against measles and mumps dropped from 96.5% in the 2017-18 school year to 95.9% in the 2018-19 school year.
0042.00033; Lamont and Coleman-Mitchell were joined by leaders of the Legislature's Democratic majority, who called the repeal a public-safety issue during the nation's worst measles outbreak in decades.
0042.00034; The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1905 that states have the right to enforce compulsory vaccination laws.
0042.00035; Former Vice President Joe Biden sits in the lifeguard chair and cheers along with the crowd as they reveal the renaming of the pool facility being dedicated in his honor to the Joseph R. Biden Jr. Aquatic Center. Suchat Pederson/The News Journal  Wilmington: Yes, Corn Pop is a real person.
0042.00036; Over the weekend, a clip of presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden recalling his time as a local lifeguard in the 1960s went viral. He was speaking in Wilmington in 2017, when the pool where he worked as a college student was being named after him.
0042.00037; At the time, he was the only white lifeguard at the pool.
0042.00038; The clip made many people wonder on Twitter who Corn Pop is and if the incident actually occurred. In short, William L. Williams was very much a real person.
0042.00039; He died in 2016, and his nickname, Corn Pop, was included in his short obituary in the Delaware News Journal.
0042.00040; Williams was associated with the Romans, a Wilmington gang prominent in the 1960s.
0042.00041; Former Mayor Dennis Williams confirmed to CNN that Corn Pop was as real as the moon in the sky. Washington: The next acting chief of the U.S. Park Police is accused of using his role to improperly have criminal charges dropped against defendants, including some accused of assaulting officers.
0042.00042; News outlets report a complaint filed Friday by the Fraternal Order of Police details the allegations.
0042.00043; Gregory T. Monahan is set to take on the role this week.
0042.00044; He previously worked for the department's San Francisco office while based in D.C.
0042.00045; The complaint says Monahan twice intervened to have charged dropped against San Francisco employees of Presidio Trust, a federal agency that helps fund San Francisco's park police through partnerships with other organizations.
0042.00046; Its chief executive, Jean S. Fraser, is accused of asking Monahan to drop the charges.
0042.00047; Murals adorn a wall next to a vacant lot in the Little Haiti neighborhood of Miami.
0042.00048; Lynne Sladky/AP  Miami: A billion-dollar development project set to be built in a cultural neighborhood has divided residents.
0042.00049; Magic City Innovation District is taking up 17 acres of land in historic Little Haiti, which once had the most Haitians outside of Haiti. The project has inspired hope and fear amongst residents.
0042.00050; Leonie Hermantin, a Little Haiti community leader, says she is cautiously optimistic.
0042.00051; She hopes the project will bring economic benefits to an impoverished neighborhood but is wary of longtime residents being displaced due to rising house costs. Hermantin says her support for the project has lost her many friends, but allying with what she calls an unstoppable process is better to ensure residents can be protected and for the neighborhood to thrive.

0042.00058; Wailuku: State and federal agencies have approved an energy company's request to increase incidental bat deaths at its Maui wind farm. The Maui News reports the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the state Department of Land and Natural Resources have allowed Auwahi Wind Energy to increase the number of hoary bat deaths by 2037 to 140, up from the 21 bats in its original application.
0042.00059; Officials say Auwahi applied for a federal permit, which was prepared and signed Sept. 3, but decisions must be published in the Federal Register to be made final.

0042.00156; Albany: Schools across the state began the academic year with a new tool intended to prevent student suicides and violence  -  the ability to ask a court to remove a troubled person's access to firearms. So-called red flag laws allow courts to temporarily seize guns from people believed to be a danger to themselves or others, but New York is the first to empower schools to petition a court themselves for such an order, rather than go through local law enforcement. Supporters of the law say educators are uniquely suited to pick up on the kind of troubling behavior seen before school shootings.
0042.00157; With the law so new, though, schools are still crafting procedures or waiting on guidance to help them figure out when and how to take action if the need arises.
0042.00158; Several school systems said they're not yet sure what the law will look like in action.

0042.00164; But critics say the e-pulltabs are simply slot machines in disguise that take away profits from the state's American Indian casinos and have caused problem gambling to soar.
0042.00165; Lisa Vig, who helps run a gambling treatment program in Fargo, called the machines' popularity very frightening.
0042.00166; She says the e-machines are contributing greatly to financial distress, emotional distress and family issues. Baby snow leopard Babochka explores her new area at the Toledo Zoo on Friday in Toledo, Ohio.

0042.00223; The state auditor's report found that students who sit for 20 minutes wasted less food, ate healthier and exhibited better behavior in the classroom. But the report also found students at nearly all of the 31 schools observed didn't sit for 20 minutes to eat.
0042.00224; Seventeen schools scheduled 20 minutes of sitting, but only one followed through.
0042.00225; Enforcing the rule can be tough.
0042.00226; Teachers are required to have a break from supervising students, and some schools don't have enough support staff to keep kids in their seats.
0042.00227; Wheeling: A private university will reinstate several academic and athletic programs that were dropped amid a financial crisis. Wheeling University says in a statement that starting in January, it will resume offering majors in biology, engineering science and English.

0042.00229; In 2020, the school will reinstate men's golf, men's and women's lacrosse, and men's and women's swimming.
0042.00230; Wheeling University athletic teams compete in the Division II Mountain East Conference.
0042.00231; Wheeling University cut more than half its academic programs this fall, and two top officials were placed on paid administrative leave.

A farmer spreads cow manure in a field near Granton, Wis., in 2009. Dan Young/The Marshfield News-Herald via AP  Madison: The state's dairy industry is raising a stink about potential new regulations governing manure storage.
0042.00233; State officials are crafting new farm standards to serve as a template for local ordinances. The standards would expand setbacks for manure storage. New farms with at least 500 animals and farms looking to expand to at least 500 animals would have to place storage facilities between 600 feet and 2,500 feet from their neighbors' property line depending on herd size to minimize odor.
0042.00234; Farm groups including the Dairy Business Association, the Wisconsin Dairy Alliance and the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation held a news conference Monday to rail against the standards. They insisted the regulations would make expansion nearly impossible and drive farmers out of Wisconsin.
0042.00235; Yellowstone National Park: The park recorded just over 820,000 recreational visits during the month of August and has exceeded 3.1 million visitors for the year so far.
0042.00236; The August numbers are a slight increase from August 2018, while the total visitor numbers for the year are down by about 21,500 from the same period last year. Visitation to the United States' first national park typically begins to decrease in September with the end of the busy summer tourist season and the onset of winter.

0045.00001; Ali Hall and Julie Lavington  News |  September 23 2019  |  Write a comment  An online fashion firm founded by two former journalists says investments in marketing are starting to pay dividends.
0045.00002; Sosandar was launched by Ali Hall and Julie Lavington three years ago and is aimed at women looking for higher quality fashion items. The Cheshire based firm has enjoyed considerable success and has also been boosted by a number of celebrity endorsements. Celebrities seen wearing Sosandar clothing include Zoe Ball, Susanna Reid, Melanie Sykes and Amanda Holden.
0045.00003; This summer the firm raised £7m through a placing of new shares. Sosandar was launched in September 2016 and the business model is built around using trend-led, exclusive designs produced in-house and then manufactured using a variety of global suppliers.
0045.00004; Bill Murray, non-executive chairman, will update to shareholders attending the annual general meeting today. He said: It has been an exciting time of growth and development for Sosandar. As we approach the end of the first half of the current financial year, I am delighted to report that the increased investment we've made into marketing and product is producing very good results.
0045.00005; Following the completion of our oversubscribed placing in July, we have accelerated our growth by carefully deploying funds to strengthen our design capability, widen our product range and trial additional marketing channels. As expected, we've seen these activities result in increased customer acquisition alongside continued growth from our ever-expanding base of loyal existing customers.
0045.00006; He added: The important autumn period has only just begun but results for the first half of September have been very strong, and midway through September revenue has already exceeded that achieved in September last year.
0046.00001; BONN (Reuters) - A British investment banker at the center of Germany's biggest fraud trial told judges on Thursday he earned millions of euros from deals involving astronomical trades that prosecutors say were a means to make bogus tax reclaims.
0046.00002; FILE PHOTO: State Prosecutor Anne Brorhilker before the trial of two British bankers accused of involvement in fraudulent Cum-Ex tax rebates at a court in Bonn, Germany, September 4, 2019. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay/File Photo  Martin Shields, a former investment banker, said the trading, known as cum ex, thrived between 2005 and 2012, as investors from around the globe made multi-billion-euro trades on German companies. That allowed them generate multiple tax reclaims. The trial where Shields is giving detailed evidence is the first in a wider investigation aimed at recovering billions from banks which prosecutors believe profited from the trades.
0046.00003; Prosecutors allege that players in the cum-ex scheme misled the state into thinking a stock had multiple owners who were each owed a dividend and a tax credit. Germany estimates such trades cost it more than 5 billion euros ($5.5 billion) in total.
0046.00004; The number of trades going through the market was astronomical, Shields told the court, adding that he had earned 12 million euros from the trades that are now at the center of the criminal trial in Bonn.
0046.00005; Trades regularly exceeded 100% of the (company's) market capitalization, said the 41-year-old engineering graduate, as he told the court of the circular trades, one version of which was known among traders by the synonym Guts Spread.
0046.00006; German state prosecutor Anne Brorhilker this month outlined criminal charges against Shields and fellow British banker Nicholas Diable, who she said organized a network of traders and lenders to make double tax reclaims with sham share trades.
0046.00007; Brorhilker said the two men, who face a possible jail term and a state order to repay profits they made, had targeted companies including carmaker BMW and airline Lufthansa.
0046.00008; Brorhilker has outlined more than 30 instances of double-tax reclaims totaling 447 million euros.
0046.00009; Shields' 12 million euros of earnings relate to those deals.
0046.00010; The alleged scheme involved trading shares rapidly around a syndicate of banks, investors and hedge funds to give the impression of numerous owners, each entitled to a tax rebate.
0046.00011; Shields used the metaphor of receiving presents and cake in describing how the trade worked, although he said he refused to get involved in more ambitious such schemes that amounted to looping shares to create a (tax) voucher printing machine.
0046.00012; Shields said the trades involved were so vast that it caused financial market mishaps because it was often not possible to find and match buyers and sellers in time.
0046.00013; He said those manifested themselves in difficulties at Deutsche Boerse's share trade settlement arm Clearstream.
0046.00014; A spokesman for Deutsche Boerse, which was raided in connection with the wider investigation, said it was cooperating with the authorities.
0046.00015; Shields' testimony is a critical building block in pursuing others potentially involved.
0046.00016; The case, Germany's biggest post-war fraud investigation, is being closely followed in London and Frankfurt, where much of the trading was organized, according to bankers and court documents. Diable is expected to address the court next week.
0046.00017; His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.
0046.00018; Germany changed and clarified the law in 2007, 2009 and 2012 to prevent cum-ex trades but it been criticized for failing to shut it down faster.
0046.00019; Reporting By John O'Donnell Editing by Jon Boyle  Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
0047.00001; The key focus areas of this report are Payments, Remittance, Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
0047.00002; With the recent advances and implementations in aforementioned areas and collaboration between banks and FinTech startups there is some incredible technology development shaping new financial services experiences.
0047.00003; A brief primer on each of these areas of focus is given below: '¢  PAYMENTS - 2017 has been the year of instant digital payments, aligned with the emergence of alternative payments. With mobile payments (P2P and merchant payments) reaching higher adoption levels in the mainstream, traditional payment methods are slowly taking the back seat.
0047.00004; In 2018, global payments revenue are expected to reach $2.3 trillion, representing 43% of banking revenues.
0047.00005; '¢  REMITTANCE - In 2016, worldwide remittance flows were estimated at $575.2 billion, which was significantly below the previous forecasts.
0047.00006; Developing countries are estimated to receive about $439 billion, which is nearly three times the amount of official development assistance.
0047.00007; '¢  BLOCKCHAIN - 70% of banks have already initiated or in the process of initiating DLT projects in 2017. Blockchain in areas of Audit, Insurance, Capital Markets and cross border money transfer may see more production ready use cases.
0047.00008; '¢  AI - Five AI technology systems: robotics and autonomous vehicles, computer vision, language, virtual agents, and machine learning, which includes deep learning underpins the recent advances in the other AI technologies. With wallets, P2P and mobile payments reaching high adoption levels in the mainstream, traditional payment methods are slowly taking the back seat.
0047.00009; '¢ In 2016-17, digital payments reached the market size of $3.6 Trillion in terms of transactions. This saw an 20% YOY growth from 2015-16 and 60% of this growth can be attribute to the contactless cards segment.
0047.00010; '¢ Key drivers for the growing adoption of alternative payments are financial inclusion, smartphone/internet penetration, cashless initiatives in large economies like India, and emergence of attractive digital payment solutions by FinTech.
0047.00011; Contactless cards are growing in adoption, with mature markets leading the way. Over the next five years, payment cards are expected to account for 90% of the overall contactless payments. Global value of contactless POS terminal payments is expected to be $500bn in 2017, a 55% growth since 2016.
0047.00012; Smartphone penetration has disrupted the emerging markets by enabling financial inclusion at a large scale, through the mobile money services.
0047.00013; In 20 countries of SubSaharan Africa and Asia, mobile money penetration is much higher than banking penetration. APAC is leading in the mobile payments adoption race with the increasing ubiquity of smartphones .
0047.00014; China is clearly the global leader in this space with a market size of $5.5 Tn in 2016 and is expected to reach $8 Tn in 2017.
0047.00015; Alipay and WeChat are shaping the way payments are done in China, and thus are guiding the global trends. Emerging markets lead the way in mobile/digital payments growth, with many countries adopting the mobile first payment strategy. Mature markets grew at a steady but subdued rate.
0047.00016; '¢ Increasing tech-savvy millennial population, need for superior customer experience, ease-of-payment, downward pressure on  interchange fees from card processors by merchants and the cheaper/faster alternative being offered by ubiquitous FinTech in major markets are driving the adoption of digital payments. APIs driving innovation '¢ APIs are enabling FinTech to provide easy to use front end solutions leveraging banking platform and infrastructure. '¢ Open APIs are gaining traction in Indian FinTech and banking space, fuelled by Aadhar, e-KYC, UPI and other such government initiatives.
0047.00017; Mobile / Digital Wallets '¢ The growing smartphone and internet adoption is enabling widespread use of mobile/e-wallets as a payment tool.
0047.00018; '¢ India has seen a rise in mobile wallet adoption since the demonetization measures adopted on November 8, 2016.
0047.00019; '¢ New Payments Platform (NPP) is being implemented in Australia which introduce instant payments in the low-value arena. This will come into operation by the end of 2017. '¢ Pan European SEPA Instant Credit Transfer Scheme will go live in November 2017.

'¢ Developing countries are estimated to receive about $439 billion, which is nearly three times the amount of official development assistance. '¢ However, the true size of remittances, including unrecorded flows through formal and informal channels, is believed to be significantly larger.
0047.00021; The recent developments like taxation of remittance flows and exchange controls in several countries are giving rise to the high premium black forex market. '¢ The cost of sending remittance ($200) remained flat at 7.45% in Q1, 2017 which is well above the sustainable development goal (SGD) of 3%. However this is expected to go further down with the rise of modern FinTech players providing low cost online/mobile remittance service.
0047.00022; '¢ Sub Saharan African region has the highest cost of remittance due to lack of infrastructure. However with the evolution of mobile money services, this scenario is changing dynamically.
0047.00023; '¢ Over the last few years, technology driven new age FinTech players have taken the online and mobile route to deliver low cost, high speed remittance service, thus bringing down the average cost of sending remittances and providing the increasingly digital-savvy customers a much better experience.
0047.00024; '¢ Identifying a huge opportunity owing to heavy costs of remittances in emerging markets such as Sub Saharan Africa, increasing number of FinTech players have begun to operate in African corridors by partnering with Mobile Money services.
0047.00025; E.g. WorldRemit has partnered with all four leading MNOs in Tanzania.
0047.00026; '¢ 2017 has seen the focus increasing on SMEs and B2B remittances. Payoneer is one of the leaders in this space. Also, TransferWise launched their B2B offering in 2017.
0047.00027; '¢ Many start ups (Abra, Veem, Tempo etc.) are moving towards leveraging the blockchain technology by partnering with platforms such as Stellar, Ripple etc.
0047.00028; Large players like UAE Exchange is also joining the blockchain bandwagon and looking to extend their dominance over the global market by partnering with Ripple.
0047.00029; In 2016, the remittance volumes declined by 2.4%, following the 1% dip in 2015.
0047.00030; '¢  This decline can be attributed to a number of global economic factors which include but are not limited to ' Low oil prices, weak economic growth in GCC, Russia and European region, weakening of Euro, Pound and Ruble against US etc.
0047.00031; '¢  Remittance flows to the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region registered a significant decline for the third consecutive year.
0047.00032; On the other hand, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) was the only region to register an increase (6.9%) in remittance flows, supported by strengthening employment levels in the United States.
0047.00033; '¢  However, Recent indicators suggest that economic activity in high-income and developing economies has firmed up, supporting a positive outlook for 2017/18. '¢  The de-risking/withdrawal of correspondent banking relationships due to regulatory stringencies arising from AML/CFT norms in high risk geographies is impacting the remittance services across the world as small banks and MTOs are struggling to hold on to their Nostro accounts. This may result in high cost of sending remittances, and thus might cause a slight dip in the remittance flow to these geographies.
0047.00034; '¢  In 2015-16 there was a sudden increase in the number of undocumented migrants globally. (1.4 Million in 2015 to 16.5 Million in 2016).
0047.00035; '¢  Mobile money-based global remittances are growing at a fast pace, especially in East Africa and South Asia, with the proliferation of smartphones, which make online transfers more convenient and cheaper.
0047.00036; In addition, mobile money services have partnered with traditional remittance providers and digitalfirst startups, providing an alternative to traditional cash-to-cash models and offering instant online money transfers to mobile accounts.

0050.00001; an hour ago 6 hours ago If you invested $1,000 in McDonald's 10 years ago, here's how much money you'd have now Published 16 min ago Oliver Berg | picture alliance | Getty Images McDonald's has recently upped its drive-thru tech , taken a stance on harassment in the workplace and partnered with delivery service GrubHub . As the company continues to reinvent itself, not only is it good for business, but it's also proven to be a positive for longtime shareholders. If you invested in McDonald's 10 years ago, that decision would have paid off.
0050.00002; A $1,000 investment in 2009 would be worth more than $5,000 as of Sept. 20, 2019, for a total return of around 400%, according to CNBC calculations.
0050.00003; In the same time frame, by comparison, the S&P 500 earned a total return of nearly 250%. The fast-food giant, which went public in 1965, has a current share price around $212. While McDonald's stock has done well over the years, any individual stock can over- or underperform and past returns do not predict future results.
0050.00004; CNBC: McDonald's stock as of September.
0050.00005; How McDonald's reinvents its brand Although the company has been around for decades, McDonald's continues to innovate. To enhance its drive-thru experience, the company recently agreed to acquire Apprente , a Silicon Valley-based artificial intelligence company.
0050.00006; In March, it began installing technology from Dynamic Yield, another recent acquisition , into more than 8,000 drive-thru machines around the U.S. The machine learning tech allows menus to change based on the time of day, restaurant traffic, weather and the customer's order.
0050.00007; That isn't the first time McDonald's has given stores a tech revamp: In June 2018, the burger chain began adding self-order kiosks at 1,000 restaurants per quarter.
0050.00008; When it comes to delivery service, McDonald's recently partnered with GrubHub and its sister brand Seamless to offer delivery from around 500 locations in New York City and the tri-state area. McDonald's has its eyes set on making delivery a $4 billion business this year.
0050.00009; The burger chain is also taking steps to mitigate its environmental impact: Last week, McDonald's announced that select locations in the U.K. and Ireland will test out giving kids the option to choose a fruit pack rather than a plastic toy when ordering a Happy Meal.
0050.00010; And early next year, it plans to introduce books in place of its traditional children's meal toys, Reuters reports .
0050.00011; Its decision to test no-toy meals comes in response to criticism it received earlier this year over the distribution of plastic toys. In Britain, two young girls, Ella and Caitlin McEwan, first created a Change.org petition eight months ago calling for McDonald's and one of its biggest rivals, Burger King, to stop giving out plastic toys in order to protect the environment.
0050.00012; The future of McDonald's Many consumers wonder if McDonald's will join its competitors in adding meatless options to its lineup.
0050.00013; But the answer is still up in the air: In May, McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook said on CNBC's Squawk on the Street that he needs to know whether adding plant-based options will be good for business before doing so. When you look at the whole meat-substitute type ideas, I think what will be interesting for us will be to see who is particularly interested in that, Easterbrook said.
0050.00014; Is it an existing customer who just wants an alternative option does it bring a new customer in?
0050.00015; During the segment, Easterbrook compared McDonald's dilemma over meatless menu items to the difficult decisions the company had to make in 2015 when adding all-day breakfast to the menu.
0050.00016; Specifically, Easterbrook cites the complexity involved when adding new menu items given the huge number of people McDonald's serves daily. With all-day breakfast, same-store sales increased for several consecutive quarters, but competitors were quick to jump on the breakfast bandwagon and add to their selections, CNBC reports .
0050.00017; As a result, McDonald's ultimately decided in 2019 to scale back all-day breakfast options in an effort to make service more efficient . Even without plant-based patty options, the business remains successful. Over the past year, its stock grew a healthy 28% .
0050.00018; However, despite McDonald's stock reaching a record high this summer , traders seem to be on the fence about investing in the company.
0050.00019; While he refers to McDonald's as a great stock, Joseph Terranova, a senior managing director at Virtus Investment Partners, said recently on CNBC's Halftime Report that he's currently hanging on nervously to McDonald's given the recent downturn in its share price. If this continues, he says the company's shareholders may feel pressure to sell. If you are considering getting into investing , experts such as Warren Buffett often advise starting with index funds , which hold groups of stocks, such as names from the S&P 500.
0050.00020; Since index funds fluctuate with the market, they're less risky than individual stocks, making them a safer choice for beginners.
0050.00021; Buffett has also been known to give two general pieces of advice to investors.
0050.00022; First, he says to invest in companies that have long-term value.
0050.00023; Second, he advises investing in businesses you understand.
0050.00024; In his annual shareholders' letter from 1996 , Buffet wrote: What an investor needs is the ability to correctly evaluate selected businesses.
0050.00025; Note that word 'selected': You don't have to be an expert on every company, or even many. You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence.

We continue to deliver strong underlying organic growth, albeit tempered in revenue terms during the period by macro headwinds and their impact on average usage levels, said co-chief executives Steve Flavell and Michael Hughes in the results statement on Tuesday.
0051.00002; Macroeconomic conditions, including Brexit worries and slowing global growth sparked by US trade policy, hit LoopUp by reducing the number of meetings per user, with a 7% fall to 3,147 minutes per active user. The directors therefore said they considered it prudent to trim full-year 2019 guidance to revenue growth of roughly 26% and EBITDA margins of approximately 15%. This is based on the cautious assumption that the headwinds worsen during the second half before stabilising during the coming year.
0051.00003; Operationally, it was a half of much progress, with major enhancements to the product, the launch of the new Event product, the extension of its operations into the US with new offices in Chicago, Dallas and LA, and an agreement to consolidate its two London offices into a new single London headquarters in Shoreditch from December.
0051.00004; We have a loyal customer base that is highly engaged with our product and that is growing in spite of challenging macro headwinds, and we continue to invest in our efficient distribution engine to accelerate growth, Flavell and Hughes said. We adjust our guidance for due caution in uncertain times, but remain excited and confident in our team's and product's ability to generate future growth.

0053.00001; THE founding family of Hupsteel Limited has received enough valid acceptances of its offer to delist the group.
0053.00002; It had launched a voluntary conditional cash offer of S$1.20 per share on July 19.
0053.00003; As at the close of the offer at 5.30pm on Sept 13, the total number of shares owned or agreed to be acquired by the offeror and concert parties, as well as the valid acceptances of the offer, resulted in a shareholding of 95.5 per cent.
0053.00004; As this causes the public float to fall below 10 per cent, trading of shares in the steel trader will be suspended. The offeror, Hercules Pte Ltd, a bid vehicle for the consortium members, does not intend to restore the float.

0054.00002; (Photo by Rashah McChesney/Alaska's Energy Desk)  A new Alaska group hopes to overhaul the state's oil and gas tax credit system through a ballot initiative called the Fair Share Act, a report said.
0054.00003; The group hopes to enact the proposal into law in 2020, The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported Tuesday.
0054.00004; If approved, the group would need to collect at least 28,501 signatures, or 10% of the number of voters in the last general election.
0054.00005; Group member Robin Brena said the initiative would only apply to three of the state's large oil fields.
0054.00006; Prudhoe Bay, Alpine and Kuparuk produced an average daily minimum of 40,000 barrels of oil in the last calendar year, she said.
0054.00007; The initiative would increase the gross minimum production tax for those fields from the current 4% to 10%.
0054.00008; It would also increase the 10% minimum by 1%, up to a maximum of 15%, for each $5 per-barrel increase in the price of oil beginning at $50 per barrel.
0054.00009; The initiative would require publication of production tax returns for the fields.
0054.00010; In order to be a fair share, it needs to be fair to the industry and it needs to be fair to Alaskans, Brena said.
0054.00011; Right now, it's not fair to Alaskans.

0056.00001; According to the lawsuit, employees  -  who faced aggressive sales quotas  -  were taught and actively encouraged to convert $35 activation fees that customers paid to upgrade their phones into the price for multiple DirecTV Now subscriptions.
0056.00002; This was allegedly executed by waiving the fee, but charging the customer anyway, and applying the payment to up to three DirecTV Now accounts using fake email addresses.
0056.00003; The complaint claims customers were not told they had been signed up for a subscription, and that the company is said to have fielded regular complaints from customers who said that they were billed for accounts they did not sign up for.
0056.00004; The complaint also details other alleged methods for increasing subscriptions without clients' consent.
0056.00005; The purpose of these efforts, the lawsuit alleges, was to create the false impression that the service was compensating for declines in the legacy DirecTV satellite business, and to help justify the company's acquisition of Time Warner, now called WarnerMedia. WarnerMedia is CNN's parent company. CNN Business asked AT&T to respond to the merits of the lawsuit as well as for comment on specific allegations within it, such as claims the company pressured employees by setting aggressive sales targets and that employees were encouraged to use unrelated fees to create DirecTV Now accounts.
0056.00006; We plan to fight these baseless claims in court, AT&T said in a statement in response.
0056.00007; Plaintiffs include Local 449, a union pension fund based in Pittsburgh, and Melvin Gross, an investor who exchanged Time Warner stock for AT&T stock as part of the acquisition.
0056.00008; DirecTV Now, which AT&T launched in late 2016, was billed as a key part of the company's pivot to entertainment. The lawsuit alleges that executives, including CEO Randall Stephenson, were deceitful in claiming that DirecTV Now's growth was stable, and that it was driven by organic demand and only limited promotions.
0056.00009; But beyond the alleged inflation of subscriber numbers at unwitting consumers' expense, the service also suffered from significant turnover as customers jumped from one discounted streaming service to another, according to the complaint.
0056.00010; The complaint says the plaintiffs and their attorneys spoke with a number of current or former AT&T employees who gave information about the alleged scheme. It refers to one former employee in Michigan who allegedly estimated that around 40% to 50% of the customers he dealt with starting in early 2017 complained of being billed for DirecTV Now subscriptions that they said they had not signed up for.
0056.00011; The allegations come at what is for several reasons a delicate time for the company. Stephenson just recently elevated WarnerMedia CEO John Stankey to a position that puts Stankey in line to succeed Stephenson should he retire.
0056.00012; (Stankey is not alleged in the complaint to have personally misled investors, but the complaint does allege that he should have known investors were being misled.)
0056.00013; WarnerMedia plans to next year release its own streaming service, HBO Max, into a crowded market at a price higher than many of its competitors, including Disney+ and Netflix, will charge.
0056.00014; And Elliott Management, an activist hedge fund that has taken a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T, is demanding changes , including possibly spinning off DirecTV entirely.
0056.00015; The firm specifically called out DirecTV Now in a recent letter to AT&T's board, calling the service poorly executed and pointing to its declining subscriber base.
0056.00016; At the end of the fourth quarter of last year, AT&T reported that DirecTV Now had 1.6 million customers.
0056.00017; It had 1.3 million as of July, according to its earnings report for the second quarter.
0056.00018; Speaking on Tuesday at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia conference, Stephenson responded to criticism that the company is too big and paid too much for its media businesses.
0056.00019; It still makes sense for the company to own both a big wireless network and content, he said.

0057.00001; Fintan O'Toole: Michael O'Leary's golden ticket is for a ride to nowhere Fintan O'Toole: Revolt against staggering bonus shows culture of 'incentives' running out of road July 31st, 2019: Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has told staff in a video message that as many as 1,500 jobs are at risk at the airline due to a slump in earnings, Brexit concerns and delays to expansion plans.
0057.00002; Video: Ryanair  Last week in Dublin there was nearly another Rising. Almost half of Ryanair's shareholders, led by the representatives of pension funds, made a stand against one of the most egregious indulgences of sheer greed ever seen in Ireland.
0057.00003; The airline's board proposed a pay package for its chief executive Michael O'Leary, including a potential bonus of €99 million within five years.
0057.00004; The poor man has had his current pay and annual bonus halved to a total maximum of a mere €1 million a year.
0057.00005; However, he will have an option to buy 10 million shares at a fixed price of €11.12 a share, should the airline either record a profit of €2 billion in any one year to 2024, or should the share price rise above €21  -  in which case he gets his staggering bonanza.
0057.00006; We are now quite used to the insatiable avarice at the top of corporations, and shareholders tend to go along with it.
0057.00007; But for 49.5 per cent of Ryanair's shareholders, O'Leary's avidity was just too much  -  they voted against the package. It is a pity they lost the vote, but the revolt may, nonetheless, be a watershed. It suggests that perhaps there is a dawning awareness that the era of out-of-control rapacity must end.
0057.00008; For, leaving aside its enormously destructive consequences for democracy, it makes no sense even on its own terms. O'Leary's deal illustrates the folly and unsustainability of the idea that has driven corporate pay packages ever further beyond the bounds of decency or rationality: a warped notion of incentive.
0057.00009; This is one of the big problems with this 'incentive' culture  -  the fabulous rewards for success are almost never matched by real penalties for failure  Firstly, what is O'Leary being incentivised to do?
0057.00010; To undo his own failures.
0057.00011; If you just take the proposition behind his package on face value, it looks plausible. To get his jackpot, O'Leary has to double Ryanair's share price to €21 and keep it there for 28 consecutive days at any time between April 2021 and March 2024. Michael O'Leary is being rewarded for failure.
0057.00012; He's the boss who oversaw the fall in the share price from €18.60 to where it is now  -  just under €10.
0057.00013; File photograph: Laurie Dieffembacq/AFP/Getty Images  Wouldn't that be an amazing achievement worthy of spectacular rewards? Actually, no. Ryanair's share price in 2017 was €18.60.
0057.00014; So O'Leary's goal is to reach in 2024 a share price that is 12 per cent up on what it was seven years earlier.
0057.00015; That doesn't sound quite so magical, does it? And in fact, he's being rewarded for failure.
0057.00016; He's the boss who oversaw the fall in the share price from €18.60 to where it is now  -  just under €10.
0057.00017; He bears responsibility, surely, for the decisions that led to that fall: the very poor industrial relations that have led to strikes by pilots, the screwing up of rosters that led to the mass cancellation of flights, the very heavy bet on Boeing's ill-fated 737 Max. But because of those failings, he now gets to buy Ryanair shares for €7 per share less than they were would have cost him in 2017.  This is one of the big problems with this incentive culture  -  the fabulous rewards for success are almost never matched by real penalties for failure.
0057.00018; (O'Leary's pay cut is, in the context of his potential gains, merely for the optics.)
0057.00019; Secondly, O'Leary's pot of gold tells us something about the whole nature of incentives at this level: the outrageous extravagance is both inbuilt and ever-increasing.
0057.00020; But if, like O'Leary, I already have €400 million, I have more money than I can ever spend.
0057.00021; No amount of money you offer me is going to make any real difference to me  Never mind the law of diminishing returns, there is here a law of rising returns.
0057.00022; At these stratospheric levels of reward, the whole idea of incentive breaks down. If I'm living hand-to-mouth on €20,000 a year and you offer me the possibility to make that €25,000 a year, I have a huge incentive to grasp it because it will markedly improve my life.
0057.00023; The measure of success that Ryanair and Michael O'Leary have reinforced ('shareholder value') is increasingly understood even within corporate capitalism as poisonous.
0057.00024; File photograph: Gleb Garanich/Reuters  But if, like O'Leary, I already have €400 million, I have more money than I can ever spend. No amount of money you offer me is going to make any real difference to me.
0057.00025; The paradox, however, is that the less difference the money really makes to me, the more you have to offer me.
0057.00026; The money has become purely symbolic of my very special status, so it better be bloody enormous. It is not an incentive to achieve but a tribute to my existing magnificence  -  so anything less than an obscene sum would be an insult.
0057.00027; Thirdly, a package like O'Leary's pins the worth of a company to the wrong values.
0057.00028; It encourages short-term thinking: the goals must be reached by 2024. And the goals themselves are brutally narrow: the share price is all that matters. There are many possible measures of success  -  the satisfaction of customers, the wellbeing and prosperity of employees, the reduction in carbon emissions, the company's contribution to society.
0057.00029; The one that Ryanair and O'Leary have reinforced (shareholder value) is increasingly understood even within corporate capitalism as poisonous. As that bastion of American corporatism, Forbes magazine, put it last week maximising shareholder value has come to be seen as leading to a toxic mix of soaring short-term corporate profits, astronomic executive pay, along with stagnant median incomes, growing inequality, periodic massive financial crashes, declining corporate life expectancy, slowing productivity, declining rates of return on assets and, overall, a widening distrust in business.
0057.00030; O'Leary's golden ticket is for a pointless flight to a bleak destination.
0057.00031; Even Ryanair's own smarter shareholders no longer want to take that ride. Topics:

0059.00001; Ontario Proud director Ryan O'Connor, left, walks with founder Jeff Ballingall in Toronto.
0059.00002; Mr. Ballingall's company churned out anti-Liberal memes ahead of 2018's provincial election, targeting leader Kathleen Wynne as a 'clown,' 'scumbag' and 'corrupt.'
0059.00003; Mark Blinch/The Globe and Mail  By the summer of 2017, Jeff Ballingall had hit the internet marketing sweet spot.
0059.00004; His creation, a Facebook page called Ontario Proud, had built a loyal following of tens of thousands of users by tapping into two seemingly unrelated emotions: a fondness for sentimental images of Ontario landmarks, and rising anger with the provincial Liberal government, led by then-premier Kathleen Wynne.
0059.00005; What started as a lark in 2016 had turned into serious digital sway: an anti-Liberal meme machine that regularly pilloried Ms. Wynne and her cabinet for rising hydro rates and the province's debt.
0059.00006; One year after launching his project, Mr. Ballingall incorporated Ontario Proud.
0059.00007; He had become an official political influencer and the next stop on his journey was to get paid.
0059.00008; Story continues below advertisement  It started with small donations from like-minded Facebook followers, but by Aug. 2, 2017, he had attracted some real money.
0059.00009; On that day, Mr. Ballingall sent an e-mail to Robert Faissal, a Toronto-based entrepreneur and a much sought-after Progressive Conservative donor. I understand you're expecting to hear from me, Mr. Ballingall wrote. The two met in a parkette at Toronto's luxury Four Seasons hotel, which led to Mr. Faissal cutting Ontario Proud a $10,000 cheque.
0059.00010; As for how Mr. Ballingall knew that Mr. Faissal was expecting him to reach out, Mr. Ballingall says he can't recall.
0059.00011; For his part, Mr. Faissal says he is certain who connected them: Alykhan Velshi, a well-known conservative political operative who was, at the time, chief of staff to the then-leader of Ontario's Progressive Conservatives, Patrick Brown.
0059.00012; Robert Faissal, shown in 2011.
0059.00013; Della Rollins/The Globe and Mail  Election regulators have tried to discourage groups such as Ontario Proud from functioning as an end run for political parties skirting the caps on how much money they can accept  -  and Mr. Faissal says he was vaguely aware of these issues when he says he received a phone call from Mr. Velshi about Mr. Ballingall's project.
0059.00014; I told Alykhan 'as long as it's legal,'  Mr. Faissal said.
0059.00015; He's like, 'yep, it's absolutely legal.'
0059.00016; (When asked about Mr. Faissal's account, Mr. Velshi called it totally untrue, but also acknowledged having met Mr. Faissal and telling anyone who would listen that Ontario Proud was the best thing to happen to the Tories.) Whatever role Mr. Velshi played in the donation, if any, the suggestion that it was legal is correct  -  and that's because his payment was made in a regulatory vacuum, one that all advocacy groups like Ontario Proud have used to their advantage in the months leading up to the federal election campaign announced this week.
0059.00017; When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asked the Governor-General to dissolve Parliament on Wednesday, kick-starting Canada's 43rd general election campaign, the political parties officially began their push to secure the most seats in the House of Commons. But for other kinds of parties  -  known officially in law as third-party political advertisers  -  the campaign merely marks the continuation of a persuasion war they have been waging for months and months.
0059.00018; Story continues below advertisement  Over the past few years, there has been a proliferation of special purpose groups, all created to denigrate either Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer or Mr. Trudeau, the heads of the two parties favoured to win the race. Some groups, such as the anti-Scheer Engage Canada, which is primarily funded by labour unions, rely on traditional media, such as television advertising. Others, such as Ontario Proud  -  which has inspired a national version, Canada Proud, and sister Proud organizations in almost every province  -  depend more on organic, digital messaging.
0059.00019; Ontario Proud and its affiliates have set their sights squarely on the federal campaign and Mr. Trudeau, using a combination of brash messaging, embarrassing photographs and pithy one-liners − Trudeau is bananas  -  to raise doubts about the Liberal Leader.
0059.00020; Regardless of form, these groups all have one thing in common: When they started fundraising and designing their attacks in 2017, 2018 and the beginning of this year, they did so under a cover of secrecy that Canada's election law, as well as some provincial rules, affords them.
0059.00021; Canada's campaign-finance rules, as well as Ontario's, prohibit third-party groups from colluding with candidates and political parties to circumvent donation limits.
0059.00022; But those laws only apply to a specified period of time  -  federally, it's about two and a half months − before an election campaign is announced.
0059.00023; Which means that, for the many months and years leading up to that point, such groups are effectively unregulated and free to raise as much money as they want, however they want.
0059.00024; It's one of the many troublesome holes in the rules that was highlighted by Greg Essensa, Ontario's Chief Electoral Officer, three years ago when he warned legislators about a rising wave of third-party influence.
0059.00025; In contrast to parties and candidates, which are subject to limits, third-party advertisers have the power to raise an unlimited amount of money, Mr. Essensa told the provincial standing committee on general government in 2016.
0059.00026; Ontario Chief Electoral Officer Greg Essensa, shown in 2012.
0059.00027; Moczulski/The Globe and Mail  Canadians, in general, regard their political battles as much more genteel than those fought in the United States, where super PACs − political action committees that advocate on behalf of certain individuals, parties or policies  -  raise and spend vast amounts of unregulated money to destroy the reputations of candidates they oppose.
0059.00028; But Mr. Essensa warned Ontario legislators that, left unchecked, the province could go down a similar road.
0059.00029; Among Mr. Essensa's long list of concerns is how the law largely allows third-party advertisers to hide the identities of their funders  -  so long as they accept those funds outside the statutory reporting period, which for Ontario is six months before the writs are issued.
0059.00030; Mr. Faissal's donation is a case in point: He cut his cheque about 10 months before the provincial election, which means Ontario Proud had no obligation to disclose it to the regulator.
0059.00031; Had Mr. Faissal not acknowledged to The Globe and Mail that he offered up this money, no one but Ontario Proud would know he was a major donor.
0059.00032; During the six-month period when Ontario Proud was required to disclose the contributions it received, it recorded about $489,000 in donations, the majority of which came from home builders and construction companies, corporations that are barred from donating to political parties.
0059.00033; As for how much Ontario Proud raised during the previous 20 months of its existence  -  and who contributed the funds  -  that remains a mystery.
0059.00034; Mr. Essensa called on legislators to force disclosure of all donors regardless of timing.
0059.00035; For its part, Ontario Proud says it is not beholden to any particular political party and has gone so far as to issue libel notices to social-media commentators who suggest otherwise.
0059.00036; Whenever there's a regulated period, we comply with the letter and the spirit of the law, Ryan O'Connor, a director of Ontario Proud and its lawyer, said in an interview with The Globe.
0059.00037; Story continues below advertisement  Mr. O'Connor, seen at right with Mr. Ballingall, says Ontario Proud's activities 'comply with the letter and the spirit of the law.' Mark Blinch/The Globe and Mail  A review of Ontario Proud's history paints a web of links to the Tories. A significant amount of the cash it raised in 2018 was collected by professional fundraisers who, months before, courted donors for the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party.
0059.00038; Mr. Ballingall, too, is deeply enmeshed in conservative circles, both personally and financially: He worked in Ottawa for a former Conservative defence minister his private company, Mobilize Media, was contracted in 2017 to help two federal Conservative leadership campaigns and the Ontario PC Party paid Mobilize $67,800 for social-media services around that time as well.
0059.00039; These same issues of overlap between political advertisers and political parties swirl around union-backed, anti-Conservative groups as well.
0059.00040; One of them, Engage Canada  -  which was founded by prominent former Liberal and New Democratic strategists  -  blanketed the airwaves with ads in the spring during the NBA playoffs  -  all of them broadcast, incidentally, before the federal disclosure period kicked in on June 30, allowing its funders and the exact cost of the ads to remain a secret. (Industry experts estimated that Engage's prime time television ads, which portrayed Mr. Scheer as a pliable, bobblehead doll, would have cost between $45,000 and $75,000.)
0059.00041; As of the publication of this story, Engage Canada had still not registered as a third-party advertiser with Elections Canada.
0059.00042; And it's not just regulators who are concerned.
0059.00043; Even one of the third-party advertisers agreed that this regulatory black hole is a problem. Taylor Scollon, the co-founder of the progressive third-party political advertiser North99 pointed out that Canadian elections have disclosure rules, and limits, in order to restrict the amount of influence powerful and well-resourced organizations can have on public opinion.
0059.00044; But those rules do not reflect the reality of campaigns that last 365 days a year, he said. If the campaign is every day  -  if we now have permanent campaigns  -  then we should apply the same reasoning and require disclosure during non-election periods, Mr. Scollon said.
0059.00045; Story continues below advertisement  Back in 2016, however, when Mr. Essensa gave his public warning to Ontario lawmakers about what he saw on the horizon, Ontario Proud and North99 were not on anyone's radar. Although Mr. Essensa did not single out a specific third party, he was likely referring to the group that paved the way for such players  -  an advocacy group that the Tories have long said unfairly targeted their leaders until they were compelled to fight back: The Working Families Coalition. Kingston, 1999: Police try to keep protesters away from Ontario Progressive Conservative leader Mike Harris's campaign bus, which had been leaving a breakfast meeting.
0059.00046; Labour movement opposition to Mr. Harris's government helped create Canadian equivalents to the political action committees active in the United States.
0059.00047; Jack Chiang/Kingston Whig-Standard/The Canadian Press  The birth of the Canadian-style political action committee was on the left of the political spectrum.
0059.00048; It was 1998, and Mike Harris, Ontario's Progressive Conservative premier at the time, had effectively used wedge politics to create enemies of organized labour groups who he said were bankrupting the province at the expense of hard-working Ontario taxpayers. The Harris government had repealed labour laws, making it more difficult for trade unions to become certified. So when the union leaders who represent electricians, pipefitters and iron workers and others arrived in Kingston for the annual meeting of the Building Trades Council  -  an umbrella organization of trade unions − they vowed to turn the tables.
0059.00049; They passed a resolution to push back with their own form of messaging, one that would inform the public about what they say was the damage wrought, not by them, but by the Harris government.
0059.00050; At first they called it the Building Ontario Campaign, and it launched in time for the 1999 Ontario election.
0059.00051; But they barely made a dent, and the Harris government was re-elected with a slightly smaller majority government. The council, however, saw room for improvement and impact − if only they could make their ads more effective. The big mistake that we made was that we did not hire professionals, pollsters and communications strategists and so on, said Patrick Dillon, the Building Trades president at the time and one of the founders of Working Families.
0059.00052; Story continues below advertisement  They interviewed political operatives across the political spectrum and settled on two with close ties to the Liberals, Mr. Dillon said. Don Guy  -  who would go on to run the Ontario Liberal Party's coming 2003 campaign  -  would conduct the group's opinion polls through his company Pollara Marcel Wieder  -  a well-known political consultant once profiled in this newspaper under the headline The Dirty-Tricks Man  -  was the strategist. Other labour groups alienated by the Harris government, such as teachers and nurses, jumped on board.
0059.00053; Thus was born the Working Families Coalition, an innocuous-sounding title designed to mask what its detractors argue is a dark mission  -  scuffing up the images of Progressive Conservative leaders.
0059.00054; That campaign made its debt on April 1, 2003, about six months before the next provincial election, and targeted Mr. Harris's successor, then-premier Ernie Eves.
0059.00055; Working Families produced a full-page newspaper ad, published in The Globe, prominently displaying a photograph of a smirking Mr. Eves in a tuxedo and bow tie, his hair slicked back.
0059.00056; The bold text below the photo read: Ernie Thinks He Can Fool You, a play on the date April 1.
0059.00057; The ad got a lot of attention, but Working Families was only getting started.
0059.00058; In 2003, Working Families bought a full-page ad in The Globe and Mail targeting Ontario premier Ernie Eves.
0059.00059; Over the next three provincial elections, the group would repeatedly dip into its deep war chest, buy airtime and ratchet up the caricaturing of conservative leaders as heartless Bay Street puppets. After electoral losses in 2003 and 2007, the Progressive Conservatives had had enough and the party formally asked Mr. Essensa to investigate what it alleged was co-ordination between Working Families and the Liberal Party.
0059.00060; One of the pieces of evidence they pointed to was the dual roles of Mr. Guy, who was the Liberal campaign director in 2003, 2007 and 2011, and whose firm, Pollara, was retained by Working Families.
0059.00061; Story continues below advertisement  The subsequent investigation, conducted with assistance from Bay Street firm Torys LLP, found that although Mr. Guy's ties to the party and Working Families was grounds for concern, there was insufficient evidence that the Liberal Party was controlling the coalition, and therefore, there was no violation of the anti-collusion provisions.
0059.00062; Although that finding was Mr. Essensa's to wear, he did not appear happy about it.
0059.00063; His testimony in 2016 to the standing committee made it clear that he was frustrated with the outcome, and although he didn't identify Working Families by name, he said the legal bar for proving collusion was too high.
0059.00064; I will leave it to the lawyers to tell you how hard it is to prove there is direct evidence of this sort of control, he said before legislators.
0059.00065; But he said those who raise concerns about strategists playing for two teams  -  a political party and a third-party advertiser  -  have a point.
0059.00066; Such close affiliation undermines confidence in the electoral process.
0059.00067; The public can plainly see that candidates and organizations that claim to be non-partisan are able to actively co-ordinate their advertising. As a last gasp, the Progressive Conservatives tried to get the courts to intervene and overturn Mr. Essensa's ruling, but the case was dismissed at Divisional Court and the Ontario Court of Appeal. Working Families ran more ads during the 2014 campaign, which the PCs lost again, and there was no reason to believe anything would change.
0059.00068; But in a high-rise office building in downtown Toronto, there was a restless conservative operative, working for one of the country's premier public affairs and crisis communications companies.
0059.00069; Jeff Ballingall had followed the well-worn path of a young conservative ideologue: as a teenager, he volunteered for the local Canadian Alliance candidate in his hometown of Sarnia, Ont., a working-class city of about 70,000 in the southwestern part of the province.
0059.00070; After graduating from the University of Western Ontario, he worked as a political staffer, first for Conservative defence minister Gordon O'Connor in Ottawa and, later, a right-leaning Toronto city councillor.
0059.00071; He had a brief stint at the short-lived Sun News television network before finally landing where so many young, ambitious conservative strategists before him had found a home: Navigator Ltd., the public-relations company founded by well-known Tory spin master Jaime Watt.
0059.00072; But it was at Navigator where Mr. Ballingall decided to shake things up.
0059.00073; For years, he had been brainstorming about how a conservative third-party advertiser in Canada might work. When a friend had some success with an Alberta-centric Facebook page, Mr. Ballingall sought and obtained his blessing in early 2016 to launch an Ontario equivalent  -  calling it Ontario Proud.
0059.00074; As he fiddled with the page, he applied another lesson he learned at Navigator: Whenever Navigator was trying to disseminate a message on behalf of one of its corporate clients, those messages didn't stick  -  especially when the message was coming directly from the corporation. Audiences were skeptical of a corporation advocating for itself.
0059.00075; But if you can talk about it in a different way, and from a different messenger, they're more receptive, he said.
0059.00076; In August, 2016, he left Navigator and devoted himself full-time to his creation.
0059.00077; Story continues below advertisement  An Ontario Proud post from April 6, 2016, targets Ms. Wynne over funding to autistic children.
0059.00078; Facebook/Ontario Proud  At some point in 2016, then-Ontario premier Kathleen Wynne was being driven to an event when she pulled out her tablet to take the pulse of social media.
0059.00079; That's when, she says, she discovered a Facebook page that seemed to have some traction.
0059.00080; It seemed like this bright, cheery thing, she said in an interview.
0059.00081; Ontario Proud? I'm a proud Ontarian.
0059.00082; What is this?
0059.00083; This was going to make her re-election prospects even worse. Ontario Proud had hit a mark that everyone in the eyeball-attraction business is striving for: engagement. Mr. Ballingall's posts about Ontario roadside attractions and some of its famous citizens  -  Shania Twain, John Candy, the Friendly Giant − struck a chord.
0059.00084; But most important, they were shared widely, which allowed Mr. Ballingall to collect all sorts of data about his followers and their interests.
0059.00085; One of the first Ontario Proud posts to go viral was a photo of Webers, the burger joint north of Toronto in cottage country where diners eat in refurbished train cars.
0059.00086; Like many of Mr. Ballingall's posts, the Webers meme urged readers to spread the nostalgia: Share if you know where this magical burger place is.
0059.00087; Eighty thousand people reposted the photo on their Facebook page, thereby introducing their friends to Ontario Proud. But there was a whole other side to Ontario Proud. Ontario Proud took a hard line on certain ideological issues, such as military intervention (share if you believe Canada should still bomb ISIS) and immigration policy (criminals and terrorists will prey on our generosity).
0059.00088; But its hardest line was reserved for Ms. Wynne.
0059.00089; It referred to Ms. Wynne as a clown, a scumbag and corrupt.
0059.00090; Just like Working Families spoofed Ernie Eves on April 1, Ontario Proud used the date to target Ms. Wynne and her minister of energy at the time, Glenn Thibeault, but with the insult dial cranked up a notch. A photo of the two Liberals was captioned: Happy April  -  here are some fools.
0059.00091; On one occasion, which Mr. Ballingall says he now regrets, Ontario Proud went after Ms. Wynne's appearance, comparing her spectacled look to that of the late Orville Redenbacher, the iconic popcorn maker: What's the worst part of grocery shopping in Ontario?
0059.00092; Seeing the premier's face in the snack aisle. An April Fool's Day post targets Ms. Wynne and Glenn Thibeault, then the energy minister.
0059.00093; Mr. Ballingall says he now regrets another ad comparing the premier to popcorn pitchman Orville Redenbacher.
0059.00094; Facebook/Ontario Proud  In an interview earlier this year with Ms. Wynne at her office in the Ontario Legislature, where she now sits as a Liberal MPP after her government was handily defeated in the 2018 provincial election, she says she's not willing to give too much credit to Mr. Ballingall for her downfall.
0059.00095; Her party had governed for 15 years and voters were clearly ready for a change.
0059.00096; But where she will acknowledge Ontario Proud's impact was on how voters perceived her. I don't think I realized that this guy was going to be as potent as he was, she said.
0059.00097; Throughout the campaign, she said she heard a familiar refrain from her candidates when they described a day of door knocking: empathy for the local candidate, but an unspecified dislike of Ms. Wynne.
0059.00098; When the Liberals attempted to drill down on what it was about Ms. Wynne that turned them off, the answers were vague, she said.
0059.00099; I think it was that Ontario Proud, and whatever other forces were out there, were successful at making me the lightning rod for whatever anger [voters] had, she said.
0059.00100; That opinion is, perhaps, one of the only things that Mr. Ballingall and the former Liberal leader agree upon.
0059.00101; At a speaking event in April, convened by Toronto's Empire Club, Mr. Ballingall boasted about how Ontario Proud made Ms. Wynne socially unacceptable to voters. And if people are offended by his language and name-calling, he said in an interview, they can point their finger in the direction of Working Families, one of the many motivators for creating his own right-wing, third-party advertiser. Story continues below advertisement  Working Families is a common theme in any discussion with Mr. Ballingall about his brainchild.
0059.00102; Asked to defend some of the insults Ontario Proud has hurled at Ms. Wynne, he pivots to the attacks endured by Progressive Conservative leaders for more than a decade by Working Families.
0059.00103; He also revels in what he says is his underdog status  -  explaining that while Working Families can effortlessly turn to its deep pool of member-donated cash to fund its ads, he only relies on hustle, his knack for crafting concise, highly consumed content and his ability to persuade a disparate group of individuals and companies to support him financially.
0059.00104; But Mr. Ballingall is not quite as handicapped as he portrays himself. For one, he has had help from professional fundraisers who, up until 2017, worked directly for Ontario's Progressive Conservative Party.
0059.00105; That year, the same year that Ms. Wynne's government banned union and corporate donations to political parties, the Ontario PCs parted ways with two of the party's top in-house fundraisers: Mariana Di Rezze and Sharon Flashford, both of whom have cultivated relationships with some of Ontario's wealthiest citizens and amassed thick Rolodexes of potential donors. Both women went on to raise money for Ontario Proud under the banner of their new fundraising company, RevGen Professional Fundraisers. It was in 2018, around the same time Mr. Ballingall turned to RevGen, that he says Ontario Proud raised big money.
0059.00106; All in all, during the six-month period that Ontario Proud is required to disclose donors, it raised $489,000.
0059.00107; But this was not entirely the doing of RevGen, Mr. Ballingall says.
0059.00108; They helped, he said.
0059.00109; He also says he never co-ordinated with the fundraisers when they were directly employed by the PC fund and, what's more, he didn't even know them before they left the employment of the party.
0059.00110; But, in a statement, they said that their company does not share information between clients.
0059.00111; All clients' donor data is the exclusive property of the client and is not used for any other purpose.
0059.00112; Mr. Ballingall had other money-making tools at his disposal.
0059.00113; As a publisher of content that people like to read and share, Ontario Proud can also disseminate messages for businesses and industries  -  for a fee.
0059.00114; In the media business, such advertisements are known as sponsored content, and are usually labelled as such to ensure readers don't confuse an article that has been bought and paid for as a piece of journalism.
0059.00115; Ontario Proud has published sponsored content, none of it labelled. An excerpt from a 2018 Ontario Proud video criticizing the Wynne Liberals' plans for home-care services for seniors.
0059.00116; Facebook/Ontario Proud  For example, in May, 2018, Ontario Proud posted a video titled: Wynne's Attack Dogs Get Special Deals.
0059.00117; The minute-and-a-half-long clip, which has been viewed nearly 90,000 times, criticized a Liberal plan to create a government-led agency to deliver home care to seniors.
0059.00118; It was not unusual for Ontario Proud to attack a big, expensive government program, but the message was actually paid for by Grosso McCarthy, a public affairs and strategy company that specializes in health-care policy. Ontario Proud charged the company $7,000 and disclosed it in its filings to Elections Ontario.
0059.00119; In an interview, Francesca Grosso, one of the principals of Grosso McCarthy, said that her company did not consider the transaction to be a donation in the typical sense − rather, it was a payment for the creation of the video.
0059.00120; Mr. Ballingall told her the production of the video would cost about $6,000, and that Ontario Proud would charge an additional $1,000 to post the content and boost the ad through Facebook.
0059.00121; He was adamant that the amount would need to be disclosed given the way the rules were written, and I appreciated his interest in transparency, she said.
0059.00122; Story continues below advertisement  I thought this was a bargain, given that the cost of media buys and production costs are usually through the roof, she said.
0059.00123; As for who else has paid Mr. Ballingall to post tailored messages, he won't specify.
0059.00124; When asked about the number of pro-Canadian oil posts, he acknowledged that he has received support from the Canadian energy industry. Mr. Ballingall estimated that less than 1 per cent of Ontario Proud's posts are sponsored content, and he said that the group would never post material that was not in keeping with its core principles. Mr. Ballingall would not disclose how much his company, Mobilize Media, had made from Ontario Proud.
0059.00125; Mark Blinch/The Globe and Mail  Then there is the matter of how Mr. Ballingall, himself, gets paid.
0059.00126; On paper, Ontario Proud is a not-for-profit corporation. (When the group's lawyer, Mr. O'Connor, was called to testify before the House of Commons ethics committee, he described Ontario Proud in his prepared remarks as predominantly non-profit. Asked to clarify this in an interview, he said Ontario Proud is strictly non-profit and explained, I may have, frankly, misspoke.)
0059.00127; But just because Ontario Proud is prohibited from turning a profit doesn't mean its vendors are.
0059.00128; And one of Ontario Proud's frequently used vendors is Mobilize Media, Mr. Ballingall's company.
0059.00129; Mr. Ballingall will not disclose how much Mobilize has made from Ontario Proud and public records only offer a glimpse of what Mobilize charges.
0059.00130; When Ontario Proud was starting to peak in 2017, records show that the PC Party hired Mobilize for advertising/communications/media work.
0059.00131; Mr. Ballingall was also hired by both Tony Clement and Lisa Raitt during the federal leadership race at respective price tags of $3,500 and $28,406.05.
0059.00132; When asked whether he used Ontario Proud's wide audience to help those clients, Mr. Ballingall said that when he took those contracts, Ontario Proud was not yet registered with any regulators as a third-party advertiser.
0059.00133; Would we work on a campaign now?
0059.00134; No.
0059.00135; Mr. Ballingall has also leveraged his success into a job as the chief marketing officer of The Post Millennial, a digital news website with a distinct populist bent.
0059.00136; Ontario Proud regularly disseminates Post Millennial stories through its Facebook and Twitter pages.
0059.00137; Throughout their interview with The Globe, Mr. Ballingall and Mr. O'Connor repeatedly stressed that Ontario Proud prides itself on its independence  -  and that, far from merely echoing the talking points of the PCs or federal Conservatives, it is pushing the parties in certain directions, too. Recently, in a rare critique of the Ford government, Ontario Proud lived up to that assertion.
0059.00138; On Twitter, Ontario Proud retweeted a Globe editorial that criticized the Ford government's lottery system for granting licences to entrepreneurs interested in opening retail cannabis stores.
0059.00139; Another failure from the Ford government. Half-baked, timid policy doesn't serve their public or political interests, Ontario Proud wrote.
0059.00140; We wouldn't want to be directed by a political party, even if it was legal, Mr. O'Connor said.
0059.00141; We don't want to have that reputation.

0060.00002; Adam Neumann Steps Down Under Pressure Image  WeWork's co-founder Adam NeumannCreditCreditIllustration by Molly Bedford Photograph by Peter Prato for The New York Times  By David Gelles, Michael J. de la Merced, Peter Eavis and Andrew Ross Sorkin  Adam Neumann turned WeWork into one of the most valuable start-ups in the world largely through the force of his outsize personality.
0060.00003; He persuaded investors to give him billions of dollars and employees to believe that the shared-office company was changing the world.
0060.00004; That same mix of ambition and idealism forced Mr. Neumann to step down as chief executive after a lengthy board meeting on Tuesday.
0060.00005; He was under pressure from directors and investors after he led a botched attempt to take the closely watched company public.
0060.00006; The announcement marked a swift and stunning fall for Mr. Neumann, who had enormous control over WeWork and spoke about the company with missionary zeal  -  he has said the company aimed to elevate the world's consciousness.
0060.00007; WeWork expanded with breakneck speed in recent years, putting co-working locations in dozens of countries and becoming the largest commercial tenant in Manhattan. It attracted a private valuation of $47 billion as recently as January, with top Wall Street bankers telling Mr. Neumann that his company could be worth a lot more once its shares traded on the stock market.
0060.00008; Mr. Neumann, 40, was the company's charismatic frontman, a towering, hard-partying Israeli with long hair and a penchant for leather jackets and tequila.
0060.00009; He used the company to fund his pet projects, maintained a lavish lifestyle complete with private jets and luxury homes.
0060.00010; And Mr. Neumann was highly impulsive  -  he once banned meat at the company, forcing executives to quickly come up with a rationale for why.
0060.00011; When it came time to list WeWork on the stock market, this all proved too much for the institutional investors who make or break the fortunes of publicly traded companies.
0060.00012; After the company filed its offering documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission last month, investors began scrutinizing its business model and Mr. Neumann's behavior, and sentiment quickly turned against WeWork.
0060.00013; Last week, the company decided to delay its offering after bankers and investors signaled that the company might be worth just $15 billion.
0060.00014; Now, with his resignation as chief executive, Mr. Neumann joins an ignominious club that includes Travis Kalanick, who was ousted as the chief of Uber before he could take it public.
0060.00015; Spending too much too soon on unproven business models only heightens the risk that a company's race for global domination can become a race to oblivion, said Len Sherman, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School and an expert in entrepreneurship.
0060.00016; Mr. Neumann will be nonexecutive chairman of WeWork's parent, the We Company.
0060.00017; WeWork named two current executives, Sebastian Gunningham and Artie Minson, co-chief executives. The company will conduct a search for a new permanent chief executive, according to four people who asked for anonymity to discuss a delicate subject.
0060.00018; A WeWork spokeswoman, Gwen Rocco, said in an emailed statement, There is no search for another chief executive either underway or planned. Mr. Neumann, who controlled a majority of the shareholder votes, was ultimately the one who decided to step down. But he did so after he lost the support of some of his key backers, including SoftBank, the Japanese technology giant, which is WeWork's biggest outside investor.
0060.00019; On Sunday, Mr. Neumann met with the chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, and later in the day had dinner with Bruce Dunlevie, a partner at Benchmark Capital and a director of the We Company, to discuss his options.
0060.00020; Then on Tuesday, Mr. Neumann and his board met at the Midtown Manhattan offices of JPMorgan to nail down the management shake-up, according to two people familiar with the meeting.
0060.00021; In a statement, Mr. Neumann said the scrutiny of his personal life and management was hurting the company.
0060.00022; Since the announcement of our I.P.O., too much of the focus has been placed on me, he said in a note to employees that was reviewed by The New York Times.
0060.00023; The management shake-up is the most significant step the company has taken to win over Wall Street after the botched initial public offering and signals that power may be swinging away from the founders of fast-growing businesses toward investors. Other high-flying start-ups, including the ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft, have also struggled this year, and their share prices have fallen sharply after their stock market debuts.
0060.00024; Investors saw through Lyft, and they saw through Uber as well, said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank.
0060.00025; This one has simply been rejected.
0060.00026; Investors are saying, 'We're not going to tolerate this nonsense anymore.'
0060.00027; One of investors' biggest concerns has been that Mr. Neumann exercised too much control over the company through special voting shares. He will now lose much of his power over the company.
0060.00028; Each of his special shares will have three votes, down from 20 votes earlier this year, according to two people briefed on the change, who were not authorized to disclose it.
0060.00029; Mr. Neumann will not be able to control more than a minority of the board's directors, and he won't have control over any of the board's committees, according to one of those people.
0060.00030; Analysts also criticized deals in which Mr. Neumann took stakes in buildings and leased them to WeWork, an arrangement that might have allowed him to personally profit at the company's expense.
0060.00031; A WeWork entity later took over the management of the properties, a move designed to eliminate conflicts of interest.
0060.00032; He also returned a $5.9 million payment the company made to him for use of the trademarked word We.
0060.00033; The fundamental question here is: Does it help to be a really strong and at times abrasive personality to be innovative? said Walter Isaacson, a professor of history at Tulane University who knows Mr. Neumann.
0060.00034; The answer is it doesn't always help, and at times it goes too far. Still, Mr. Neumann's departure as chief executive might not be enough to bolster interest in WeWork's shares.
0060.00035; Investors have also expressed concerns that the company is spending too much money and is unlikely to turn a profit in the foreseeable future.
0060.00036; WeWork is now considering slowing down that growth sharply. It could lay off as many as 5,000 employees, according to one person briefed on the matter.
0060.00037; We employed more than 12,500 employees as of June 30, according to its regulatory filings.
0060.00038; The company's losses have ballooned as it has spent huge sums taking on new leases and refurbishing its locations. In the first half of the year, its operating losses totaled $1.37 billion, about twice as much as it lost in the same period last year.
0060.00039; The company used up nearly $1.5 billion to run its business and expand in the first half of the year and had just under $2.5 billion in cash at the end of June.
0060.00040; WeWork had hoped to raise up to $4 billion from the public offering and up to $6 billion more in bank loans that were contingent on the I.P.O.
0060.00041; The new chief executives will now have to perform a delicate dance with investors.
0060.00042; They probably need to slow We's expansion to allay fears about its finances, but not so much that the company loses its allure as a turbocharged business. Our core business is strong, and we will be taking clear actions to balance WeWork's high growth, profitability and unique member experience while also evaluating the optimal timing for an I.P.O., Mr. Minson and Mr. Gunningham said in a statement.
0060.00043; Despite the company's problems, analysts say, Mr. Neumann and WeWork have been the driving force in the flexible-office-space business, which is transforming commercial real estate. Professionals, start-ups and big corporations alike are flocking to locations run by WeWork and others, attracted by shorter leases and nicely designed spaces.
0060.00044; But it might take a more seasoned chief executive who has run businesses with a steady hand to convince investors that WeWork can become a sustainable business, not just a fast-growing one.
0060.00045; Other so-called unicorn companies  -  businesses backed by venture capital firms that are worth more than $1 billion  -  have had to make similar transitions. In 2017, under pressure from investors, Mr. Kalanick resigned as chief executive of Uber.
0060.00046; He was replaced by Dara Khosrowshahi, a former chief executive at Expedia, who set about trying to improve the culture at Uber and preparing the company for an I.P.O.
0060.00047; Uber and WeWork have something else in common: Their growth was fueled in part by money from SoftBank. The Japanese company has plowed billions of dollars into WeWork and other start-ups.
0060.00048; Softbank's chief executive, Masayoshi Son, has given founders of those businesses wide leeway and has looked the other way at excesses until investors in the public markets push back.

0064.00001; Brief  Elizabeth Regan  By  Leia Larsen  Sept. 23, 2019  Waste Management's Liberty Landfill in White County, Indiana cleared another rezoning hurdle as it seeks to expand by an estimated 114 acres. The current landfill footprint covers 169 acres and has nine years before it reaches capacity, according to public affairs manager Lisa Disbrow. The expansion could add an additional 18 years of disposal capacity.
0064.00002; Waste Management owns 565 acres at the site, including a buffer zone.
0064.00003; The company needs to earn the approval of the White County Board of Zoning Appeals for a special use exception.
0064.00004; From there, the expansion will need a green light from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
0064.00005; As recognized by Waste Management and other large landfill operators, expansion approvals have gotten more complex in recent years and that sometimes includes more complex host community agreements.
0064.00006; White County's Area Plan Commission previously approved the landfill's rezoning request in March with a 7-1 vote, according to meeting minutes. The hearing, however, drew a very large crowd of residents who expressed concerns.
0064.00007; Conditions listed in the county's amended host agreement include traffic control, litter control, tarp inspections, well testing, road maintenance, a recycling trailer, environmental education and a property value guarantee.
0064.00008; The property provision will require Waste Management to reimburse homeowners for fair market value if they can't find a buyer during the first 10 years after the landfill receives its expansion permit.
0064.00009; In return, homeowners must cooperate with the landfill's expansion plans and related improvements. The well testing condition applies to homeowners near the landfill as well.
0064.00010; The company will test wells annually, and if the tests reveal contamination caused by the facility, Waste Management will cover the cost of providing safe water.
0064.00011; Waste Management will also work with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reroute the adjacent Opal Carmichael Ditch to prevent pollution to the Tippecanoe River. Request for comment from the White County commissioners was not returned.
0064.00012; The landfill funnels $5 million in tipping fees to the county each year, and $1 million per year to Liberty and Cass townships. The Board of Zoning Appeals will likely weigh in on the special use exception later this year, Disbrow said.
0064.00013; The board's executive director, Joe Rogers, told Waste Dive he has yet to receive Waste Management's application.
0064.00014; Liberty Landfill opened in the early 1980s and accepts MSW and industrial waste. The facility also operates gas-to-energy plants that provide energy in partnership with Wabash Valley Power and the local rural electric cooperative. According to 2014 IDEM data, Liberty ranks among the state's top 10 landfills in terms of remaining potential disposal capacity.

0065.00001; Impaired visionWeWork sparks worries about Masayoshi Son's Vision Funds Private valuations of tech unicorns may have got out of step with public-market appetite  print-edition icon Print edition | Business twitter icon  facebook icon  linkedin icon  mail icon  print icon  WEWORK'S BUILDING in Tokyo's Shibuya district is a cross between an iceberg and a plastic bottle passed through a shredder.
0065.00002; Fitting, then, that the office-rental firm's abortive listing, shelved on September 17th, threatens a financial shredding for its mastermind, Masayoshi Son - and that the debacle may be the tip of an iceberg for his $100bn Vision Fund (VF).  Mr Son bet on Adam Neumann, WeWork's charismatic co-founder, after meeting him for half an hour in 2017. SoftBank, the Japanese group Mr Son controls, and the VF then gave the firm $4.4bn, despite its tenuous claim to techiness.
0065.00003; Mr Son would reportedly have handed over another $16bn this year had Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund, the VF's biggest backer, not objected.
0065.00004; But SoftBank gave WeWork $2bn anyway.
0065.00005; All told, the VF and SoftBank have invested or committed to invest $10.65bn in the firm and own 29% of it. Get our daily newsletter  Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.
0065.00006; Had WeWork gone public at $20bn (less than half the valuation of $47bn in its latest funding round), the VF and SoftBank could under one scenario have faced unrealised losses of up to $7.5bn, estimates Atul Goyal of Jefferies, an investment bank.
0065.00007; As sentiment soured, partly owing to WeWork's weak corporate governance, reports surfaced of Mr Neumann contemplating a value as low as $10bn.
0065.00008; WeWork will again attempt to list later this year - presumably with a better story about governance and path to profit.
0065.00009; Still, an initial public offering (IPO) may prove hard.
0065.00010; Investors may be disinclined to embrace a stock with a good chance of losing value quickly. If WeWork cannot raise new capital, Mr Son may have to come up with cash to keep it going. SoftBank's own share price has fallen by 20% since July.
0065.00011; Even with the IPO on ice, and no price set, the VF and SoftBank may still need to adjust WeWork's fair value.
0065.00012; That means the VF's stated returns may still have to be lowered when market prices are eventually taken into account.
0065.00013; In June it reported $20.2bn of gains on total investments of $71.4bn.
0065.00014; Some were realised many were paper gains on hard-to-value investments.
0065.00015; The deeper worry is that unicorn valuations in the private market may have risen materially above what public-market investors will pay in an IPO, says Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research.
0065.00016; Many of the VF's 83 investments could suffer unrealised losses if and when they go public.
0065.00017; True, it could enjoy post-IPO share-price rises.
0065.00018; Shares in Guardant Health, a VF-backed diagnostics firm, have more than tripled in price since its IPO in 2018. But Uber's shareholders have seen 30% of its value wiped out since it listed in May.
0065.00019; The VF is looking at more unrealised losses, of $3.9bn, on the ride-hailing firm, Jefferies reckons.
0065.00020; The WeWork fiasco comes as Mr Son's $108bn Vision Fund 2 was about to start. In August he said he would begin spending its cash within a month or two.
0065.00021; Memorandums of understanding have been inked with investors.
0065.00022; Worries about tech IPOs and an economic slump may make it harder to close.
0065.00023; The Saudi fund and Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment, another big investor in the original VF, are reportedly considering whether to scale back their investment in the new one.
0065.00024; An executive at one big sovereign-wealth fund says SoftBank may need a face-saving way to reduce the new VF's size.
0065.00025; Markets are too toppish to try and deploy another fund of that scale. The VF says WeWork, one of many firms in the portfolio, gets too much attention.
0065.00026; And Mr Son, who lost most of his wealth in the first dotcom bubble, is no stranger to the ups and downs of venture investing.
0065.00027; WeWork's Mr Neumann has admitted to feeling humbled by the delayed IPO.
0065.00028; His cheerleader-in-chief is probably not. ■  This article appeared in the Business section of the print edition under the headline Impaired vision  print-edition icon Print edition | Business twitter icon  facebook icon  linkedin icon  mail icon  print icon  Reuse this content  About The Economist

0068.00001; By JAMES REV SHARK DEPORRE  Stocks quotes in this article: TLT, SDC  The indices have some minor gains with breadth running about 4,550 gainers to 2,500 decliners.
0068.00002; There are more than 230 stocks hitting new 12-month highs, which is mainly due to continued strength in select small-caps.
0068.00003; What is most notable about the action Friday is the continued weakness in bonds. The iShares Barclays 20+ Bond Fund (TLT) broke below its 50-day simple moving average after a parabolic run in August.
0068.00004; A number of traders characterize the action as the bond bubble has popped.
0068.00005; There doesn't seem to be any particularly fundamental reason for bonds to weaken to such a degree.
0068.00006; There haven't been any major changes in the economic outlook and there are no indications of a major rotation out of bonds and into equities.
0068.00007; Expectations for the Fed have shifted slightly with a slight decline in expectations for a quarter-point cut, but it is still a near certainty.
0068.00008; Like the sector rotation that took place in equities earlier this week the move in bonds looks technically driven by big funds and isn't a function of a major shift in the economic outlook.
0068.00009; I am finding it extremely difficult to do much trading.
0068.00010; I'm concerned I'm trying too hard to force things in a think and choppy environment and it is probably better if I just relax and wait for something to develop. It is very likely we should see some increased movement into the Fed decision next week.
0068.00011; SmileDirectClub (SDC) disappointed Thursday when it failed to hold its IPO pricing but bored traders are having a good time playing a bounce in the name Friday. Nothing changed overnight but in the current environment it is a readily apparent trade and once it started to work others jump in as well.
0068.00012; I'll continue to look for some setups, however, it is probably better just to relax and wait until next week before making new moves.

0069.00001; in Investing  by James  ShareTweet  Americans are working hard, but employers aren't necessarily working for them.
0069.00002; Now a radical idea to guarantee U.S. workers a cut of their company's profits could one day force employers to cough up more of the wealth.
0069.00003; While established profit-sharing and equity-ownership programs already give a financial boost to many American workers, and enjoy bipartisan support in Washington, some advocates for workers' rights believe more must be done.
0069.00004; They want lawmakers to order U.S. companies to pay workers a cash dividend tied to profits, just like any shareholder receives.
0069.00005; Call it profit sharing 2.0. Its supporters envision a day when large privately owned and publicly traded U.S. companies would be required by law to transfer newly issued shares into a collective fund for their workers.
0069.00006; Employees wouldn't individually own the shares, which would wield voting power and be held in a worker-controlled trust, but would receive regular dividends.
0069.00007; The fund would be optional for small companies.
0069.00008; Granting employees an equity 'stake and a say' in the companies that they work for means that when corporate executives decide on the level of dividends to be paid to shareholders, the workers who created the profits will not be left in the dust, Lenore Palladino, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute and assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, wrote in an article published on the institute's website.
0069.00009; This dream of a fund that gives money and power to American workers is imported directly from the U.K., where it's gained considerable traction. In a July 2018 report commissioned by the U.K.'s progressive Co-Operative Party, the New Economics Foundation, a left-leaning London-based think tank, planted the seed for an inclusive ownership fund  -  a new way to transfer control of a business to workers over time.
0069.00010; 'Give more people a stake' If we want to build more inclusive, prosperous and productive companies, we need to broaden ownership and give more people a stake, Mathew Lawrence, director of London-based think tank Common Wealth and a co-author of the report, said in an email.
0069.00011; For precedent, the report's authors looked to the John Lewis Partnership, the U.K.'s largest worker-run company, whose generous and lucrative benefits make it something of a gold standard of employee profit-sharing.
0069.00012; In many respects, our proposal for an Inclusive Ownership Fund can be thought of as a John Lewis law, the report's authors noted.
0069.00013; The U.K.'s minority Labour Party soon took up the charge.
0069.00014; In September 2018 it endorsed a policy requiring U.K. firms with more than 250 employees to transfer 1% of company stock into an inclusive ownership fund for workers every year for 10 years, giving the fund 10% control of the company after a decade.
0069.00015; Dividends from company profits would be capped at 500 British pounds annually (currently just over $600), with the British government collecting any surplus to help pay for social services. If an employee leaves a company, he or she forfeits their interest in the fund. Inclusive ownership funds presumably would be enacted under a Labour-led government.
0069.00016; It's stirred heated debate in Britain, and surely would seem to be a polarizing topic for Americans. But even many progressive policy experts concede that forcing companies to establish inclusive ownership funds won't fly with most U.S. politicians or business leaders.
0069.00017; Maybe so, but it's understandably popular with U.S. workers: 55% of Americans support inclusive ownership funds, while just 20% are opposed, according to a March 2019 poll by Democracy Collaborative, a Washington, D.C.-based progressive research group, and YouGov, a U.K.-based market-research firm.
0069.00018; Surprisingly, many Americans would take this restructuring further.
0069.00019; The poll found a similar majority backing a workers' fund that received 2% of a firm's equity annually for 25 years  -  meaning that after 25 years every U.S. company with more than 250 workers would have 50% employee ownership.
0069.00020; Shares are a familiar, nonpartisan, capitalist mechanism, said Rutgers University professor Joseph Blasi, director of the university's Rutgers Institute for the Study of Employee Ownership and Profit Sharing and a leading expert on worker issues. Workers get fair wages and a fair share of the profits, in equity or profit shares or both.
0069.00021; The prospect of inclusive ownership funds for employees comes at a pivotal time for American workers.
0069.00022; While a majority of U.S. workers report being satisfied with their jobs and job security overall, polls reveal discontent that employers aren't giving enough of the financial goodies a workplace can provide, especially performance bonuses and promotions that boost a salary.
0069.00023; Moreover, most Americans say they want more than a paycheck they want a stake in their companies.
0069.00024; Surveys indicate a strong preference to work for a business that shares ownership or profits with employees over one that doesn't. Republican or Democrat, young or old, female or male, having a financial share in the company  -  skin in the game  -  evidently makes a commute more worthwhile.
0069.00025; Research shows that private-sector employees with at least some ownership and/or profit-sharing make more money and enjoy better benefits and higher workplace morale than their peers in companies not offering such programs.
0069.00026; In addition, companies that fund employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) improve workers' financial well-being and retirement security.
0069.00027; You don't need to have 100% employee-owned firms to have capital shares improve the middle class, Blasi said.
0069.00028; What you need is an expansion of the reasonable, recognizable share programs that exist in a lot of American companies.
0069.00029; Not only workers benefit. Research also shows that when employees are given equity ownership and profit-sharing, management and outside investors profit too.
0069.00030; Companies that pay attention to their workers' bottom line find the corporate bottom line is stronger, in terms of sales and return on equity.
0069.00031; Plus, workers who own shares are as much as half as likely to leave voluntarily, so a company experiences lower turnover and training costs. Employees care a lot about how much influence they have over day-to-day decisions affecting their job, said Corey Rosen, founder of the National Center for Employee Ownership, a nonpartisan advocacy group in Oakland, Calif.
0069.00032; Companies treat people well, employees generate more ideas, the companies make more money. The best-performing ESOP companies offer financial incentives and respect employees' criticisms and suggestions. That's what makes these [ESOP] plans sing, Rosen said.
0069.00033; Many U.S. companies have gotten the message. Almost half of U.S. private-sector employees, about 59 million workers, have access to ownership or profit-sharing where they work, according to a survey taken by The Rutgers Institute for the Study of Employee Ownership and Profit Sharing. About 25 million Americans own company stock, roughly 14 million of them through an estimated 6,600 ESOPs.
0069.00034; Smaller, privately held companies account for most ESOPs, which also serve as a tax-advantaged way for founders to transfer ownership.
0069.00035; Some larger companies are paragons of employee ownership, including supermarket chains Publix and WinCo Foods, while generous profit-sharing programs are a hallmark of Southwest Airlines   LUV, +1.77%,   Procter & Gamble   PG, -0.46%   and Ford   F, +1.22%,   for example.
0069.00036; Still, less than 10% of ESOP plans are in public companies, and overall, U.S. employees currently control about 8% of America's corporate equity.
0069.00037; Done properly, ESOPs reflect the mutually beneficial interests of workers and business owners. As a result, these plans find support on both sides of the political aisle in Washington.
0069.00038; The law also directs the SBA to encourage owners to sell their business to employees by creating an ESOP.  The vocal discussion and debate about employee ownership and board representation in the private sector is, of course, reflective of the increasing alarm globally about the expanding, cavernous wealth gap between the privileged, comfortable few at or near the top and everyone else  -  and the social and political consequences this growing income inequality has wrought.
0069.00039; In addition to ensuring voting power, inclusive ownership funds, with their guaranteed share of a company's wealth, pledge to do for workers what a universal basic income  -  a guaranteed share of a country's wealth  -  promises the general public: Ease the financial insecurity many people confront day-to-day, paycheck-to-paycheck.
0069.00040; Read: The case for paying every American a dividend on the nation's wealth  In the U.S., for instance, unemployment is historically low, but wage growth for the average worker pales against upper-management's gains.
0069.00041; The Economic Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank with ties to the labor movement, reports that while productivity growth has soared  -  meaning workers are making a solid contribution to company profits  -  wage growth for the rank-and-file has been essentially flat over the past 40 years.
0069.00042; Put more starkly, CEO compensation has risen 940% since 1978, while typical worker compensation is up just 12%, the EPI reports.
0069.00043; The average pay of CEOs at the 350 biggest U.S. firms in 2018 was $17.2 million including cashed-in stock options, which was 278 times the average worker's yearly paycheck.
0069.00044; In contrast, the CEO-to-typical-worker compensation ratio in 1965, also including realized options, was 20-1.
0069.00045; We've had four decades of wage suppression, said Lawrence Mishel, distinguished fellow at EPI and a former president of the organization.
0069.00046; It would be helpful if shareholders and institutional investors took a stronger hand in restraining CEO compensation.
0069.00047; Indeed, Americans are frustrated with CEO pay.
0069.00048; More than 60% believe CEO salaries should be capped  -  at six times the average worker  -  and half said government should restrain CEO compensation, according to a 2016 survey taken by the Rock Center for Corporate Governance at Stanford University. CEOs and corporate directors, not surprisingly, have a different take.
0069.00049; In a companion Rock Center survey of 107 CEOs and directors of Fortune 500 companies, 73% said CEO compensation isn't a problem.
0069.00050; Furthermore, 84% of CEOs believe they are paid correctly compared to the average worker, while only 16% of the general public said the same. Limiting CEO pay was opposed by 79% of chief executives, and 97% of CEOs and directors opposed government intervention in CEO pay practices.
0069.00051; There are people at the top who really need to take a hard look at themselves, said Peter Gowan, a policy associate at The Democracy Collaborative, a left-leaning research group based in Washington, D.C. We can change our ownership structures. Owners would be very wise to recognize that it is impossible for them to concentrate wealth while everyone else's income is stagnating.
0069.00052; Those at the top are responding to such calls.
0069.00053; The American dream is alive, but fraying for many, Dimon declared in his annual letter to JPMorgan Chase shareholders last April.
0069.00054; Dalio has even gone so far to warn America's elite to either step up to help make the system more equitable  -  or be swept up in whatever comes next.
0069.00055; 'A life of meaning and dignity' Americans deserve an economy that allows each person to succeed through hard work and creativity and to lead a life of meaning and dignity.
0069.00056; That's the opening sentence of the Business Roundtable's Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation, signed in August by 181 CEOs of America's biggest and richest corporations, including the leaders of Apple   AAPL, -1.78%,   Bank of America   BAC, +1.69%   and Walmart   WMT, +0.77%.
0069.00057; In its statement, the organization jettisoned the fundamental principle of shareholder primacy  -  the widely held belief that corporations should maximize shareholder value above all. The business group's new thinking is that a company must commit to all of its stakeholders: customers, employees, suppliers and local communities, in addition to shareholders.
0069.00058; Each of our stakeholders is essential, the statement noted. The Business Roundtable's effort depends of course on executives turning words into action.
0069.00059; When it comes to employees, the organization pledged to invest in workers by compensating them fairly and providing important benefits. CEOs also promised skills training and education, along with diversity and inclusion, dignity and respect. But the statement made no mention of treating employees as stakeholders and shareholders, whose financial interest in a firm's success involves both a paycheck and equity shares  -  just as the CEO and other top executives receive.
0069.00060; It's hard to argue that it's the worst thing to grant free shares to employees when it's already being done for top executives, said Blasi, the Rutgers University professor.
0069.00061; As Loren Rodgers, executive director of the National Center for Employee Ownership, commented in a blog post critiquing the Business Roundtable statement: Every business is a supplier and a customer.
0069.00062; Every person is in a community. Most of us are employees.

0071.00001; Published 10 min ago Costco is about to hit new all-time highs, says TradingAnalysis.com founder Todd Gordon . Shares of the big box retailer may have fallen more than 5% from the stock's Sept. 6 record high, but Gordon thinks the charts are signaling another big rally. [Costco has] pulled back to support and I think it's ready to head back to the highs heading into earnings, he said Wednesday on CNBC's Trading Nation.
0071.00002; Costco reports quarterly earnings on Oct. 3. Gordon is looking at a pullback for Costco that took the stock back to the $285 area, which he defines as support given that the level was an old zone that was formerly resistance during the summer.
0071.00003; But Gordon also says the consumer staples sector looks due for a bounce given a pullback to support in the $60.50 area.
0071.00004; We also are seeing falling bond yields in the U.S. again, which will put those dividend payers of the staples back in focus, he added.
0071.00005; Given that implied volatility  -  the price of options  -  is elevated heading into earnings, Gordon plans to sell the Oct. 4 290-strike put and buy the Oct. 4 285-strike put for a credit of $1.98. This means that should Costco close above $290 on Oct. 4 expiration, then Gordon would make $198 on the trade.
0071.00006; If Costco closes below $285 on expiration, then Gordon would lose about $302.
0071.00007; Despite the skewed risk reward ratio, Gordon's 290-strike put is essentially in the money , given that Costco was trading at around $287 on Wednesday. The stock is up 30 percent year to date.

0072.00001; SPEECH  Welcome address by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, to the Money Market Contact Group Frankfurt am Main, 24 September 2019  In its most recent policy meeting, the ECB's Governing Council decided on a comprehensive easing package because the downward revisions in the projected inflation path warranted a vigorous policy response.
0072.00002; The easing package comprised five measures: lowering the deposit facility rate, strengthening the forward guidance on the likely path of policy rates, restarting the net asset purchases within the asset purchase programme, changing the terms of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) and introducing a two-tier system for reserve remuneration.
0072.00003; We believe that the measures announced last week complement each other and together constitute an effective response to the environment that the ECB currently faces. These decisions were taken against the following background.
0072.00004; First, as a result of continued global uncertainties and their impact on confidence, our latest ECB staff macroeconomic projections were revised down.
0072.00005; We face a more protracted economic slowdown than previously anticipated and see persistent downside risks to the growth outlook.
0072.00006; Second, inflation continues to fall short of expectations. Headline inflation remains well below our medium-term aim, while core inflation has been hovering around 1% for an extended period of time.
0072.00007; Market-based indicators of future inflation outcomes have stagnated at historical lows and the profile for headline inflation has been revised down, leading to a further delay in the convergence of inflation towards our aim.
0072.00008; The case for a monetary policy response was clear and a comprehensive package of measures was judged to be the most effective response.
0072.00009; I will take this opportunity to delve a little deeper into two of the measures that may be especially relevant for the banking sector. The first is the changes to some of the parameters of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations  -  TLTRO III  -  and the second is the implementation of a two-tier system for the remuneration of excess reserves.
0072.00010; You may recall that TLTRO III was announced in March to preserve the very favourable bank lending conditions in the euro area and to ensure the smooth transmission of our highly accommodative monetary policy stance. At the same time, indexing the TLTRO III rates to the main refinancing operations rate and the deposit facility rate implies that, should the ECB adjust these key interest rates, the average funding conditions under the programme would be correspondingly adjusted for banks, thus helping to align this programme with the broader monetary policy stance.
0072.00011; The Governing Council made clear that the modalities of TLTRO III would take into account a thorough assessment of the bank-based transmission channel of monetary policy, as well as developments in the economic outlook.
0072.00012; The recent deterioration in the economic outlook prompted us to ease several of the terms of the new operations. The Governing Council decided to eliminate the 10 basis point spread over the key policy rates entailed in the initial pricing of the operations.
0072.00013; In addition, the maturity of the operations was extended from two to three years, and an early repayment option after two years was introduced.
0072.00014; The adjustments to the TLTRO III parameters signal that the Governing Council can act in an agile manner and fine-tune its monetary policy instruments, as needed, to ensure that they are efficient, effective and proportionate to the risks to price stability.
0072.00015; We believe that these changes represent a significant easing of banks' medium-term funding conditions, which in turn should contribute to improving the lending conditions banks offer to the real economy.
0072.00016; The more accommodative pricing should strengthen support for bank funding, so that banks continue to offer loans to firms and households on favourable terms.
0072.00017; The extended maturity of TLTRO III will be better aligned with bank-based financing of investment projects, thereby further supporting banks' financing to the real economy. Finally, in view of the lengthened maturity, the option to voluntarily repay the amounts borrowed before maturity at a quarterly frequency will provide greater flexibility for banks' funding plans.
0072.00018; The two-tier system Let me now turn to the second measure.
0072.00019; Banks in the euro area continue to benefit from the negative interest rate policy through the larger intermediation volumes and lower credit risk for borrowers associated with more favourable macroeconomic developments.
0072.00020; This has helped support bank profitability across the euro area since the deposit facility rate turned negative in 2014.
0072.00021; In addition, banks have been able to generate higher non-interest income as the compression of yields is reflected in higher asset valuations.
0072.00022; Banks' funding costs in wholesale markets have also decreased, mitigating the impact of lower rates on net interest income.
0072.00023; However, the negative interest rate policy also entails costs for banks, and these are likely to increase the longer negative rates are in place, the lower policy rates are set and the larger the amount of excess liquidity.
0072.00024; The Governing Council therefore decided to introduce a two-tier system for reserve remuneration in order to ensure that the accommodative monetary policy stance continues to translate into favourable lending conditions, which is particularly important given that the European economy is largely bank-based.
0072.00025; Under the two-tier system, part of each bank's holdings of excess liquidity will be exempt from the negative deposit facility rate. The size of the exempted part of a bank's reserve accounts will initially be six times its minimum reserve requirement.
0072.00026; This strikes a balance between two outcomes.
0072.00027; It offsets the direct cost of negative interest rates on banks' profitability, thereby helping to sustain the pass-through of low policy rates to bank lending.
0072.00028; And it also preserves the positive contribution of negative rates to the accommodative stance of monetary policy and the continued sustained convergence of inflation to our aim.
0072.00029; There are several reasons why the initial value chosen for the multiplier was six times a bank's minimum reserve requirement.
0072.00030; First, it provides banks with some relief from negative rates.
0072.00031; Based on current holdings of excess liquidity, the current calibration will entail annual savings for banks of about €4 billion.
0072.00032; Second, it leaves the volume of non-exempt excess liquidity which is still remunerated at the deposit facility rate at a level which is sufficiently large to ensure that money market rates remain anchored to the ECB deposit facility rate.
0072.00033; Given that minimum reserves are currently close to €130 billion, the exempt tier would amount to some €800 billion, implying that the non-exempt amount of excess reserves still remunerated at the negative deposit facility rate would be approximately €1 trillion, down from €1.8 trillion.
0072.00034; Third, it dampens the risk of money market rates becoming subject to upward pressure due to the potential redistribution of excess liquidity among market participants to fill exemption allowances.
0072.00035; For example, the system may induce banks that have an unused exempt tier to increase the amount they borrow from banks that hold more excess liquidity than their exempt tier.
0072.00036; If such transactions were to occur at higher rates than before, then we may see upward pressure on certain money market rates.
0072.00037; At this stage, we see very little evidence of this being priced in by the market, but the ECB will continue to actively monitor conditions in the money market.
0072.00038; Allow me to conclude. On 12 September the Governing Council decided on one of the most broad-based packages of monetary stimulus measures to date.
0072.00039; Of the five measures in the overall package, the two that I have discussed today may be particularly relevant for banks.
0072.00040; These are the modification of the terms of TLTRO III and the introduction of a two-tier system for reserve remuneration given banks' important role in monetary policy transmission.
0072.00041; Both measures will serve to mitigate the risk that the possible side effects of the ECB's accommodative monetary policy stance on bank-based intermediation could undermine the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim. We are aiming to preserve favourable bank lending conditions in the euro area to further support the accommodative stance of monetary policy and ensure it is smoothly transmitted to the real economy.
0073.00001; Here are a few tips on how to act if you are a PMC Bank customer, as well as advice on how to bank prudently. Hiral Thanawala @thanawala_hiral  On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) imposed strict restrictions on the Mumbai-based, Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank (PMC).
0073.00002; As per the RBI circular, PMC Bank has been barred from carrying out a majority of its routine business transactions for six months. The restrictions, which extend to both lending and withdrawals, mean a customer can withdraw only Rs 1,000 once over the entire six months period from savings or current account or any other deposit account accounts.
0073.00003; While on the face of it, PMC Bank is a profitable bank with a low NPA figure, it is likely that there have been irregularities, which warranted such drastic action.
0073.00004; Close  The shock move by the RBI has led to heartburn for citizens who hold accounts with the bank. For instance, Rewadhar Tiwari, 82, a senior citizen residing in Mumbai has maintained an account with PMC Bank for over 20 years. Nearly all his savings and retirement proceeds, amounting to Rs 2.5 lakh, are now stuck as fixed deposits.
0073.00005; I never opened an account with any other bank since it was accessible from my place and the service was good.
0073.00006; Also, I knew the branch staff well since I had an account for a long time, he said. Rupal Gune, 47, broke down after hearing the news.
0073.00007; She had kept a deposit of Rs 2 lakh with an intention to cover her children's school fees.
0073.00008; Whether you are a PMC Bank customer, or if you have an account with any other cooperative bank, here are a few tips on how to deal with the ongoing crisis, as well as advice on how to go about your banking business. Don't panic  Just because the RBI has imposed restrictions on PMC Bank, it does not mean that the bank is going under. When RBI imposes a restriction on withdrawals from your account with a co-operative bank don't panic immediately and rush to bank for withdrawal of amount from savings and deposits.
0073.00009; A retail banker, requesting anonymity said,  The bank will not go into bankruptcy immediately, says a retail banker requesting anonymity. The RBI's intent with the imposition of lending and withdrawal curbs is to stop any harmful practice and give the bank the time to repair its financial situation. What happens with your deposit?
0073.00010; Even in an extreme situation, if a bank were to go under, deposits with all banks are guaranteed under the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) to the tune of Rs 1 lakh, including interest. This means that amounts over Rs 1 lakh could be at risk in the rare situation that a bank collapses.
0073.00011; Impact on EMI, SIP payments, ECS mandates  Customers may have linked their PMC Bank accounts for making automatic payments such as equated monthly installments (EMIs), systematic investment plan (SIP) in mutual fund schemes, insurance premiums or utility bills.
0073.00012; Your PMC account will not be debited, says Amol Joshi, founder of financial advisory firm Plan Rupee Investment Services, advising that customers immediately register fresh ECS mandates with a different bank account for such payments to be cleared.
0073.00013; Customers that have linked a PMC Bank account with their mutual fund or demat account to receive dividends and redemption proceeds will also not do so.
0073.00014; The registrar and transfer agents of mutual fund houses will screen the database of investors for PMC Bank account holders and pay-out won't be released for them till customers link a fresh account or the RBI lifts its curbs,  Fund houses will request investors having PMC Bank accounts to link new bank account details, says Joshi. Account-holders: Do not put all your eggs in one basket  Several customers tend to hold one bank account throughout their life.
0073.00015; In cases like PMC, such savings of a lifetime can get stuck even if for a short period. Financial advisors thus say that savers should hold multiple bank accounts -- about 2-3 -- from a mix of co-operative banks, private banks and public sector undertaking (PSU). Customers should be wary of banking heavily with cooperative banks even if they offer higher deposit rates or have a more relaxed account opening process.
0073.00016; Many co-operative banks are controlled by politicians and may not have strong managements, warns Joydeep Sen, Independent Financial Advisor of wiseinvestor.in.
0073.00017; No more than 10% of your financial assets should be parked with a co-operative banks, says Vishal Dhawan, certified financial planner, and founder Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors. Cooperative bank or a cooperative credit society? Customers should also be sure as to which institution they are dealing with: cooperative bank or cooperative credit society.
0073.00018; The former are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India while the latter are regulated by state governments.
0073.00019; Further, the Rs 1 lakh deposit coverage guarantee does not exist in case of credit cooperative societies. It is therefore advisable to deal with a cooperative bank rather than a cooperative credit society.
0073.00020; Beware of bank identity fraud  There have also been instances where financial institutions operating in small cities partly change their name to sound or look similar to a popular bank. Yoy should check the name of the bank you are dealing with on the RBI website to make sure you are dealing with an RBI-regulated entity and not some local body running a financial institution with a similar sounding name, says Sen.

0074.00002; The government had made the provision of levying 2 per cent TDS on cash withdrawals exceeding Rs 1 crore in the Union Budget with an aim to discourage cash transactions and move towards a less-cash economy.
0074.00003; The provision is set to come into force from October 1.  Addressing the concerns raised by Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs), it has been decided not to levy the 2% TDS on cash payments above Rs 1 crore made through APMCs, in order to make immediate payments to farmers for their produce, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in a tweet.
0074.00004; Meanwhile, in another tweet, the minister said an additional 15 per cent depreciation will be allowed on motor vehicles purchased between August 23, 2019, and March 31, 2020. She had made this announcement on August 23 as part of measures to boost the economy. The move is expected to give a boost to the automobile sector by driving sales, she added.
0074.00005; The depreciation on cars purchased during the period will be 30 per cent as against the normal rate of 15 per cent.
0074.00006; While in the case of buses, lorries and taxis, the depreciation rate has been enhanced to 45 per cent from 30 per cent.

0075.00001; Hydro aims to lift cash flows and returns with extensive improvement and restructuring efforts across its business areas, while highlighting sustainability as a basis for the company's positioning. These will be the key topics at the Hydro Investor Day 2019.
0075.00002; At this year's event, Hydro will present its strategic direction, including new improvement efforts, updated capital allocation framework and clear targets for profitability and sustainability. The ambitions are underpinned by a capital returns target of 10% RoaCE over the cycle, as well as an ambition to reduce already competitive CO2 emissions in own production and processes by further 30% by 2030. Moreover, there will be an update on the Alunorte situation, Rolled Products restructuring and market outlook.
0075.00003; We are launching new improvement efforts across the company, representing NOK 6.4 billion in EBIT improvements over the next five years, in addition to NOK 0.9 billion targeted in Rolled Products over the same time period.
0075.00004; The improvements include the curtailment reversal of the Brazilian assets. The efforts also include simplification of staff functions and a revised operating model to support our profitability and sustainability agenda, says Hilde Merete Aasheim, President and CEO. Hydro's strategic priorities are to have cost-competitive assets, based on operational excellence, strong market positions, capitalizing on innovation and differentiating on sustainable products and processes.
0075.00005; By actively managing its portfolio and strictly allocating capital in line with the strategic priorities, Hydro aims to ensure a more stable earnings profile, while also strengthening sustainability positions throughout the value chain.
0075.00006; Furthermore, to effectively allocate capital, Hydro has identified strategic modes for each business area ranging from sustain and improve in the upstream business areas Bauxite & Alumina and Primary Metal, to selective growth in Extruded Solutions and Energy, while Rolled Products is under strategic review and restructuring.
0075.00007; We have a strong foundation in place to achieve our ambitions.
0075.00008; Going forward, we will be focusing on what we can influence ourselves to achieve the set targets, both when it comes to profitability and sustainability.
0075.00009; We have the right people, technology and capabilities.
0075.00010; Now it's time to execute in order to improve the robustness of the company, being a profitable industry leader based on innovation and sustainability, says Aasheim. Hydro's CEO Hilde Merete Aasheim. The Federal Court lifted the embargo on Alunorte's new bauxite residue disposal (DRS2) under the civil lawsuit on September 20.
0075.00011; Alunorte is still subject to an embargo on DRS2 imposed by the same court in a parallel criminal lawsuit, but Alunorte is expecting an extension of the civil decision to the criminal case shortly. In the meantime, ramp-up at Alunorte and Paragominas is progressing well, aiming to produce at 75-85% capacity for the rest of 2019.
0075.00012; With an additional press filter in operation at the end of the year, production will be further optimized towards full capacity in 2021. Albras is expected to complete the ramp-up in 2019 with all the electrolysis cells to be restarted by the end of Q3. On a per tonne basis, fixed costs in Bauxite & Alumina and Primary Metal are expected to return to the pre-curtailment levels once the ramp-up is fully completed.
0075.00013; This is an important step forward.
0075.00014; Returning Alunorte, Paragominas and Albras to full production and achieving operational excellence is an important part of our business moving forward.
0075.00015; We have a good, ongoing dialog with the relevant stakeholders, and are now awaiting the court's decision, says Aasheim. Hydro has initiated a strategic review and comprehensive restructuring of the Rolled Products business area to mitigate the declining profitability the business has faced over the last years. The aim is to significantly turn this development around by lifting organizational and operational efficiency as well as shifting the product portfolio away from declining markets and towards growth markets like automotive and can.
0075.00016; The target is a NOK 0.9 billion improvement by 2023.
0075.00017; These improvements will be realized, while also continuing the strategic review of the Rolled Products business. We have initiated strong measures in restructuring the Rolled Products business area. We see that our products are well perceived by customers and we have to turn this competitive advantage into increased profitability, says Aasheim.
0075.00018; Hydro is launching a new climate strategy aiming to cut emissions in sourcing and own processes by 30% by 2030. Cutting our emissions is an important part of our goal to drive sustainability.
0075.00019; In 2013, we set an ambitious target to become the first carbon neutral aluminium company from a lifecycle perspective by 2020.
0075.00020; Now, when our 2020 target is within reach, we are setting a new ambition for cutting our own emissions by 30% by 2030, says Aasheim.
0075.00021; Hydro's new certified low-carbon product brands CIRCAL and REDUXA are setting a new standard for low-carbon and recycled aluminium, thereby commercializing the company's sustainability position.
0075.00022; The initial customer feedback and subsequent orders have underlined the potential for these types of products that represent exciting opportunities moving forward.
0075.00023; Hydro is committed to driving long-term value for our shareholders.
0075.00024; To strengthen the focus on profitability the company has introduced a 10% RoaCE target for the total company, while all business areas aim to deliver RoaCE above their differentiated cost of capital.
0075.00025; Hydro will continue to prioritize a strong balance sheet and an investment grade credit rating, as well as delivering competitive returns to shareholders.
0075.00026; Hydro will maintain shareholder focus with a dividend policy of returning 40% of net income over the cycle, with a dividend floor of NOK 1.25 per share. Ensuring disciplined capital allocation is key to deliver on return requirements, with growth projects to be aligned with strategic priorities, and sustaining capex to be maintained at competitive and affordable levels.
0075.00027; Sustaining capex for 2019 and 2020 combined is estimated at around NOK 12.5-13.5 billion, representing around 1 BNOK reduction compared to the previous guidance for the same period. The reduction represents short-term optimization, while further measures to ensure long-term competitive sustaining capex are in process. Total capex for 2019-2020 is estimated at NOK 19.5 billion.
0075.00028; The company set out a target to release net operating capital by NOK 4 billion by end of 2020 compared to end of 2018, of which the majority will be released by end 2019.  Published: September 24, 2019  
0076.00001; Variable universal life insurance is permanent life insurance - it remains in force for the policyholder's whole life.
0076.00002; And, as with universal life insurance, it provides a flexible premium and an adjustable benefit - meaning the policyholder decides how much to put in the policy above a set minimum.
0076.00003; By extension, the policyholder also determines the face amount of the policy.
0076.00004; The difference between variable universal life insurance and other types of permanent insurance is that the policyholder directs how premiums are invested.
0076.00005; This provides access to the potentially higher returns provided by the financial markets.
0076.00006; It also means returns could underperform those provided by other life insurance products.
0076.00007; Generally, there are several subaccounts in which the policyholder may choose to invest.
0076.00008; There may be a fixed-interest option as well as various stock, bond, or money-market choices.
0076.00009; Guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the issuing company. Like other types of permanent life insurance, policyholders can even borrow a portion of their policy's cash value under fairly favorable terms.
0076.00010; And interest payments on policy loans go directly back into the policy's cash value.When the policyholder dies, his or her beneficiaries receive the benefit from the policy. Depending on how the policy is structured, benefits may or may not be taxable. Variable universal life insurance has unique features that may be attractive to some insurance buyers.
0076.00011; However, a variable universal life insurance policy also has options that must be clearly understood before an individual commits to a policy. Generally, loans taken from a policy will be free of current income taxes provided certain conditions are met, such as the policy does not lapse or mature.
0076.00012; Keep in mind that loans and withdrawals reduce the policy's cash value and death benefit.
0076.00013; Loans also increase the possibility that the policy may lapse.
0076.00014; If the policy lapses, matures, or is surrendered, the loan balance will be considered a distribution and will be taxable.
0076.00015; Accessing the cash value in your insurance policy through borrowing - or partial surrenders - has the potential to reduce the policy's cash value and benefit.
0076.00016; Accessing the cash value may also increase the chance that the policy will lapse and may result in a tax liability if the policy terminates before your death.
0076.00017; Variable universal life insurance can be structured so that the cash value that accumulates will eventually cover the premiums. However, additional out-of-pocket payments may be required if the policy's dividend decreases or if investment returns underperform.
0076.00018; Several factors will affect the cost and availability of life insurance, including age, health, and the type and amount of insurance purchased.
0076.00019; Life insurance policies have expenses, including mortality and other charges.
0076.00020; If a policy is surrendered prematurely, the policyholder also may pay surrender charges and have income tax implications.
0076.00021; You should consider determining whether you are insurable before implementing a strategy involving life insurance.
0076.00022; Any guarantees associated with a policy are dependent on the ability of the issuing insurance company to continue making claim payments. Withdrawals of earnings are fully taxable at ordinary income tax rates.
0076.00023; If you are under age 59½ when you make the withdrawal, you may be subject to surrender charges and assessed a 10% federal income tax penalty.
0076.00024; Also, withdrawals will reduce the benefits and value of the contract.
0076.00025; Life insurance is not FDIC insured.
0076.00026; It is not insured by any federal government agency or bank or savings association. Depending on the performance of variable life and variable universal life insurance, the account value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. At any time, the account value may be worth more or less than the original amount invested in the policy.
0076.00027; Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses before investing.
0076.00028; Variable life and variable universal life insurance are sold by prospectus only.

0079.00001; ETF Analysis | Financials | United Kingdom  BDCL And Its 16.7% Yield Might Warrant Your Consideration |  About: ETRACS 2xLeveraged Long Wells Fargo Business Development Company (BDCL), Includes: CEFL, LBDC, MORL, MRRL, REML, SMHB, SMHD  by: Lance Brofman  Lance Brofman  Debt, REITs, macro, ETF investing  Summary  Comparisons of BDCL with the other 2x Leveraged High-Yield ETNs can be misleading.
0079.00002; This is due to the way that expenses are accounted for.
0079.00003; Expenses and fees are deducted from the net indicative (asset) value of the other 2x Leveraged High-Yield ETN, rather than from the dividends for BDCL.
0079.00004; The diversification provided by ETNs reduces much of the risk associated with individual companies. However, systemic risk still exists and appears to be growing.
0079.00005; Trade policies and Iran war risk are the most serious systematic risks now. Why Consider BDCL Again?
0079.00006; The primary reason to buy any of the 2x Leveraged High-Yield ETNs, such as the UBS ETRACS 2x Leveraged Long Wells Fargo® Business Development Company ETN (NYSEARCA:BDCL), is the high current yields. I have written about my portfolio where the most important constraint is to only include securities with current yields above 15%.
0079.00007; Other constraints are the typical retail IRA account restrictions which preclude the use of short-selling, margin borrowing, most options strategies and futures contracts. Some brokerage firms also impose additional constraints on IRA accounts.
0079.00008; I suspect that there are many individuals, particularly those either partially or totally retired, who either have somewhat similar constraints or might possibly benefit from adopting them. There is nothing magic about the 15%+ current yield threshold.
0079.00009; Originally, in 2001, it was a 10% current yield threshold.
0079.00010; It reached 30% in 2008 and 60% in March 2009.
0079.00011; I mainly use 2x Leveraged High-Yield ETNs in order to put my macroeconomic projections to use, in the investment arena, while sticking to my 15%+ current yield constraint.
0079.00012; Other than junk bonds and other securities issued by individual distressed entities, 2x Leveraged High-Yield ETNs are about the only game in town to obtain current yields above 15%.
0079.00013; BDCL has been the lowest yielding of the 2x Leveraged High-Yield ETNs that I follow.
0079.00014; UBS ETRACS Monthly Pay 2xLeveraged US Small Cap High Dividend ETN Series B (SMHB), which is based on the same index as SMHD but has some differences and the Credit Suisse X-Links Monthly Pay 2x Leveraged Mortgage REIT ETN (NYSEARCA: REML). BDCL also has an identical twin: the UBS ETRACS 2×Leveraged Long ETRACS Wells Fargo® Business Development Company Index ETN Series B (LBDC), which is very thinly traded.
0079.00015; While the current yield on BDCL has been lower than those of the other 2x Leveraged High-Yield ETNs, and at times at or below the 15% threshold, comparisons with the other 2x Leveraged High-Yield ETNs can be misleading. This is due to the fact that expenses and fees are deducted from the net indicative (asset) value of the other 2x Leveraged High-Yield ETN, rather than the income.
0079.00016; In contrast, BDCL expenses and fees are deducted from the dividends.
0079.00017; While typically called dividends, the payments from the 2X-leveraged ETNs are technically distributions of interest payments on the ETN notes based on the dividends paid by the underlying securities that comprise the index, pursuant to the terms of the indenture.
0079.00018; Taking expenses and fees from the net indicative (asset) value of the other 2x Leveraged High-Yield ETN, rather than the income, will over time, reduce the net indicative (asset) value of those Leveraged High-Yield ETNs. The lower net indicative (asset) value.
0079.00019; will in turn reduce the dividends. This is separate and distinct from any return of capital associated with some of closed-end funds that comprise the index upon which CEFL is based.
0079.00020; This factor was relatively very small when 3-month LIBOR was only 0.25% from 2010 through 2015.
0079.00021; However, with 3-month LIBOR now at 2.75%, it is more significant.
0079.00022; For example, the CEFL dividend yield on an annualized monthly compounded basis is now 19.75%, based on my projection of the March 2019 CEFL monthly dividend of $0.2547.
0079.00023; That calculation is based on a projected annual CEFL dividend of $2.567. Adding the financing expense of 3.15% to the 0.50% annual tracking fee brings total expenses, including interest to 3.65%.
0079.00024; If that was taken out of the dividends, rather than the net indicative value, the projected annualized monthly compounded basis would be 16.1%....
0079.00025; Even though as is explained in Applying Net Present Values And Internal Rates Of Return To 2X-Leveraged ETNs Yielding More Than 20%  ...Deducting the fees and expenses from income rather than principal would not impact the actual returns received from investing in 2x Leveraged High-Yield ETNs.
0079.00026; The expected decline over time of the net indicative (asset) value and dividends is a consideration.
0079.00027; However, once the magnitude of this factor is understood, it should not be much of an impediment to investing in these 2x Leveraged High-Yield ETNs... ...there are some investors who are uncomfortable with the fact that deducting expenses and fees are from the net indicative (asset) value means that it is unlikely that 2X Leveraged Mortgage REIT ETNs will pay their $25 face value at maturity.
0079.00028; BDCL expenses and fees are deducted from the dividends.
0079.00029; That does not mean that BDCL shares cannot go down.
0079.00030; From its first trading day on May 25, 2011 the price of BDCL has declined from $25.52 to $14.59 as of September 17, 2019.
0079.00031; However, the total return, assuming reinvestment of dividends was 116.10%.
0079.00032; That is a 9.70% average annual return over that 8.32 year period.
0079.00033; The total dividends of $26.67 per share more than offset the decline in share price.
0079.00034; Even without counting any reinvestment of dividends the total return was 61.67%.
0079.00035; That is a 5.94% average annual return over that 8.32 year period. Additionally, as described in my July 11, 2013, Seeking Alpha article, A Depression With Benefits: The Macro Case For mREITs, my premise was that government policies shifting the tax burden from the rich and onto the middle class results in much more funds being available for investment relative to productive uses for those investable funds.
0079.00036; That tends to put downward pressure on interest rates.
0079.00037; These two articles were the basis for my view that interest rates would be lower and for longer than was the then current consensus.
0079.00038; Many market participants thought that the Federal Reserve would continue raising rates for much longer than they actually have done.
0079.00039; Those market participants also did not think that as of September 18, 2019, the Federal Reserve would have cut short-term rates two times. More interesting to me.
0079.00040; is that on September 17, 2019 the Federal Reserve attempted to lower short-term rates using repurchase agreements. The Federal Reserve apparently ran into technical difficulties when doing so, because they had not attempted to lower rates in that manner for many years.
0079.00041; So much for the argument that the Federal Reserve was artificially depressing interest rates.
0079.00042; As might be expected on September 18, 2019, the Federal Reserve did not explicitly say that there would be any further rate cuts.
0079.00043; However, now many market participants think otherwise.
0079.00044; Interest rates, specifically 3-month LIBOR, are the major expense that is taken out of the BDCL dividend.
0079.00045; That rate has already fallen from 2.75% to 2.13% as of September 17, 2019.
0079.00046; It should be noted that when comparing BDCL to the other 2x Leveraged High-Yield ETNs, the relatively high 0.85% BDCL tracking fee is somewhat offset by the fact that the implicit interest expense on the BDCL leverage is just 3-month LIBOR with no add-on. For CEFL the tracking fee is only 0.50%, but the financing expense is 3-month LIBOR plus 0.40%.  The business development companies that comprise the index upon which BDCL is based are probably more vulnerable to slowing economic growth or a recession than the mREITs in the indices that MORL, MRRL and REML are based on. Agency mortgage-backed securities generally have no credit risk.
0079.00047; The closed-end funds that the index that CEFL is based on, in some cases, contain securities with significant credit risk, such as junk bonds or risky common stocks that could be impacted slowing economic growth or a recession. The index that SMHD and SMHB are based on contains some mREITs but also risky high-dividend yield common stocks.
0079.00048; Another possible consideration is that the actual holdings of the business development companies that comprise the index upon which BDCL is based are generally more opaque than the holdings of mREITs and closed-end fund.
0079.00049; The mortgage-backed securities and other instruments held by mREITs are generally actively traded which allows analysis of the individual mREIT portfolios.
0079.00050; The closed-end funds that the index that CEFL is based on, mostly own publicly traded securities, and in all cases only own securities who price can be ascertained every business day, as the closed-end funds must report their net asset values daily.
0079.00051; The risky high-dividend yield common stocks, as well as the mREITs in the index that SMHD and SMHB is based on, are all listed on major exchanges and report the financials as is required of such securities.
0079.00052; In most cases there is very little easily obtainable information about the individual investments made by the business development companies that comprise the index upon which BDCL is based.
0079.00053; The diversification provided by ETNs reduces much of the risk associated with individual securities. However, systemic risk still exists and appears to be growing.
0079.00054; As was discussed in Trump's Trade Policies: America's Brexit?, concern that Trump's trade policies could cause an economic collapse are well founded. In mREITs Are Underperforming As Interest Rates Decline.
0079.00055; Why?
0079.00056; I said:  ...For those who might want to consider how bad things could really get, consider this thought experiment: Imagine that sometime in the last twenty years, an analyst at the Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China approached their superior with this idea: How about we have China accumulate trillions in holdings of sovereign and similar risk-free debt securities, mostly American treasuries, and then do something which collapses the world economy. Then, China can use its hoard of bonds to buy up assets around the world at distress prices. Assume the superior then takes that suggestion to the parent agency of the Ministry of Finance, which is the State Council of the People's Republic of China.
0079.00057; After some discussion, the State Council concludes that the analyst at the Ministry of Finance had an interesting idea.
0079.00058; However, the negative consequences to China that could occur if the rest of the world thought that China had engineered a collapse of the world economy, made the idea too risky.
0079.00059; Now fast forward this thought experiment to 2019 and assume the State Council is trying to decide on how to respond to Trump's trade war.
0079.00060; They might decide to dust off the analysts' idea to utilize their bonds to buy up assets around the world.
0079.00061; All they would have to do was to pretend to be working toward an agreement, but never quite reach one. This would allow Trump and the United States to take the blame for the collapse of the world economy, that ensued.
0079.00062; That scenario may be far-fetched.
0079.00063; A more likely outcome is that hundreds of years from now, Trump is only remembered as the president who started and lost a trade war. What would signal that Trump lost the trade war? That would be when China and much of the G20 countries enter into a comprehensive multinational trade agreement where the USA is excluded.
0079.00064; Many foreign leaders detest that Trump has reneged on agreements signed by previous American presidents, such as the Iran nuclear deal.
0079.00065; This is true even if some of them have some sympathy for some of Trump's arguments.
0079.00066; China and many other countries remember that when China joined the WTO, it agreed to considerably harsher conditions than other developing countries.
0079.00067; President Clinton and, then later, Bush forced China to accept changes in China's economy and trading practices, before agreeing to allow China into the WTO, that were considerably stricter than were imposed on any other country previously or since.
0079.00068; That Trump is essentially now trying to force new changes in China's economy and trading practices irks many world leaders.
0079.00069; That includes those world leaders whose view is that China's development since it was admitted to the WTO in December 2001 suggests that some additional reforms by China are now appropriate.
0079.00070; A similar result, in terms of the isolation of America and subsequent reduction in American living standards, could occur if Trump withdraws from the World Trade Organization.
0079.00071; Trump might quit the World Trade Organization in response the enormous financial penalties that will be imposed on America for the tariffs Trump has already imposed. Those tariffs constitute blatant violations of WTO regulations.
0079.00072; Those cases, which have already been filed, are now slowly working their way through the World Trade Organization adjudication process.
0079.00073; Included in the pending cases is the case just filed by China regarding the new additional tariffs that took effect on September 1, 2019...
0079.00074; Developments involving Iran, suggest a possible even more dire possibility.
0079.00075; It is now apparent that President Obama and the leaders of the six other major countries that signed the 2015 Nuclear Agreement with Iran, took into consideration or were at least informed by their top military advisers, of Iran's military capabilities when determining that signing the agreement was preferable than trying to have a war to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.
0079.00076; While President Trump was not alone in criticizing the 2015 Nuclear Agreement with Iran, he appears not to have given the weight to the consequences that reneging on an agreement could entail, that many other critics of the agreement probably would have given. Many of the other critics of the 2015 Nuclear Agreement may not have reneged on an agreement in place.
0079.00077; Trump is absolutely correct that America alone could totally defeat Iran in any war.
0079.00078; America could also have totally defeated the communists in Vietnam.
0079.00079; However, in terms of willing to accept ongoing casualties for a prolonged basis, the communists in Vietnam had the upper hand.
0079.00080; Trump's critics in America and abroad never miss an opportunity to assert that if Trump had not chosen to withdraw from the 2015 Nuclear Agreement and impose sanctions, there would be not now be the possibility of hostilities.
0079.00081; In: MORL-MRRL Spread Hits An All-Time High.
0079.00082; Opportunities In The 20%+ Current Yield ETNs, I said:  ...The situation with Iran is extremely difficult to predict.
0079.00083; It appears that Iran is playing their extremely weak hand, with great skill. This contrasts with Trump's squandering much of the American advantages of overwhelming military and economic power, previously amplified by strong alliances. All of Iran's moves so far seem to be well thought out.
0079.00084; Iran is slowly increasing its uranium enrichment, and will exceed the levels specified in the 2015 Nuclear Agreement.
0079.00085; If the 2015 Nuclear Agreement was still intact with American still adhering to it, Iran would not now be increasing its uranium enrichment. World opinion now is mostly that Trumps' withdrawn 2015 Nuclear Agreement and punishing economic sanctions against Iran, have left Iran with little choice now, but to take some action.
0079.00086; Trump and others' view that sanctions would force Iran to quickly renegotiate a new deal were very unrealistic and are now putting Trump in a very poor position.
0079.00087; Trump's critics and opponents will be pointing out that Iran is now increasing its uranium enrichment as a direct result of Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 Nuclear Agreement.
0079.00088; Trump knows that if a shooting war with Iran occurs, he will be blamed for all American losses and for causing a war that could have been avoided simply by adhering to the Nuclear Agreement. A major point made by opponent of the 2015 Nuclear Agreement, was that at its expiration Iran could have resumed uranium enrichment.
0079.00089; A costly war would emphasize the fact that but-for Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 Nuclear Agreement, that war could have been avoided.
0079.00090; When the 2015 Nuclear Agreement expired in the future, if necessary, that could be dealt with by a united front of all of the signatories to 2015 Nuclear Agreement.
0079.00091; Iran has played its very weak hand smartly, by signaling that any war will be very costly. First, Iran demonstrated that it can attack targets such as oil tankers, in such a way that it cannot be definitely proved that Iran was responsible.
0079.00092; Next, Iran shot down a $176 million RQ-4 Global Hawk surveillance drone. American military forces and their allies are still fighting opponents Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria as well as minor actions in Africa.
0079.00093; A great advantage that American military forces and their allies have, is provided by surveillance drones. The Taliban, Al-Qaida, Isis and other enemies would have loved to shoot down a Global Hawk surveillance drone, and thus possibly, temporarily deny American military forces the great advantage the Global Hawk provides.
0079.00094; However, shooting down a Global Hawk was far beyond their capabilities, as the RQ-4 flies far above the range of ordinary anti-aircraft weapons . Iran signaled that it can shoot down RQ-4 Global Hawks.
0079.00095; Iran says it was over Iranian territorial waters at the time.
0079.00096; The Americans say it was in international waters.
0079.00097; Many nations that in the past would automatically accept America's version of such events, have expressed doubt as to which side is correct.
0079.00098; This illustrates the degree that Trump has reduced America's credibility in the world. To the extent that the Global Hawk was further from Iran, than Iran asserts, it suggests that Iran can shoot down Global Hawks at a greater distance from its territory.
0079.00099; This demonstrates that any ground war in Iran will likely have to be fought without some of the advantages that Global Hawk provides against less sophisticated opponents.
0079.00100; If America's allies were even considering aiding an effort to invade Iran, this makes them less likely to participate in such a potentially costly undertaking. While, Iran's military is no match for even America without any allies, invading and occupying Iran could make the fiasco of the second US-Iraq war look like a picnic. Military experts are almost unanimous that the only way to eliminate Iran's nuclear capability would require forces on the ground.
0079.00101; Simply employing air strikes, armed drones and/or missiles could not assure the destruction of the hundreds of well-hidden underground nuclear facilities...
0079.00102; The recent demonstration by Iran that it can do serious damage with drones and cruise missiles, has given Trump and Saudi Arabia reasons pause and seriously consider the costs of any retaliation they might otherwise consider.
0079.00103; It is likely that Trump's decision to call off the air strikes against Iran in retaliation for downing the RQ-4 Global Hawk, was motivated less by concern for casualties in Iran, as Trump claimed, but rather by fear of possible American losses that Iran's newly shown antiaircraft capabilities, suggested could occur during those strikes, had they taken place.
0079.00104; It appears that Trump's response to the very significant damage to the oil facilities in Saudi Arabia will be more sanctions, on top of the current maximum sanctions already in place.
0079.00105; If there is no military response to this major attack by Iran, it is highly unlikely that gradual increases in Iran's nuclear capability could prompt a military response that could effectively prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.
0079.00106; The American military could win a war that would effectively prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.
0079.00107; However, that would entail tens of thousands of dead Americans in a ground war.
0079.00108; As it would be so obvious that it was Trump's choice to withdraw from the 2015 Nuclear Agreement, that was the direct cause of that loss of life, the hatred of Trump by the families of the casualties of the unnecessary war, could force Trump to spend the rest of his life in hiding, probably outside of the United States. Those factors do not preclude some horrendous military conflict from still occurring, as Trump feels possibly boxed-in or some other event triggers such a war.
0079.00109; This probably is now the biggest risk for both investors and everyone else.
0079.00110; The table below shows the components of BDCL along with the price, weight, dividend, ex-dividend date and contribution to the third quarter BDCL and LBDC dividend, for each.
0079.00111; The dividends listed in the table are the sum of the dividends that will impact the quarterly dividend. Thus, for a monthly payer, the figure in the dividend column is the sum of the three monthly dividends with ex-dates in the third quarter.
0079.00112; Likewise, any special dividends with ex-dates in the third quarter are added to the regular dividends. In the frequency column, q denotes quarterly and those that pay monthly have an m.
0079.00113; From this data, I calculated a projection for the next quarterly dividend of BCDL of $0.5754.
0079.00114; There were some factors and changes that will impact the October 2019 dividend.
0079.00115; TPG Specialty Lending Inc (TSLX) maintained its quarterly dividend at $0.39, but increased its special third quarter dividend to $0.04 from $0.01 in the prior quarter. Hercules Technology Growth Capital Inc (HTGC) maintained its quarterly dividend at $0.32, but increased its special third quarter dividend to $0.02 from $0.01 in the prior quarter.
0079.00116; TCG BDC Inc (CGBD) maintained its quarterly dividend at $0.37, paid a special dividend in the second quarter of $0.08 and did not pay a special dividend in the 3rd quarter. Newtek Business Services Corp (NEWT) increased its quarterly dividend to $0.58 from $0.46.
0079.00117; Gladstone Investment Corp (GAIN) maintained its monthly dividend at $0.068, but decreased its special third quarter dividend to $0.03 from $0.09. BlackRock Kelso Capital Corp (BKCC) decreased its third quarter dividend to $0.14 from $0.18.
0079.00118; Capital Southwest Corp (CSWC) increased its quarterly dividend to $0.40 from $0.39, and paid special dividends of $0.10 in each quarter.
0079.00119; Saratoga Investment Corp (SAR) increased its third quarter dividend to $0.56 from $0.55.
0079.00120; Portman Ridge Finance Corp (PTMN) decreased its third quarter dividend to $0.06 from $0.10, and had paid a one-time special dividend of $0.669672 in the second quarter.
0079.00121; BDCL is more equity market sensitive than the other 2x Leveraged High-Yield ETNs.
0079.00122; The equity markets seemed to be trading off of every development in the trade and tariffs situation. Recently, fears of an economic slowdown or even a recession and related credit concerns seem to have become important.
0079.00123; All 2x leveraged high-yield ETNs have interest rate risk, since their dividends fluctuate inversely with the borrowing costs implicit in their leveraged structure. However, MORL and REML have relatively greater exposure to interest rates than BDCL and CEFL.
0079.00124; It is highly unlikely that any of the business development companies that comprise the index upon which BDCL is based would hold any longer-term obligations with fixed coupon rates.
0079.00125; The only debt securities that business development companies would normally hold in the course of their business, would be loans to the companies that the business development companies have invested in.
0079.00126; Those debt instruments would usually be convertible into equity and have adjustable interest rates.
0079.00127; Thus, they would tend not to be hurt by higher interest rates.
0079.00128; BDCL has the most idiosyncratic risk, since the business development companies that comprise the Wells Fargo Business Development Company index upon which the fund is based have specific risk factors that impact that sector.
0079.00129; Protectionism still poses various risks to the markets. Tariffs always increase prices, thus raising fears of inflation, which could increase interest rates or prevent the Federal Reserve from further cutting rates.
0079.00130; The Smoot-Hawley tariff demonstrated the damage protectionism can do to the world economy in the 1930s.
0079.00131; The protectionist tariffs are already causing damage. The trade situation with China seems to be volatile.
0079.00132; As the retaliating country China has, by far, the upper hand.
0079.00133; China has now announced that it is lowering tariffs on goods from all countries except the USA.
0079.00134; This will spare China's consumers and producers from some of the higher prices resulting from China's retaliatory tariffs against the USA.
0079.00135; American consumers and producers are getting no such relief. China is taking advantage of Trump picking trade fights with almost all of the world.
0079.00136; China will probably be able to strengthen trade ties with countries including: Canada, Australia, Japan and the EU, to a degree China could never have been able to accomplish until Trump.
0079.00137; The future direction of both the stock market and bond market could be categorized as a question of which macroeconomic factors are more powerful. The massive shift in the tax burden from the rich to the middle class, which was significantly exacerbated by the 2017 tax bill, will initially make much more funds available for investment.
0079.00138; However, this will also eventually result in over-investment.
0079.00139; This will result in another recession. The other macroeconomic question is what the impact of protectionism and tariffs will be. Tariffs raise prices and reduce economic activity.
0079.00140; The possible result could be stagflation if the Federal Reserve attempts to offset the inflationary impact of the tariffs by raising interest rates high enough to reduce economic activity.
0079.00141; This suggests diversification among securities that are more sensitive to equity markets and those more sensitive to bond markets. Since 2012, I have been willing to collect and reinvest the 15%+ yields on a monthly or quarterly compounded basis that 2X Leveraged ETNs pay, while the ultimate answers to questions about the outlook for the economy and securities markets are revealed.
0079.00142; I still am.
0079.00143; My base view is that there will likely be more reductions than increases in the Federal Funds rate during the next five years. Furthermore, the possibility exists that Trump's trade policies could precipitate a Lehman collapse like event.
0079.00144; In a scenario like that, 2X Leveraged mREIT ETNs would be one of the best places to be.
0079.00145; BDCL, CEFL, SMHD and SMHB might not do so well in a financial crisis when credit spreads could soar.
0079.00146; If you are reading this, you probably are an investor in, or at least a potential investor in 2X Leveraged ETNs such as MORL, MRRL, REML, CEFL, SMHD, SMHB, and BDCL.
0079.00147; In my article, BDCL: The Third Leg Of The High-Yielding Leveraged ETN Stool, I said that BDCL is correlated to the overall stock market and may be a very good diversifier for investors seeking high income who are now heavily invested in interest rate-sensitive instruments. I still tend to believe that the massive tax-policy-induced increase in inequality will cause increasing excesses of loanable and investable funds, above commercially reasonable ways to utilize those funds.
0079.00148; This will eventually result in an overinvestment cycle with a recession, and that will ultimately be very good for the 2X Leveraged ETNs.
0079.00149; However, there does exist some possibility that there may be some reversal of the shift in the tax burden away from the rich and onto the middle class as a result of the 2020 election.
0079.00150; Taking all of this into consideration, I'm still a cautious buyer of 2X Leveraged ETNs and have added to them recently.
0079.00151; When one of the UBS 2X Leveraged ETNs based on similar index as another can be bought lower than the other one, it would make sense to buy whichever was cheaper.
0079.00152; Until September 6, 2018, MRRL, REML and MORL traded very close to their net asset (indicative) values, as MRRL and REML still do. When MORL was trading at a large premium to net asset value, selling MORL and buying REML was a good move.
0079.00153; This was particularly relevant for those whose MORL was held at Fidelity, which allows new purchases of REML but only allows sales of MORL.
0079.00154; It might be noted that while Fidelity does not now allow new purchases of SMHD, it does, as of now, allow new purchases of SMHB.
0079.00155; While all 2X leveraged ETNs have some possibility of early redemption, the possibility is more remote for SMHB than for SMHD.
0079.00156; That is possibly why Fidelity allows new purchase of SMHB and not SMHD. If UBS were to stop selling new shares of BDCL, a large spread could emerge between BDCL and LBDC, similar to that of MORL over MRRL.
0079.00157; I am still a cautious buyer of BDCL, primarily as a high-yielding diversifier in my portfolio of other high-yielding 2X leveraged ETNs.
0079.00158; It is somewhat annoying that two of the components of BDCL do not currently pay any dividends and do not seem likely to do so anytime soon.
0079.00159; My projection of $0.5754 for the BDCL October 2019 BDCL dividend would be a annual rate of $2.3014.
0079.00160; That would be a 15.8% simple yield, with BDCL priced at $14.59 and an annualized quarterly compounded yield of 16.7%.
0079.00161; An investment of $100,000 would be worth $185,679 in five years.
0079.00162; More interestingly, for those investing for future income, the income from the initial $100,000 would increase from the $16,732 first-year annual rate to $31,070 annually.
0079.00163; I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).
0079.00164; I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

0081.00001; Wood-furniture technology in the second quarter Wednesday September 18th, 2019  Acimall has published the results of the quarterly analysis for the April-June 2019 period, which shows a consolidation of the well-known trends: the domestic market, after the fiscal doping of amortization and Industry 4.0 incentives, is back to normal levels, while we are waiting to see the impact of the Growth Act and the related measures for small and medium businesses.
0081.00002; Contraction is also visible in export, under the pressure of stagnating German economic and the ups-and-downs of economic relations between China and the United States. Figures speak for themselves. according to the periodical survey by the Studies office of Acimall  -  the Confindustria member association that represents our industry  -  the orders of wood and furniture machinery and equipment have decreased by 14.4 percent compared to the second quarter 2018.
0081.00003; As mentioned, foreign demand has decreased (down by 7.1 percent, versus minus 10.2 percent in the previous quarter), and domestic demand even worse (minus 36.3 percent, versus 14.5 percent down in January-March 2019).
0081.00004; The book of orders is at 2.8 months (it was 3.7 months at the end of March), while prices have been growing by 1.2 percent since the beginning of 2019.
0081.00005; In the first and, again, in the second quarter, however, revenues are increasing, up by 3.3 percent (but in the January-March 2019 period the increase rate was 10.3 percent). A stationary trend is also expected for employment according to 82 percent of the sample, while 6 percent expect an increase and 12 percent fear shrinkage.
0081.00006; Available stocks are stationary according to 65 percent, increasing according to 18 percent and falling according to the remaining 17 percent. The forecast survey confirms the recent climate of poor confidence due to the negative trend of German economy.
0081.00007; 18 percent of the interviewees still believe that foreign orders will bring good news (optimists were just 13 percent last quarter), while 53 percent expect a stationary trend (60 percent in January-March 2019) and 29 percent see decreasing orders ahead (versus 27 percent three months ago).
0081.00008; The balance is negative by 11 points. On the domestic market, optimists amount to 6 percent of the sample, very close to 7 percent in the previous quarter.
0081.00009; According to 65 percent, we will see substantial stability (60 percent three months ago), while 29 percent expect a reduction (versus 33 percent in January-March).
0081.00010; The balance is negative by 23 points.

0083.00001; Mumbai: Domestic equity benchmark BSE Sensex vaulted 1,921 points on Friday, fuelled by a slew of economy-boosting measures announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.
0083.00002; Logging its biggest intra-day spike in over a decade, the 30-share index soared 2,284.55 points to a peak of 38,378.02, before settling 1,921.15 points or 5.32 per cent higher at 38,014.62.
0083.00003; Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty zoomed 569.40 points or 5.32 per cent to end at 11,274.20.
0083.00004; Bulls took over the market after the government slashed corporate tax rates for companies by almost 10 percentage points to 25.17 per cent to bring them at par with Asian rivals such as China and South Korea.
0083.00005; The finance minister also said the government will not levy the enhanced surcharge introduced in the Budget on capital gains arising on sale of equity shares in a companies liable for securities transaction tax.

0085.00001; 72Shares  After the financial problems of the Great Depression, the federal government created the Federal Housing Authority and approved lenders to offer the FHA loan.
0085.00002; This single action by the government created one of the most popular types of mortgages that is still used today.
0085.00003; Listed below are guidelines and basic information about the Wisconsin FHA loan and how it helps potential home buyers. Low Down Payment  Probably the most attractive aspect of the Wisconsin FHA loan is the small down payment requirement.
0085.00004; While some loans may require between 5% and 20% of the home's selling price as an upfront payment, this is not the case with FHA.
0085.00005; Buyers are required to only pay 3.5% of the home's selling price as an upfront payment.
0085.00006; Furthermore, the money that is used for a down payment does not have to come directly from the borrower's pocket.
0085.00007; A family member or certain non-profit agencies can give the money to the borrower as a gift. Just be sure to check with your lender about the necessary documents for recording the gift to the buyer. Credit Rules  On the heels of the low down payment requirement, the credit guidelines are the 2nd most popular reason to use an FHA mortgage.
0085.00008; The credit rules for getting approved via FHA are much more relaxed when compared to conventional loans.
0085.00009; This is not to say that any credit score can qualify.
0085.00010; But it is safe to say that many people who may have made financial mistakes in the past will find a quality loan with FHA. Assistance from Sellers  Buying a home involves more than just the buyer, seller, and real estate agent.
0085.00011; There will be an appraisal of the home, research of the deed and title to the home, property taxes due to the local county agent, insurance on the home, along with a host of other items.
0085.00012; All of these services can add up to a hefty sum of money.
0085.00013; In order to help the buyer, FHA will let a seller of a home give 6% of the home's price to the buyer to be used for covering the closing costs.
0085.00014; This particular item must be negotiated between the seller and buyer, usually with assistance by real estate agents.
0085.00015; It is not required by FHA, merely a bonus. Wisconsin FHA Loan Limits  FHA does put restrictions on the amount of money that can be offered for a mortgage. Regardless of credit score or income, loans over the maximum level are not allowed.
0085.00016; For most counties across Wisconsin, the highest loan amount authorized by FHA is $314,827 for a single family home, as of January 2019. There are certain high-cost areas, like Kenosha County, where the maximum loan amount is higher.
0085.00017; Check with your local lender to find out the highest loans allowed in your area.
0085.00018; Documenting Income and Assets  In order to gain approval for a home loan under the Wisconsin FHA guidelines, all borrowers must have documented proof of their income and assets. For income purposes, all pay stubs from all jobs over the last 60 days, as well as W-2 forms for the past 2 calendar years will be sufficient.
0085.00019; For any borrower that is self-employed, personal tax returns, as well as business tax returns from the last 2 calendar years, will need to be provided.
0085.00020; Home buyers that intend to use their own money for the down payment and/or closing cost funds will need to give proof of the funds.
0085.00021; This can come in the form of bank statements for savings, checking or CD account or it can be a recent statement from your investment adviser that shows your balance in stocks, bonds or other accounts. Properties Allowed by FHA  FHA rules state that home buyers may purchase a single family home or a single condo unit with a Wisconsin FHA mortgage. Also, multi-family properties such as a duplex, triplex, or quadplex may also be purchased with FHA loans.
0085.00022; However, vacation properties nor investment homes can be purchased using FHA loans.
0085.00023; This is due to the restriction that an FHA borrower must intend to live in the home as their primary residence.
0085.00024; Income vs Debt Ratios and Rules  Lenders will examine a borrower's current debt obligations and compare that to their monthly income in order to calculate a ratio.
0085.00025; This is commonly referred to as a debt to income ratio.
0085.00026; The first part of the ratio compares a home buyer's current debt requirements to their monthly gross income. Real estate agents, as well as mortgage lenders, sometimes call this the front ratio or front end debt to income. As a rule of thumb, having a ratio of 28% or lower is ideal.
0085.00027; The second part of the ratio compares the home buyer's total monthly income to their current debt as well as the potential new mortgage loan payment. Lenders and real estate agents typically call this a back end ratio.
0085.00028; The rule of thumb for the back end ratio is 41%.
0085.00029; To illustrate, picture a husband and wife that have a combined gross income of $96,000 per year.
0085.00030; Divided by 12 equals $8,000 per month in gross income. If the couple has various payments to credit cards, auto lenders and student debt that totals $1,593 then their front end ratio would be  $1,593 / $8,000 = 0.19912 or 19.9%, which is well below the 28% mentioned above. If the couple are considering the purchase of a home with a monthly mortgage payment of $1,233 then their other ratio would look like this.
0085.00031; As mentioned, these are just rules of thumb.
0085.00032; Many borrowers get approved via FHA even though one of their ratios may be slightly higher than the ratio limits.
0085.00033; Different rules apply to specific credit situations that buyers may have faced in the past. The following list represents some of the most common credit hurdles and the corresponding FHA guidelines.
0085.00034; Child Support  All child support payments must be up to date in order to qualify for an FHA loan.
0085.00035; Student Loans  Student loans will be calculated as part of the debt to income ratios.
0085.00036; Currently, FHA will count 1% of the total of all outstanding student loans as a monthly debt obligation in order to calculate both the front end and back end debt to income ratios.
0085.00037; Bankruptcy  Any potential home buyer that has filed for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy can apply for an FHA loan after the discharge of the bankruptcy.
0085.00038; In fact, the payments that were made to the Bankruptcy Court can be used as qualifying credit. Potential buyers that previously filed a Chapter 7 plan will need to wait a minimum of 2 years after receiving their discharge from the bankruptcy court.
0085.00039; Tax Debt  A borrower that has outstanding taxes owed to the United States federal government is not allowed to get an FHA approval.
0085.00040; The taxes will need to be either paid off entirely or a suitable plan of repayment put in place before getting FHA approval.
0085.00041; Wisconsin FHA Rate and Term Refinance  People that have a current FHA loan, or another type of home loan, may choose to use an FHA rate & term refinance. The purpose of this type of refinance is to take advantage of either a better interest rate, or a better loan term, or both. For example, someone that has 20 years left on a mortgage and is currently paying 8% interest could choose to refinance to a 15-year fixed rate FHA loan with a much lower rate.
0085.00042; This would reduce the number of years to repay the loan and save interest. Or, someone may have 25 years left on a mortgage with 7.5% and may wish to take advantage of the currently low rates. The rate and term refinance do not allow borrowers to take out cash in the loan.
0085.00043; Wisconsin FHA Cash-Out Refinance  People that have either paid on their home loan for a while or are the beneficiaries of rising home value, may wish to tap into their home's equity. Getting a cash-out refinance loan pays off the existing mortgage and the extra funds are given to the borrower to use as they please.
0085.00044; The money can be used to pay off other debt, go on a vacation, do improvements to the home, buy a boat or basically any other reason.
0085.00045; Any qualifying borrower can apply for the FHA cash-out refinance, regardless of the type of their current mortgage loan. Wisconsin FHA Streamline Refinance  This last type of refinancing is only available to people who are currently making payments on an FHA mortgage. For borrowers that meet the loan criteria, a streamline FHA refinance can allow the borrower to get a better interest rate without the typical paperwork of a normal FHA loan.
0085.00046; Minimum guidelines are:  The Borrower is not allowed to have more than a single 30-day late payment within the last 12 months. Any Borrowers with 60 days late payment on the mortgage, or higher, is not allowed The borrower must state that they will continue to reside at the property as their primary home The borrower does not have to show proof of income An appraisal may be waived  Usually speaking, borrowers that have made steady payments on time will be approved for this loan. Although FHA does not approve true construction loans, there is a program that is very similar to a construction loan.
0085.00047; This program is called the FHA 203k loan and it is offered in 2 different ways.
0085.00048; Purchase Combined with Minor Improvements  FHA can approve buyers to get enough money that would cover the cost of purchasing a property as well as extra funds that are earmarked for either necessary repairs or modest improvements.
0085.00049; The maximum amount of funds to be used for either repairs or improvements is $35,000.
0085.00050; This particular loan is known as the FHA 203K Streamline mortgage.
0085.00051; Purchase and Full Blown Renovation  A standard version of the FHA 203K loan will allow buyers to get funds for both the purchase of the property and money designated for a complete renovation of the home. The only limit on this type of loan is determined by the borrower's debt to income ratio and the prevailing maximum FHA loan amount for the area.
0085.00052; This loan requires a licensed contractor to oversee the renovation work.
0085.00053; FHA will also inspect the home periodically during the renovation to make sure the work is progressing at a normal rate.
0085.00054; Both the streamline FHA 203k and standard FHA 203k loans allow the homeowner to have one loan, with one closing, and only one interest rate for all the money that is borrowed. Based on all of these attractive qualities, it is easy to see why so many people choose a Wisconsin FHA loan.
0085.00055; Whether it is to buy a home, refinance an existing mortgage or buy a fixer-upper, the variety of FHA loans makes it affordable to become a homeowner.

0087.00001; We want a vulnerable currency to stimulate manufacturing, exports by Angela T. Forrester/ September 25, 2019/ Currency/ No Comments/  Shortly after the authorities became sworn in August 2018, they agreed to a financial and financial reform programme. Since then, a great deal of these ambitious plans has been implemented and the effects were a sharp deterioration in living requirements and disposable incomes.
0087.00002; What has been already performed?
0087.00003; First, they needed to deal with the burgeoning fiscal deficit which had reached over 15% of the gross domestic product and 40% of the State budget.
0087.00004; They raised taxes and compelled all government ministries to live within their allotted sources in some months authorities become working on a cash basis and had a fiscal surplus. Then they delinked the new sorts of foreign money in use from the US dollar  -  successfully trying to flow far from the United States$ as a number one means of trade, despite the fact that this created a new problem  -  that of rate discovery  -  what was the whole lot really worth and in what forex?
0087.00005; The government then gave anyone the proper to open foreign money owed at their bank and keep any foreign money receipts in the debts of the one. At first, this became no longer depended on, however, these days  -  just six months later, those way of protecting foreign forex are ordinary. Then came the February financial declaration from the Reserve Bank.
0087.00006; In this declaration, the government announced that the conversion price of one:1 for forex retained with the aid of the Reserve Bank to be used in uploading necessities turned into being deserted and would in destiny be decided on a willing-supplier, willing-consumer basis.
0087.00007; In a futile attempt to restrain the movement of foreign money markets to a marketplace pushed fee, the Reserve Bank fixed an artificial peg of two, five:1 and tried to preserve the open market fee at that level.
0087.00008; As any pupil of economics may want to have informed the authorities, inside the absence of unlimited quantities of US bucks which the RBZ governor could supply to the markets at 2, five:1, they might by no means maintain the charge at that stage if basics dictated in any other case.
0087.00009; In two weeks, the bank changed into pressured to allow a day by day shift and the interbank price fell to a few:1.
0087.00010; Then every other try and keep the charge at that level and the marketplace fees to four,6:1.
0087.00011; Everyone desires to apprehend where this case places those who simply generate foreign exchange  -  the miners, farmers, industrialists, and tourism operators.
0087.00012; Then there are the hobbies of these dwelling in the diaspora who send domestic about US$10 million an afternoon to assist their families and to pay for things like medical offerings and schooling.
0087.00013; So, when the Reserve Bank attempts, in violation of the Monetary Policy Statement in February and, consequently, unlawfully, to maintain the charge at a degree below what's perceived as the actual charge, then the ones keeping foreign money balances will shift their income of such foreign money to the casual market.
0087.00014; So, during the last month, I doubt if US$100 million has been traded at the formal interbank marketplace.
0087.00015; The impact of such activity is the opposite of what the Reserve Bank become looking to reap.
0087.00016; Price discovery is accepted as being the price in casual markets and this then sets the rate at which nearby costs are determined.
0087.00017; In many institutions, expenses are listed in US dollars and the business enterprise then uses a charge  -  4:1 to determine what we pay in ZWL$ or in bond notes.
0087.00018; This has the effect of riding inflation costs even better.
0087.00019; One very unexpected development is that the awful lot despised 'bond notes' issued as a surrogate neighborhood paper foreign money is definitely trading at much stronger stages that the ZWL$.
0087.00020; But the situation is clearly worse than that due to the fact-exchange margins inside the informal zone are tons better than those levied on any formal markets and between banks.
0087.00021; Margins of five% to ten% on man or woman transactions are pronounced.
0087.00022; This method investors working within the informal market are making massive profits and are reluctant to allow the trade to transport into the formal market.
0087.00023; In this, they're in reality supported by using the banks themselves.
0087.00024; My very own view is that if the Reserve Bank had allowed full implementation of the financial coverage, this will have speedy resulted within the formal interbank market handling the bulk of the trades in forex in an obvious way.
0087.00025; Sales margins would decline to 1,5% or less and the industrial banks would be bolstered. Under such circumstances, I am also pretty certain that marketplace charges would fortify to three:1 or even much less. This would lessen market prices as quickly as this turned into regarded as the actual market rate.
0087.00026; It would additionally permit anyone who wished forex to buy what they wanted available on the market through their banks.
0087.00027; The conversion rates used by absolutely everyone for price discovery could decline to 3:1 or much less precisely wherein the RBZ wants costs to stabilize.
0087.00028; My own view is that we need susceptible forex to stimulate the effective quarter and enhance export pastime.

0087.00030; This might permit the RBZ to accumulate their foreign reserves, something we are going to must do for debt clearance within the long-term.
0087.00031; But what we are not facing up to is the need to mitigate the effect of those huge swings in coverage on normal consumers. Since the programme was initiated, inflation has been at hyperinflation ranges for months, and prices have doubled or trebled at the same time as earning have stagnated.
0087.00032; In the previous dispensation, our export industries were being used to subsidize the expenses of critical customer objects consisting of gas, maize meal, cooking oil and bread.
0087.00033; This was crippling our exporters and boosting intake of imported necessities and for that reason riding up the import bill.
0087.00034; It could not have been allowed to carry on or we of a might be completely crippled.

0088.00001; Federal Heat On Low-Profile, Long-Serving Aide To Chicago Ald. Austin Claudia Morell, Dan Mihalopoulos  Claudia Morell/WBEZ  Chester Wilson Jr., longtime chief of staff to Ald. Carrie Austin, 34th Ward, leaves City Hall on a recent afternoon.
0088.00002; Updated: 6:18 p.m.
0088.00003; Carrie Austin, a position that pays a six-figure salary and often brings him into close contact with many of the most important people in the city's Democratic politics. In addition to his job as Austin's chief of staff, Wilson also became something of a player in his own right  -  in real estate on the far South Side. At one time, he listed ownership of nine properties in or near Austin's 34th Ward.
0088.00004; But Wilson fell far behind on his property taxes for some of his buildings. He came to owe tens of thousands of dollars in taxes, interest and fees for just one dilapidated building at the corner of 103rd Street and Corliss Avenue, having skipped property-tax payments for every year from 2008 through 2013.
0088.00005; Then a businessman named Boris Nitchoff stepped up and bought the unpaid taxes for a few hundred dollars at Cook County's scavenger tax sale in 2016. That gave Wilson three years to pay his tax debt, or he could have lost the building to Nitchoff. Instead, Wilson was able to hand the building over to a county agency, in a move that wiped clean more than $150,000 in unpaid taxes for the property, according to documents obtained by WBEZ.

0088.00009; Please check your email for a welcome confirmation. Now, both Wilson and Nitchoff have drawn the attention of the federal authorities who raided Austin's ward office three months ago.
0088.00010; A grand jury subpoena in the ongoing, wide-ranging probe shows investigators wanted to see all items related to not only Austin but also Wilson, Nitchoff, three Nitchoff relatives and five Nitchoff family companies.
0088.00011; Nobody has been charged with a crime, and Austin has denied any wrongdoing, continuing her 25-year tenure as one of the most influential African American members of the City Council.
0088.00012; Nor is it known what suspicions drove FBI agents to get the search warrant used to raid Austin's office on 111th Street on June 19, when they dramatically hauled away boxes of documents and computers in the middle of a weekday. At City Hall recently, Wilson declined to comment on either the investigation or his problems with the property on Corliss, saying, You know I can't answer that. Austin did not respond to messages seeking comment, and neither did Boris Nitchoff.
0088.00013; But a WBEZ investigation found the connection between Wilson's private property dealings and Nitchoff, whose family's company has been among the top contractors in Austin's ward for many years.
0088.00014; And public records also detail how Wilson, 53, steadily and quietly rose from criminal convict who could not get hired as a cop to one of the highest-paid aides in the Chicago City Council.
0088.00015; Perfect place for Chester Known to many at City Hall as a quiet but influential behind-the-scenes figure, Wilson was called upon to lead orientation sessions for the chiefs of staff of other, newly elected aldermen. A lifelong South Sider, Wilson graduated from Corliss High School in 1984 and was working as a security guard at the Wrigley Building and the Chicago Sun-Times building in his early 20s, according to state Prisoner Review Board documents. He dreamed of becoming a Cook County sheriff's deputy, even taking the hiring exam.
0088.00016; But a one-time mistake would derail his dream of joining law enforcement, his lawyer wrote in Wilson's successful petition for executive clemency in 2013. That mistake? A guilty plea in Cook County court in 1993 to a felony count for allegedly helping cover up the theft of a car.
0088.00017; According to his clemency petition, Wilson agreed to keep a car at his home at the request of his cousin.
0088.00018; The car had been reported stolen, and Wilson put different license plates on the car.
0088.00019; Wilson later argued that he did not know the car was stolen and had changed the plates to keep his landlord from reporting an unknown vehicle on his property.
0088.00020; Concerned that he would lose his job if he kept missing days from work, Chester simply agreed to plead guilty to (one count) to put an end to the case, his lawyer wrote in the clemency petition. He was sentenced to 18 months probation, and the conviction frustrated Wilson's plans of becoming a sheriff's deputy. So he took another path that would prove fruitful.
0088.00021; He started volunteering with the office of 34th Ward Ald. Carrie M. Austin, his lawyer wrote.
0088.00022; Recognizing his dedicated spirit, they soon hired him as a part-time employee.
0088.00023; Wilson became a full-time city worker in 1995 and was promoted to chief of staff within a few years. It turned out that politics was the perfect place for Chester, his lawyer wrote.
0088.00024; The petition included photos of Wilson with former Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, former Illinois Senate President Emil Jones (D-Chicago), Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White and Austin.
0088.00025; Austin effusively praised Wilson in a character letter to Quinn, referring to him as her first line of defense ensuring my safe insulations when dealing with the general public.
0088.00026; The alderman also spoke on Wilson's behalf before the Prisoner Review Board. I can substantially attest to Chester Wilson's rehabilitation, Austin wrote to the governor.
0088.00027; Mr. Wilson's position allows him direct interaction with many elected officials, dignitaries, business and community leadership, and constituents.
0088.00028; Wilson was Austin's top aide during her 12 years in charge of the City Council's important Budget Committee, which approves the city government's annual, multi-billion dollar spending plans.
0088.00029; Austin lost that coveted spot after Lori Lightfoot became mayor earlier this year. Lightfoot gave Austin a consolation prize, appointing the veteran alderman to lead the new Committee on Contract Oversight.
0088.00030; Wilson moved with Austin to the new committee three months ago, for an annual salary of a little more than $118,000, records in his city personnel file show.
0088.00031; But the Lightfoot administration blacked-out a section titled references in Wilson's application for the new committee job.
0088.00032; City officials argue that releasing his references would be an unwarranted violation of the personal privacy of those individuals. WBEZ has filed a pending lawsuit against the city seeking the deleted parts of Wilson's personnel file, alleging violations of the state's open-records law. Prudent financial manager Besides the support of Democratic politicians, Wilson benefited from another letter for his clemency case from John Powen, a lawyer and real-estate developer from Deerfield.
0088.00033; Powen's company built a new house that Austin bought last year.
0088.00034; Federal investigators had sought documents relating to the construction and sale of the house.
0088.00035; Powen did not return messages seeking comment for this story.
0088.00036; Wilson also boasted in his clemency petition of success in the real estate field: As a prudent financial manager, Chester now owns several properties.
0088.00037; The petition included copies of some property-tax bills that Wilson had paid. What his lawyer did not describe, though, was how Wilson often struggled with keeping up with the property taxes for some of his other buildings.
0088.00038; The city of Chicago also cited Wilson repeatedly for code violations, including locking out tenants, letting dumpsters overflow and doing construction without permits. One of the longest and most complicated sagas involved Wilson's two-story brick building at 10300-02 S. Corliss Ave.
0088.00039; Wilson had paid $200,000 for the property in 2005, taking out a mortgage.
0088.00040; But he filed for bankruptcy protection, listing that mortgage among his debts, in 2010.
0088.00041; He also got out of paying the property taxes there.
0088.00042; A company called B. Hartman Group LLC bought the taxes for the Corliss building for $500, the minimum bid, at the county's scavenger sale.
0088.00043; The owner of B. Hartman Group is Boris Nitchoff, records show. Still, Wilson had to pay the back taxes, plus interest and fees, to Nitchoff within three years, or Nitchoff could have taken the property. But Nitchoff would never acquire the building, which included ground-floor retail space and second-story apartments.
0088.00044; Nitchoff's move instead gave Wilson time to come up with a different solution to his problem on Corliss Avenue. A donation wipes away tax debt This path involved the Cook County Land Bank Authority.
0088.00045; The county created the agency and gave it the power to take tax-delinquent properties and give them to new owners, who are supposed to improve them and put the land back on the tax rolls.
0088.00046; As Austin's chief of staff, Wilson had frequent contact with the land bank, according to emails obtained by WBEZ, about a variety of properties. Much of the land bank's work is done in the 34th Ward, which includes parts of West Pullman, Roseland and other economically challenged neighborhoods on the far South Side. In the case of the Corliss property, Wilson offered a donation of his own building to the land bank, according to one email from an official of the land bank to Wilson in 2017.
0088.00047; The land bank's acquisition of the building from Wilson wiped out the property's huge and growing tax debt. By that point, the back taxes, interest and fees on the Corliss building topped $150,000, according to WBEZ's analysis of county records.
0088.00048; Wilson not only gave the land bank the property  -  he also identified a potential buyer.
0088.00049; In an email from his official city account, Wilson told an official with the bank that it could sell his building to Lisa Livingston.
0088.00050; She's the owner of a day care center in the south suburbs.
0088.00051; And records show Wilson had done business with Livingston before the Corliss deal with the land bank.
0088.00052; Wilson and Livingston bought a house together in the 9700 block of South Emerald Avenue in 2016, and the rehabbed house was flipped for a tidy profit the following year.
0088.00053; Powen, the developer who built Austin's house, notarized documents related to the Emerald deal, according to public records. In May 2018, two months after Wilson gave the building on Corliss to the land bank, the county sold it to Livingston for $20,000.
0088.00054; The land bank's executive director, Robert Rose, did not return calls seeking comment.
0088.00055; But in a statement sent to WBEZ after publication of this story, Rose said the land bank does not allow deals if there is a prior relationship or affiliation between the previous owner of the property and the prospective buyer.
0088.00056; In the event that fraud is detected, the Cook County Land Bank Authority can reclaim the property, and any back taxes that were extinguished may be reinstated as due payable from the original owner, Rose said.
0088.00057; Livingston said she has a business relationship with Wilson but was unaware that Wilson previously owned the building on Corliss  -  or that Wilson recommended her to the land bank  -  until a reporter told her that this week.
0088.00058; The land bank gave Livingston a year to fix up the building.
0088.00059; But on a recent visit, it remained boarded-up and in obvious disrepair.
0088.00060; In February, the city sued Livingston in Cook County Circuit Court because, officials said, they wanted to fix dangerous and unsafe conditions at the property on Corliss.
0088.00061; But land bank officials granted Livingston's request for an extension until December to wrap up the repair work on the building.

0091.00006; Center for Public Integrity  -  Dave Levinthal | Published: 9/11/2019  The FEC no longer has enough members to conduct high-level business. The U.S. Senate and President Trump could easily appoint new commissioners and soon end the agency's involuntary trip through limbo.

0091.00016; The information is published on the FEC's website. Some transparency advocates worry the increasing attacks on donors could spark a backlash against the disclosure of information.
0091.00017; They fear the attacks will discourage voters from giving or steer them into contributing to political nonprofit groups that are not required to disclose their donors.
0091.00018; Admirers and activists praised her stand, but few noted the fact that she had built a financial cushion by pocketing big checks the years before.
0091.00019; The open secret of Warren's campaign is that her big-money fundraising through 2018 helped lay the foundation for her anti-big-money run for the presidency. Last winter and spring, she transferred $10.4 million in leftover funds from her 2018 Senate campaign to underwrite her 2020 run, a portion of which was raised from the same donor class she is now running against.
0091.00020; As Warren has risen in the polls on her populist and anti-corruption message, some donors and, privately, opponents are chafing at her campaign's purity claims of being 100 percent grassroots funded.
0091.00021; Under the proposed rules, certain tax-exempt groups  -  including groups such as the National Rifle Association, as well as labor unions and business leagues  -  would no longer be required to provide the names and addresses of major donors on annual tax forms.
0091.00022; Mayors Are Harassed and Threatened, But Just How Often? Governing  -  Mike Maciag | Published: 9/1/2019  Demeaning comments, harassment and, less commonly, threats of violence all come with the job of being a mayor. A new national survey assesses how frequently mayors experience various forms of abuse.
0091.00023; The survey, the basis of a study published in the journal State and Local Government Review, finds most mayors contend with verbal hostility or physical intimidation at rates above those of the general workforce.
0091.00024; Disrespectful comments or images on social media were by far the most frequent means of abuse.
0091.00025; More serious acts of violence were far less common.
0091.00026; About 11 percent of mayors reported property damage. Primary challenges to incumbents are rarely successful, and Trump's poll numbers among Republican voters have proved resilient.
0091.00027; The difference between just a handful of local elections across the country could mean a long-term shift in partisan control of Congress. If one party makes big gains in state Legislatures, they would have the power to use the decennial reapportionment and redistricting process to substantially alter the partisan makeup of Congress.
0091.00028; The high stakes in states across the country are reminiscent of the 2010 election, which became a Republican wave that swept the GOP to power and handed them control of the redistricting process.
0091.00029; As more House members and senators consider making their escape from Capitol Hill, the realities of the K Street economy and the revolving door will be among their considerations, say insiders at lobbying firms and headhunters.
0091.00030; Those who make hiring decisions on K Street say ex-lawmakers can sometimes struggle in the lobbying sector where they no longer receive the trappings that come with elective office, such as a team of staff members.
0091.00031; Many former members also balk, at least initially, at the idea of registering as a federal lobbyist or foreign agent, setting out limitations that firms find increasingly frustrating.
0091.00032; In most cases, it is the congressional staff members that K Street really clamors for.
0091.00033; He said he was not involved in any decision to put an Air Force flight crew at the resort, known as Trump Turnberry.
0091.00034; But documents obtained from Scottish government agencies show the Trump Organization, and Trump himself, played a direct role in setting up an arrangement between the Turnberry resort and officials at Glasgow Prestwick Airport. The government records show the Trump organization, starting in 2014, entered a partnership with the airport to try to increase private and commercial air traffic to the region.
0091.00035; From the States and Municipalities  Arizona  -  Some Push for Scottsdale to End Prayer at Council Meetings Amid Legal Showdown with Satanists  Arizona Republic  -  Lorraine Lonhi | Published: 9/10/2019  A Scottsdale resident and activists petitioned a city commission to recommend replacing invocations with moments of silence at city council meetings.
0091.00036; The move comes as Scottsdale and Satanists are locked in a legal battle over the city's decision three years ago to block Satanists from leading a council meeting invocation.
0091.00037; The Satanic Temple, an international Satanist group, has been asking city councils across the country to lead their invocations for several years. Some cities, such as Pensacola, Florida, allowed Satanists to give the invocations, but faced public backlash.
0091.00038; Scottsdale resident Sandy Schenkat said she has asked the Human Relations Commission three times this year to recommend that council adopt a moment of silence in place of invocations, but her requests have gone ignored.
0091.00039; More than four years have passed since agents from the FBI, IRS, and the Riverside County district attorney's office raided Palm Springs City Hall.
0091.00040; In bringing charges against the three men in 2017, the district attorney alleged Pougnet accepted bribes in exchange for city council votes and contracts in favor of their projects. The three have previously pleaded not guilty.
0091.00041; If found guilty, Pougnet could be sentenced to as much as 19 years in prison, while the developers, if convicted, could face up to 12 years in prison each.
0091.00042; A memo to Lara said the meeting had a specific purpose: Relationship Building to benefit Ricardo Lara for Insurance Commissioner 2022.
0091.00043; He pledged not to take money from the insurance industry as he ran for the post but broke his promise this year by accepting more than $50,000 from insurance representatives and their spouses.
0091.00044; Some of the money came from donors who ties to one of the companies scheduled to be represented at the lunch.
0091.00045; Social media posts show Lara also counts insurance lobbyists among his friends.
0091.00046; He partied with a Farmers Insurance lobbyist on New Year's Eve a week before his inauguration.
0091.00047; Lara is already under scrutiny for his campaign fundraising and perceived coziness with the insurance industry.
0091.00048; Lara spokesperson Michael Soller said Department of Insurance legal counsel concluded Lara's rental expenses comply with state law because he only bills taxpayers for days spent in Sacramento.
0091.00049; Soller declined to provide the legal memo or the name of the lawyer.
0091.00050; Colorado  -  Chief Storytellers: Community engagement or PR?
0091.00051; Governing  -  Graham Vyse | Published: 8/29/2019  It looked like a conventional public meeting as a city employee in Denver stood before half a dozen people in a community center.
0091.00052; Yet this was not a typical community forum, and Rowena Alegría was not a typical city employee.
0091.00053; I am the chief storyteller for the city and county of Denver, she told the group, and she had come for one of her regular storytelling labs.
0091.00054; They are a chance for residents to record personal stories about their city, using text, audio, and video to help local government preserve community history.
0091.00055; Denver's alternative paper Westword called into question how the chief storyteller just happens to be a former Mayor Michael] Hancock aide, raising concerns that she was running a taxpayer-funded office designed to polish PR for Denver. But Alegría is quick to say her storytelling is community engagement, not PR.
0091.00056; Andrea Lombard was an epidemiologist in the hepatitis C program at DPH. In the summer of 2018, DPH was looking to fill administrative assistant positions in the program and hired an outside vendor to help with process.
0091.00057; Lombard's daughter became a candidate for one of those positions and she personally selected her daughter to fill one of the positions.
0091.00058; While her daughter was employed, Lombard directly supervised her, including assigning and evaluating her work, approving her timecards, and approving overtime.
0091.00059; Florida law and Senate rules do not ban such relationships.
0091.00060; A senator cannot vote on any matter that the officer knows would inure to his or her special private gain or loss.
0091.00061; Senate rules require disclosure of a conflict if the special private gain or loss applies to an immediate family member or business associate.
0091.00062; The most recent loan in 2017, for $200,000, was given to Hammer, who earns $110,000-a-year as the group's executive director, so she could refinance and purchase real estate, according to Unified Sportsmen's regulatory filings.
0091.00063; Florida law prohibits not-for-profit corporations like Unified Sportsmen from loaning money to their directors or officers.
0091.00064; And while Unified Sportsmen solicits contributions from the public, the state Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services has not made it register, disclose certain information, or pay fees as the law requires of nonprofits.
0091.00065; Veteran anti-patronage attorney Michael Shakman said in a new legal filing that Yarbrough has put the politically connected into jobs that are supposed to be free from such influence, asked her employees for campaign contributions on their private cellphones and transferred certain supervisors to far-flung offices in hopes they would quit.
0091.00066; Yarbrough, who was under federal court oversight in her previous job as recorder of deeds, called Shakman's latest allegations preposterous.
0091.00067; Candidates say bringing their families along helps them spend more time with them during their grueling campaign schedules.
0091.00068; It also gives Iowans a more up-close look at the candidates' personal lives, which can make them more relatable in a process that puts a high value on person-to-person interaction.
0091.00069; Even when their kids are not around, the children of candidates make frequent appearances in their speeches, with candidates sharing the impact they have made on their policies like health care and childcare.
0091.00070; Matt Bevin wants the Kentucky Supreme Court to remove Franklin Circuit Court Judge Phillip Shepherd from hearing the teacher sickout lawsuit, saying he is too biased to preside over the case.
0091.00071; The governor's legal team says the integrity of the state's judicial branch is on the line and requests Chief Justice John Minton appoint a special judge.
0091.00072; The Bevin administration points to an August Facebook post Shepherd liked that praises campaign volunteers for Andy Beshear, who is running against Bevin in the fall election.
0091.00073; Bevin used Twitter to slam Shepherd for his blatant partisan support for Democrats. Shepherd declined to remove himself from the case, saying he had liked posts from Republicans and was supporting the political process in general.
0091.00074; Correia brazenly accepted cash bribes in exchange for issuing official letters needed to obtain a license to set up a pot business, authorities alleged. They said at least four business owners paid a total of $600,000 in bribes to the mayor, and he used the money to support a lavish lifestyle and cover mounting legal bills.
0091.00075; Correia was already facing charges on accusations he stole investor funds.
0091.00076; He has pleaded not guilty.
0091.00077; The latest investigation, which also involved agents from the FBI and IRS, highlighted the potential for abuse in Massachusetts' nascent retail marijuana industry, authorities said.
0091.00078; Jamie Long announced he is resigning from a paid fellowship at the University of Minnesota after Republicans raised questions about preferential treatment in filling the post. Long accepted a seven-month research fellowship at the Institute on the Environment's Energy Transition Lab in July.
0091.00079; The $50,000 temporary role was set to end just after the Legislature returns to work in February.
0091.00080; In a statement announcing his resignation, Long, an attorney, said he was honored to accept the job after a competitive public hiring process.
0091.00081; He cited his long history of working on environmental and climate issues.
0091.00082; But e-mails and internal documents show Long and Ellen Anderson, a former state senator now at the helm of the Energy Transition Lab, discussed creating the position months before it was publicly posted.
0091.00083; So far this year, a quarter of every dollar raised to elect Parson governor in 2020 is connected to Tilley. A large part of that money has come from lobbying clients engaged in industries regulated by the state agencies Parson oversees, ranging from gaming to medical marijuana to low-income housing tax credits. Before Parson took over as governor in June 2018, Tilley had 25 lobbying clients.
0091.00084; In the year since Parson took the oath of office, that number has ballooned to more than 70. Miller had pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting bribery.
0091.00085; The prosecution's sentencing memo outlines several instances in which Miller used his clout as chief of staff to bully and threaten lower-level employees into doing Stenger's bidding.
0091.00086; By contrast, Miller's attorney, Larry Hale, portrayed Miller as someone who was simply following the orders of Stenger, a vindictive person known to threaten to terminate or otherwise punish those who did not follow his directives. The judges said Montana's law is a violation of the First Amendment's free-speech protections.
0091.00087; The court has previously upheld other state laws that regulate robocalls, such as those that aim to protect consumers from scams, but those laws were based on how robocalls are made and not on what they say, the judges said.
0091.00088; You will find the word 'telegraph' in the current code as far as what lobbyists should be reporting, telephone and telegraph expenses you won't find the word 'internet' in there, Mangan said. Lawmakers on the State Administration and Veterans' Affairs Committee voiced concern about the cost of administering new lobbying regulations but voted to study the issue and potentially draft bills for consideration in the 2021 Legislature.
0091.00089; The ACLU said the law violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments and called for an order to restrain the state from enforcing the act. The law requires independent expenditure commissioners to publicly disclose donors contributing more than $10,000 to the organization and bar any person who chairs a political party committee or a legislative leadership committee from serving as that committee's chairperson or treasurer.
0091.00090; The ACLU argued it would fall under the restrictions, and said because it often works on controversial issues of public interest, many of its donors avail themselves of anonymity.
0091.00091; New York  -  Alleged Rape Victim's Case Shakes Up JCOPE  Albany Times Union  -  Chris Bragg | Published: 9/10/2019  The normally staid monthly meeting of the New York Joint Commission on Public Ethics (JCOPE) featured a first: two women dressed in red cloaks and white wimples stationed outside the agency's offices, reading a satiric children's book detailing the panel's alleged failings.
0091.00092; The protest, with costumes inspired by the novel The Handmaid's Tale, was organized by Kat Sullivan, an alleged rape survivor who has been targeted for possible lobbying violations while advocating for passage of the Child Victim's Act.
0091.00093; Sullivan took out ads on billboards criticizing the state's molestation laws. JCOPE determined the billboards amounted to lobbying and threatened Sullivan with fines if she refused to pay the registration fee.
0091.00094; Sullivan's attorney went before JCOPE to demand that it drop the case against Sullivan since she did not spend enough on the billboards to qualify as a lobbyist under state law.
0091.00095; SAM-NY contended it should be exempt from the state's semi-annual disclosure because its supporters would be subject to harassment and economic reprisal if they were identified.
0091.00096; New York law has a blanket disclosure exemption for charitable organizations engaged in lobbying, including the pro-legalization Drug Policy Alliance.
0091.00097; JCOPE has denied disclosure exemption requests in the past from the New York Civil Liberties Union, New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms, and Family Planning Advocates of New York, only to have those decisions overturned by a judicial hearing officer, who described the rulings as clearly erroneous.
0091.00098; Bishop defeated Dan McCready, a moderate Democrat, by two percentage points in a district Trump carried by nearly 12 points in 2016.
0091.00099; The fight for the Ninth Congressional District also brought to an end a tortured political drama: The 2018 midterm race for the seat, in which McCready barely lost against a different Republican, was in question for months because of evidence of election fraud on the GOP side.
0091.00100; The election was finally thrown out, an embarrassing conclusion for state Republicans who had carved the lines of the deeply red district.
0091.00101; Roy Cooper's veto of the state budget, sparking chaos in the chamber by bypassing Democratic lawmakers. Democrats said they did not expect a voting session that morning.
0091.00102; Only 12 Democrats were present, and only nine voted, with several not even at their seats, party leader said.
0091.00103; Cooper accused Republicans of pulling their most deceptive stunt yet at a time when many North Carolinians were focused on honoring those killed in the September 11 attacks, though it was not clear how many lawmakers may have been attending memorials.
0091.00104; The override is not complete as the Senate still must hold a vote on the issue, but Republicans there need only one Democrat to join them to secure victory.
0091.00105; Other state ethics have taken up little to no business in recent years.
0091.00106; State lawmakers have an ethics committee, but there is no indication it has ever met.
0091.00107; The new five-member commission is tasked with investigating ethics complaints against elected state officials, candidates for office, and lobbyists, and is expected to write its own administrative rules.
0091.00108; Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner said the lack of ethics meetings and complaints indicates nothing has risen to the level of a perceived violation.
0091.00109; I think overall most legislators pull a pretty fine line and stay away from stuff like that, and so I appreciate that as leader, Wardner said. Oregon  -  Campaign Money Limits in 2020?
0091.00110; Oregon Supreme Court Leaves Possibility Open  Portland Oregonian  -  Rob Davis | Published: 9/5/2019  The Oregon Supreme Court rejected a request to delay arguments in a major campaign finance case, a decision that leaves open the possibility that political donations could be capped in statewide races next year, even though lawmakers have stumbled in their own attempts to set them.
0091.00111; Business groups wanted the court to postpone hearing a case to decide the legality of limits adopted by Multnomah County voters in 2016.
0091.00112; The groups argued it was inappropriate for the court to rule on limits with voters set to do the same thing next November.
0091.00113; Supporters of limits characterized the request as an attempt to allow unlimited contributions to dominate another election cycle.
0091.00114; Chief Justice Martha Walters denied the industry groups' request without specifying why.
0091.00115; Kate Brown privately worked against a pro-transparency bill that ultimately failed in June, according to records released by Oregon's public records advocate in the wake of her resignation. Brown has pledged to increase transparency under her watch since she was sworn in as governor in 2015.
0091.00116; Yet memos and emails show staffers and lobbyists working on her behalf opposed a proposal to make state agencies track and disclose information about records requests they receive from the public. The documents say Brown's staffers told public records advocate Ginger McCall her work to support the bill contradicted the governor's interests and was a bad idea.
0091.00117; Then, by action or inaction, Brown's office got in the way of the bill's progress while publicly maintaining its support for transparency and the concept of government accountability. Chaka Fattah was overturned, former Philadelphia Deputy Mayor Herbert Vederman made a deal with the Justice Department that would send him to prison for only one year  -  half of what he originally had received  -  instead of risking a second trial.
0091.00118; But U.S. District Court Judge Harvey Bartle III had other ideas.
0091.00119; Calling the agreement far too lenient and not just, the judge rejected the proposal and ordered Vederman, whom prosecutors once described as Fattah's human ATM machine, to spend two years in prison.
0091.00120; The turn of events capped what already had been an unusual proceeding that brought into the open rarely seen discord between Justice Department officials in Washington, D.C. and their local counterparts.
0091.00121; Rhode Island  -  Rhode Island House Employee Has Sexual Assault Conviction, Records Show  Boston Globe  -  Edward Fitzpatrick | Published: 9/9/2019  A former police sergeant who was convicted of committing sexual assault while in uniform in the 1980s has been employed by the Rhode Island Legislature for more than a decade.
0091.00122; Michael Burke, a former North Kingstown police officer who served prison time on two counts of first-degree sexual assault, has worked as manager of House operations since 2007 but is now out on workers' compensation.
0091.00123; The House speaker when Burke was hired, William Murphy, said Burke was recommended to him by a former state representative, whom he declined to identify, and he interviewed Burke.
0091.00124; I gave him a second chance, Murphy said. When I was speaker, he always comported himself as a gentleman in the statehouse.
0091.00125; I never received any complaint about him. … I am glad I gave Mr. Burke a second chance.
0091.00126; Andrew Farmer changed billboards for his personal business over concerns from residents he was using his elected office to benefit his law firm.
0091.00127; Farmer has several billboards in East Tennessee for his law firm, which provides criminal defense and personal injury services.
0091.00128; One of the billboards read, Who better to argue the law than an actual lawmaker? Paying for the billboards for his personal business out of campaign money would be illegal.
0091.00129; Farmer said he does not use his position as a lawmaker to help attract more clients or influence the outcome of cases. The Registry of Election Finance approved a plan to start talks with the secretary of state's office about updating its website, which provides the public and the media a view into the activities of candidates.
0091.00130; After discovering the Bureau of Ethics and Campaign Finance had more than $1 million available in reserves, registry board member Tom Lawless suggested an update to the state's website is necessary.
0091.00131; Registry Auditor Jay Moeck said he is currently unable to fulfill 18 outstanding audits before the end of the year.
0091.00132; He was tasked with coming up with hiring recommendations prior to the panel's November meeting.
0091.00133; Royce West raked in millions of dollars in legal fees representing governmental entities such as the Dallas and Houston independent school districts, metropolitan transportation agencies, and major Texas cities, sparking criticism he is using his influence as a state lawmaker to score business deals average citizens cannot get.
0091.00134; Until now, it was nearly impossible for voters to quantify the number of governmental contracting deals or estimate how much he has been personally making from his private business interests.
0091.00135; But because West running for the U.S. Senate, which requires more robust disclosure than Texas, he is finally pulling back the curtain on his considerable wealth. Two […]  Missouri lawmakers are back in Jefferson City for the annual veto session, beginning September 11 at 12 p.m. at the Missouri State Capitol.
0091.00136; Two widely debated vetoes include outdoor cremations and whether to let motorcyclists ride without a helmet.
0091.00137; A two-thirds vote in the House and the Senate is needed to overturn a veto. Tim Moore resigned his seat midterm, citing his own belief in term limits.
0091.00138; The special election will be held on the same date as the statewide general election.
0091.00139; Committees must now timely file disclosures of financing for certain election communications advocating for or against a city candidate.
0091.00140; Additionally, committees […]  The Portland Auditor has announced new campaign finance disclosure and contribution requirements and a new public campaign financing program.
0091.00141; Committees must now timely file disclosures of financing for certain election communications advocating for or against a city candidate. Additionally, committees must provide names of individuals or other entities contributing to the committees.
0091.00142; Entities making more than $750 in independent expenditures to support or oppose city candidates must now register with the secretary of state as a political committee or independent expenditure filer and provide certain disclosures.
0091.00143; Public and private employers must now allow employees to donate to political committees through payroll deduction if they allow similar post-tax deductions for other purposes.
0091.00144; The public campaign financing program will require candidates to agree to limit individual contributions to $250 or less and abide by other fundraising limits.
0091.00145; Qualified candidates will receive a six to one match for campaign contributions of $50 or less.
0091.00146; Candidates will not be required to participate in the program.
0091.00147; The new disclosure rules went into effect Wednesday, September 4.
0091.00148; City candidates are eligible to qualify for the public campaign finance program on Thursday, September 12.

0091.00150; Similar recall efforts have recently targeted Senate President Leroy Garcia of Senate District 3.
0091.00151; The petition needed 11,304 signatures to recall Lee, who was targeted for sponsoring legislation to create a paid family and medical leave program to be funded by a mandatory fee on businesses and employees.
0091.00152; Garcia, who won his reelection in November with more than 70% of the vote, was targeted for recall after voting for a bill to restrict oil and gas production in Colorado.
0091.00153; If proponents for Garcia's recall gather 13,506 signatures by the petition deadline of October 18, the effort will trigger a special election that could be held in District 3 in early 2020. Continue Reading - 1 min read Close  Back to all posts  Carlo Aguja
0092.00001; top story  Letters to the Editor: Give $50 to teachers for school supplies The SC Legislature voted to send $50 income tax rebates to many taxpayers after the SC lottery finally managed to find the winner of the $1.537 billion Mega Millions jackpot, who had $61 million in state income taxes withheld.
0092.00002; File/Staff  Business  SC sets date for mailing out $50 taxpayer rebates from lottery windfall By John McDermott jmcdermott@postandcourier.com  The Post and Courier recently reported that South Carolina will be putting an extra $50 in the pockets of many taxpayers in time for the holiday shopping season.
0092.00003; Lawmakers approved rebate checks earlier this year. More than 1 million taxpayers in South Carolina are expected to qualify.
0092.00004; According to another article, teachers spend a yearly average of $459 of their own money on school supplies for their classrooms.
0092.00005; We had a deficit of hundreds of K-12 teachers in South Carolina at the beginning of the school year.
0092.00006; We all recognize that our teachers are underpaid and overworked. I propose that each household donate the $50 education lottery check to a local public school.
0092.00007; What a great Christmas present for our teachers.
0092.00008; Blame SC Legislature for letting parties call shots What is it going to take for Republicans to address his outrageous behavior, lying and his love affairs with Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un?
0092.00009; When will they address his constant bullying and intimidation? When will they start addressing the concerns of the people?
0092.00010; When will Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell bring to the floor the bill passed by the House addressing gun control?
0092.00011; When will the GOP stand up to the NRA and pass common-sense gun control?
0092.00012; The answer is never.
0092.00013; What happened to the party of free trade, balanced budgets and supporting our allies?
0092.00014; When our Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, they created three branches of government so that there would be an equal balance of power among the branches.
0092.00015; The GOP has allowed Trump to violate the Constitution on a daily basis, the one lawmakers and Trump took an oath to protect and defend.
0092.00016; Come Election Day, the voters will hold them accountable.
0092.00017; Can you imagine former President Barack Obama saying in front of the world that he believed Putin over his own nation's intelligence agencies?
0092.00018; Being a member of Congress means one thing to both Republicans and Democrats: getting re-elected.
0092.00019; When will the American people demand term limits and a new president?
0092.00020; BROOKS P. MOORE  Blue House Road  Ladson  In 2012, then-Mayor Joe Riley started telling us there would be dead bodies floating in the marsh from people trying to evacuate Johns Island if the Interstate 526 extension wasn't built. This became a rallying cry for the pro-526ers and has persisted ever since. SC approves ongoing work on extending I-526, will review full price tag later I have seen no reports of bodies floating in the marsh related to evacuations, whether after Dorian, Irma, Florence, Matthew or any other storms.
0092.00021; This is quite puzzling as so many believed and, indeed, repeated Riley's prognostications of doom, including many local and state-level elected representatives and their appointees to various boards and commissions. Could it be that Mayor Riley was wrong with his fearmongering?

0096.00001; Whether Congress will act this year to address the affordability of prescription drugs  -  a high priority among voters  -  remains uncertain.
0096.00002; But states aren't waiting. So far this year, 33 states have enacted a record 51 laws to address drug prices, affordability and access.
0096.00003; That tops the previous record of 45 laws enacted in 28 states set just last year, according to the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonprofit advocacy group that develops model legislation and promotes such laws.
0096.00004; Advertisement:  Among the new measures are those that authorize importing prescription drugs, screen for excessive price increases by drug companies and establish oversight boards to set the prices states will pay for drugs.
0096.00005; Legislative activity in this area is escalating, said Trish Riley, NASHP's executive director.
0096.00006; This year, some states moved to launch programs that directly impact what they and consumers pay for high-cost drugs.
0096.00007; And more laws could be coming before year's end.
0096.00008; Of the handful of states still in legislative session  -  including California, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania  -  debate continues on dozens of prescription drug bills. In New Jersey alone, some 20 proposed laws are under consideration. Both Democrat and Republican leaders have shown a willingness to pursue strong measures that help consumers but also protect state taxpayer dollars, said Hemi Tewarson, director of the National Governors Association's health programs.
0096.00009; Riley, Tewarson and others note, however, that states can go only so far in addressing rising drug prices, and that federal legislation would be necessary to have a major impact on the way the marketplace works. Federal lawmakers are keeping a close eye on the state initiatives, Tewarson said, to gauge where legislative compromise may lie  -  even as Congress debates more than a dozen bills that target drug costs.
0096.00010; Political divisiveness, a packed congressional schedule and a looming election year could stall momentum at the federal level. Advertisement:  The pharmaceutical industry has opposed most  -  though not all  -  state bills, said Priscilla VanderVeer, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry's main trade group.
0096.00011; We agree that what consumers now pay for drugs out-of-pocket is a serious problem, said VanderVeer.
0096.00012; Many states have passed bills that look good on paper but that we don't believe will save consumers money. Limiting gag rules for pharmacists  At least 16 states have enacted 20 laws governing the behavior of pharmacy benefit managers. The so-called PBMs serve as middlemen among drugmakers, insurance companies and pharmacies, largely with pharmaceutical industry support.
0096.00013; Advertisement:  Those laws add to the 28 passed in 2018. Most of the new laws ban gag clauses that some PBMs impose on pharmacists. The clauses, written into pharmacy contracts, stop pharmacists from discussing with customers whether a drug's cash price would be lower than its out-of-pocket cost under insurance.
0096.00014; With widespread public outrage over gag clauses pushing states to act, federal lawmakers got the message.
0096.00015; In October, Congress passed a federal law banning such clauses in PBM-pharmacy contracts nationwide and under the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit.
0096.00016; The Senate passed it 98-2.
0096.00017; Even so, many of this year's PBM laws contain additional gag clause limitations that go beyond the 2018 federal law.
0096.00018; Advertisement:  Importing cheaper drugs  Four states  -  Colorado, Florida, Maine and Vermont  -  this year have enacted measures to establish programs to import cheaper prescription drugs from Canada and, in Florida's case, potentially other countries. Six other states are considering such legislation.
0096.00019; Medicines in Canada and other countries are less expensive because those nations negotiate directly with drugmakers to set prices.
0096.00020; Advertisement:  This is an area where states once feared to tread, said Jane Horvath, a consultant who has advised Maryland and Oregon, among other states, on prescription drug policy.
0096.00021; Now both Republicans and Democrats view it as a way to infuse more price competition into the marketplace.
0096.00022; Hurdles remain, however.
0096.00023; A 2003 law allows states to import cheaper drugs from Canada but only if the federal Health and Human Services Department approves a state's plan and certifies its safety.
0096.00024; Between 2004 and 2009, the federal government halted nascent drug import efforts in five states.
0096.00025; Even so, momentum for importation has built in recent years in states and Congress as drug prices have continued to rise. And the Trump administration this summer threw its support behind the idea. Ron DeSantis, a Republican and close ally of President Donald Trump's, signed his state's measure into law on June 11, claiming he did so after Trump personally promised him the White House would back the initiative.
0096.00026; Advertisement:  On July 31, HHS announced an action plan to lay the foundation for safe importation of certain prescription drugs.
0096.00027; The plan includes a process to authorize state initiatives.
0096.00028; It also requires formal regulatory review, including establishing Food and Drug Administration safety criteria.
0096.00029; That process could take up to two years.
0096.00030; Two big problems remain: In the weeks since the announcement, the Canadian government has opposed any plan that would rely solely on Canada as a source of imported drugs.
0096.00031; The pharmaceutical industry also opposes the plan.
0096.00032; Creating drug affordability boards  Maryland and Maine enacted laws this year that establish state agencies to review the costs of drugs and take action against those whose price increases exceed a certain threshold.
0096.00033; Advertisement:  New Jersey and Massachusetts are debating similar legislation this year.
0096.00034; Maryland's law establishes a five-member board to review the list prices and costs of drugs purchased by the state and Maryland's county and local governments.
0096.00035; The board will probe drugs that increase in price by $3,000 or more per year and new medicines that enter the market costing $30,000 or more per year or over the course of treatment.
0096.00036; If approved by future legislation, upper payment limits on drugs with excessive price increases or annual costs would take effect in January 2022.
0096.00037; My constituents have signaled loud and clear that bringing drug prices down is one of their top priorities, said state Sen.
0096.00038; Katherine Klausmeier, a Democrat representing Baltimore, who sponsored the legislation.
0096.00039; Advertisement:  Maine's law also establishes a five-member board.
0096.00040; Beginning in 2021, the board will set annual spending targets for drugs purchased by the state and local governments.
0096.00041; Increasing price transparency  This year, four states  -  Colorado, Oregon, Texas and Washington  -  became the latest to enact laws requiring drug companies to provide information to states and consumers on the list prices of drugs and planned price increases.
0096.00042; The majority of states now have such transparency laws, and most post the data on public websites.
0096.00043; The details vary, but all states with such laws seek to identify drugs with price increases above 10% or more a year, and drugs with price increases above set dollar values.
0096.00044; Advertisement:  Oregon's new law, for example, requires manufacturers to notify the state 60 days in advance of any planned increase of 10% or more in the price of brand-name drugs, and any 25% or greater increase in the price of generic drugs. That 60-days' notice was very important to us, said Rep.
0096.00045; Andrea Salinas, chair of the Oregon House's health committee, who represents Lake Oswego.
0096.00046; It gives doctors and patients advance notice and a chance to adjust and consider what to do.
0097.00001; An extension of the solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) would spark $87 billion in new private sector investment and add 113,000 American jobs over baseline estimates by 2030, according to 10-year forecasts released today by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables.
0097.00002; The forecasts come as SEIA ramps up its efforts to secure an extension of the ITC in Congress, and as nearly 20,000 solar and storage professionals descend on Salt Lake City for Solar Power International. These forecasts prove that an ITC extension will continue to deliver real results for our economy and the planet, said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association. The ITC has helped us add billions to the economy, employ thousands of Americans, and be a real solution for cities and businesses that want to do their part to reduce emissions.
0097.00003; We're telling members of Congress to take this climate win now. You don't have to wait for a comprehensive solution to take action on our energy future.
0097.00004; Key Forecast Data:  With an ITC extension, annual investment in solar would reach $41 billion by 2030, more than 141% greater than the $17 billion invested in 2018.
0097.00005; An ITC extension would offset an additional 363 million metric tons of CO2 emissions over the next 10 years, equivalent to 21% of all emissions from U.S. electricity generation in 2018. By 2030, annual offsets will be equivalent to taking 77 million cars off the road or eliminating the emissions from 93 coal plants.
0097.00006; The 82 GW of additional capacity spurred from an ITC extension is enough to power more than 15 million American homes.
0097.00007; Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables developed the capacity forecasts while SEIA extrapolated on this data to develop additional analysis.
0097.00008; The utility-scale segment will see the greatest benefit of the tax credit extension, with 63 of the 82 additional GW coming from that segment, as solar will gain ground against other generation resources based on price competitiveness, said Colin Smith, senior analyst with Wood Mackenzie. Austin Perea, Wood Mackenzie senior analyst added, the distributed solar segment will benefit as well, as a tax credit extension accelerates the timeline for which emerging state markets achieve grid parity relative to our base case outlook.
0097.00009; The solar ITC is currently scheduled to begin stepping down at the end of this year, with the commercial system credit dropping to a permanent 10% in 2022, and the residential system credit phasing out entirely. Read the 2019 Solar ITC Impact Analysis report here.

0102.00001; National  The Australian government is on the brink of a surplus, being only $700 million in deficit.
0102.00002; Labor has pinned the federal government's near return to surplus on the $4.6 billion underspending on the National Disability Insurance Scheme.
0102.00003; Treasurer Josh Frydenberg released new data on Thursday which showed the Australian government was on the brink of a surplus, being $700 million in deficit.
0102.00004; Just an hour after Mr Frydenberg delivered his budget news, employment data was released showing Australia's unemployment rate continued to climb.
0102.00005; Unemployment is now at its highest point in a year at 5.3 per cent, up from about 4.9 per cent earlier this year, with the majority of new jobs being part-time.
0102.00006; The final result for the 2018-19 financial year was a $13.8 billion improvement on the deficit predicted in last year's budget. Lower-than-expected spending on the disability scheme, higher personal income tax receipts and strong iron ore prices are all to thank for the reduced deficit.
0102.00007; While Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said the $4.6 billion underspend on the scheme was because of a slower-than-expected take up, Labor's disability spokesman Bill Shorten said the demand was there.
0102.00008; CommSec chief economist Craig James said on Thursday a balanced budget next year may be more appropriate than delivering a big surplus.

0103.00001; Sep 15, 2019 | Business, Community News, Feature, Government | 0  by Hunter Dawkins  Tuesday night's meeting at the Long Beach School District's Central Office provided new details for the upcoming school year. School Board Member Debra Cook returned from a recent absence due to family concerns.
0103.00002; Following minor changes on the claims docket, the school board unanimously adopted the amended budget for the fiscal year 2019. Long Beach School Superintendent Dr. Jay Smith mentioned this was the fourth year in a row under his administration where money from the school district was put back into the general fund.
0103.00003; After closing out the book, over $800,000 was not spent and placed in the school district's general fund.
0103.00004; Before the budget was adopted, a change in the worker's compensation insurance carrier was made.
0103.00005; The school district's insurance agent Joey Beattie of BXS Insurance, advised the school board of recent premium shifts.
0103.00006; The current carrier was not offering the schools the same benefits while raising the premiums for the schools under workers compensation. When Beattie presented these figures from the analysis done with school board officials, Long Beach School Board President Tim Pierce asked why did the school district's amount increase? Beattie responded with figures from the marketplace and analysis done over the course of a time period.
0103.00007; Subsequently, the school board unanimously accepted the recommendation to turn to the Mississippi Municipal League insurance carrier, as being a self insured provider with a large group. The last lengthy discussion came after the Superintendent recognized a parent of a Harper McCaughan Elementary student to come forward and offer a suggestion about the school district's transportation system. The parent described a few problems with the online version and the elementary school's paper resources.
0103.00008; Avoiding any future problems, the parent thanked the superintendent for allowing discussion amongst the board.
0103.00009; Finally, Dr. Smith acknowledged receiving a letter from the Mississippi Department of Education stating no deficiencies from the school district's accreditation.
0103.00010; According to Smith, this was the first letter the Long Beach School District received in the recent years from the MDE.
0103.00011; After an executive session was called about student matters, the school board adjourned in recess.

0105.00006; KNØX debuts digital custody service with comprehensive insurance 35 minutes ago Source: KNØX Today, KNØX announced the launch of a digital asset custody service for institutions and fiduciaries with comprehensive insurance coverage.
0105.00007; KNØX protects clients such as asset managers, liquidity providers, and exchanges against losses - including both external theft and internal collusion - up to the full value of their holdings.
0105.00008; The KNØX insurance program was developed hand in hand with Marsh, the world's leading insurance broker and risk adviser.
0105.00009; Financial institutions are increasingly gaining exposure to Bitcoin and other digital assets, though insurance policies still fall short - policies are usually structured with limits shared across multiple clients.
0105.00010; This structure can introduce potential counterparty risk. As an example, a customer with $100 million in digital assets may choose to keep their funds with a custodian holding $1 billion in assets, and advertising a $100 million insurance policy.
0105.00011; The custodian is 10% insured, yet the customer is given a false sense of security believing that the $100 million policy will be able to cover their holdings.
0105.00012; In fact, in the event of a total loss, the customer will be reimbursed $10 million, forced to accept a $90 million loss.
0105.00013; The total limit is most commonly shared across clients.
0105.00014; Entities who have their digital assets managed by a third party deserve the right to insurance. Too often, insurance policies are purchased for marketing purposes instead of transferring the risks that matter.
0105.00015; Our insurance program is designed to help fiduciaries meet their obligations. said Alex Daskalov, co-founder and CEO of KNØX.
0105.00016; Commenting on the announcement, Brett Gibson, partner at Initialized Capital and KNØX board member, said: One of the largest issues with the way digital assets are insured by custodians in the market today, is that third-party custodians tend to provide partial insurance, or shared insurance limits, for the assets they custody. Garry Tan, managing partner of Initialized Capital, added.
0105.00017; It's extremely difficult for customers to detect and evaluate the risk exposure these problems create for them and this provides a false sense of security. There is a growing appetite for more comprehensive insurance policies covering digital asset custody. KNØX brings peace of mind to responsible entities that are exposing capital to this nascent digital asset class.
0105.00018; Clients can access their KNØX custody account with a dedicated terminal via a secure end-to-end system.
0105.00019; Internal control policies - rate limits and number of signatories - are set by firms as part of a customized governance model. Related Companies Contributed | what does this mean?

0106.00001; Quick Picks & Lists | Financials  2 Buy-Rated Asset Boutiques Armed To Dominate |  Includes: BLK, IVZ  by: Hans Centena  Hans Centena  Research analyst  Summary  BlackRock's equity valuation becomes challenged but attractive risk/reward remains. The integration of OppenheimerFunds to Invesco remains a key catalyst to Invesco stock.
0106.00002; BlackRock and Invesco are reportedly undergoing secular organic growth tailwinds, but near-term trends lie slightly below its respective strategic management targets.
0106.00003; Image credit: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg  Brokers are looking to expand their offerings of low-cost passive exchange-traded funds (ETF).
0106.00004; These capabilities are only concentrated with a few managers like BlackRock (NYSE: BLK). Currently, there are hundreds of active equity managers who are getting pushed off retail platforms, while institutional investors are shrinking relationships as well.
0106.00005; There is a supply-demand imbalance between asset managers.
0106.00006; Brokers attributed this to the DOL fiduciary ruling that has caused brokers to limit their list of asset manager partners. Investors tend to favor retail brokers that command pricing power, generate strong organic growth and will benefit from higher interest rates. Invesco (NYSE: IVZ) and BLK are two of the very few asset boutiques that are benefiting from these secular headwinds.
0106.00007; The second half of 2019 was a favorable time for most asset classes with the ACWI returning 3.8% and the S&P returning 4.3%.
0106.00008; Fund flows were mixed across assets and fund managers.
0106.00009; Arguably, I believe that fixed income had a stellar performance this year as both the first quarter and second quarter each registering more fund inflows as compared to the entirety of 2018 flows.
0106.00010; It is worth mentioning as well that a smaller but increasing portion of these inflows came from ETFs.
0106.00011; The month of June alone generated $28.5 billion of fixed income ETF inflows.
0106.00012; BLK's iShares assets under management (AUM) in the second quarter grew 5.2% quarter-on-quarter.
0106.00013; Fund inflows registered at $33.2 billion while generating returns of 3.4%, adding $63.5 billion to AUM.
0106.00014; The asset boutique booked an enormous $125 billion long-term fund inflow, on top of the $26 billion of money market inflows.
0106.00015; It includes an unexpected $75 billion of fund inflows into active products which were driven by $64 billion of fund inflows into active fixed income.
0106.00016; 1. Well-Balanced Active And Passive Strategies I expect that BLK would continue to gain a higher market share over the near term.
0106.00017; The secular growth in iShares is supported by cyclical tailwinds in cash management and fixed income.
0106.00018; Near-term fund flows would remain in the mid single-digit organic growth range.
0106.00019; It will be offset by fee rate compression amidst the US economy-driven negative mix shift and transfer towards lower-fee products.
0106.00020; I noted that BLK's record $151 billion of fund inflows underscores the unparalleled breadth of the company's customer reach. The firm is also building stronger relationships with brokerage firms, such as Fidelity (MUTF: FXAIX), to deliver commission-free iShares trading, adding 170 ETFs during 2018 to bring total ETFs on FXAIX's commission-free platform to 240 and driving the strongest inflows in the five-year strategic partnership.
0106.00021; Source: Company data. 2. Lower Than Expected Organic Fee The US-China trade tensions intensified in 2018 and the global economy has been disappointing ever since.
0106.00022; Policy uncertainty is also running high.
0106.00023; There is investor skepticism about the effectiveness of monetary policies.
0106.00024; The global trading order that was decades in the making, and forged under the strong influence of the US, is now being challenged.
0106.00025; A Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) analyst had expected a near-term pressure on the firm's organic growth given a challenging macro backdrop and soft near-term investment performance.
0106.00026; Historically, BLK's P/E multiple yielded a premium to SPX of about 10% when operating income growth was above 10%.
0106.00027; The company exhibited a slower-than-expected organic fee growth in the first half of 2019.
0106.00028; It will be challenging for BLK to deliver more than 10% growth without a significant market rally.
0106.00029; Further, the investors' radar screens are presently focused on the company's downward-trending fee rates.
0106.00030; Long-term base fee rates decreased from 18.5 basis points to 17.9 basis points with fees down across most asset classes due to greater investor preference over funds offering exposure on smart beta and outflows from low-fee institutional offerings. As a result, the company's 3% long-term annualized fund inflows hardly slowed down the decreases in AUM from the adverse market performance, given investor fears of fund outflows at other fund managers.
0106.00031; The lower blended fee rate was due to a mix of iShares fee cuts and continuous divergent beta.
0106.00032; Investors are more selective in picking lower fee funds amidst global volatility which would become less intense, as recent geopolitical uncertainty eases.
0106.00033; 3. Risk/Reward Analysis I'm a Buy on BLK with a price target of $538/share. Source: Seeking Alpha  BLK's historical P/E multiple of 16.5X which is in-line with SPX is considered more reasonable over the near term.
0106.00034; I'm a Buy on IVZ with a price target of $22/share.
0106.00035; Source: Seeking Alpha  Certain strategies are almost identical between IVZ and OppenheimerFunds while there is limited overlap.
0106.00036; That said, investors are confident on IVZ that the deal to acquire OppenheimerFunds would strengthen the combined firm's position across both institutional and retail distribution channels.
0106.00037; But I caution that revenue retention risks would likely remain considerable throughout the integration process.
0106.00038; OppenheimerFunds is more retail-focused, while IVZ is more institutional.
0106.00039; In terms of value proposition, OppenheimerFunds is state-focused (portfolio concentration on municipal bonds), while IVZ is revenue-bond focused.
0106.00040; In terms of high-yield risk profile, OppenheimerFunds is more high-octane yield focused, while IVZ targets less volatile returns.
0106.00041; Acquisition Capital Funding: Debt-Equity Mix In terms of financial model portfolios, as an analyst, I believe that the combination of strategies of both companies should improve Sharpe ratios. OppenheimerFunds should be able to support IVZ's value-based strategies that should help improve solutions-based platforms such as model portfolios, asset allocation and creating the market potential for fund of funds. 1. Potentially More Share Buybacks The company is now more focused on share repurchases as opposed to aggressively ramping the dividend (with a dividend yield of 5.7%).
0106.00042; In terms of integration timeline, IVZ had already expected that the first quarter of 2019 to have a larger cash outflow given taxes and incentive compensation. Source: Company data  The second quarter should see the onset of integration expenses. The company expects to recognize 85% of the $475 million expense synergies towards the end of this year and 100% by the year 2021.
0106.00043; Thus, this time around IVZ would be more aggressive around share buybacks given its current valuation.
0106.00044; But the first quarter of 2019 is expected to be lighter in terms of capital return.
0106.00045; Subsequently, I can anticipate a potential increase in share repurchase activity by the second half of this year.
0106.00046; The higher buyback activity is attributed to the incremental EBITDA from OppenheimerFunds which hovers in the run-rate and directed towards capital return.
0106.00047; 2. OppenheimerFunds Equity AUM Is Down OppenheimerFunds manages $250 billion in AUM, with over $200 billion managed through US-based mutual funds. The mutual fund portfolio is focused on equity funds which are more than 70% of the total portfolio.
0106.00048; More specifically, these are concentrated in International Equities which is around 50% of the total mutual fund AUM.
0106.00049; It is concentrated in the Senior Floating Rate fund at $15 billion in AUM.
0106.00050; OppenheimerFunds has experienced fund outflows over the last several years mostly in its Equity franchise.
0106.00051; AUM is down 8% in the last quarter of 2018, with over $1.2 billion of fund outflows and negative excess returns. As a result, it raised market risks to the company's $10 billion fund outflow assumption throughout the integration period.
0106.00052; However, the speed of fund outflows appears to be moderating recently with the 1% annualized organic decay locked in 2017 and 2018. Hence, the company's fund performance has been challenging most especially on the equity side with three-year and five-year excess returns at -175bps and -140bps, respectively.
0106.00053; I noted that EPS accretion guidance is now $0.24 for 2019 and $0.58 for 2020 versus previous guidance of $0.10 in 2019 and $0.52 in 2020 (a 12% increase on 2020 EPS). Guidance in earnings before income tax and appreciation (EBITDA) is estimated to be higher than $2.6 billion in 2019, versus $2.5 billion in 2020.
0106.00054; Initial guidance was more than $3.0 billion when the acquisition deal was announced. To recap, BLK is considered as the structural winner in the asset management space with significantly promising paths in ETFs, best-in-class diversification across products and geographies as well as significant scale.
0106.00055; On the other hand, IVZ remains on the sidelines, yet there seems to be better visibility around achieving its acquisition synergy target that could potentially enhance the investor sentiment.
0106.00056; BLK remains bullish on market share gains across its major products.
0106.00057; In both active and passive strategies, financial products seem to be accelerating with lower reliance on beta to drive revenue growth amid a higher volatility environment.
0106.00058; IVZ has already outlined a clear and definite direction to enhance organic growth opportunities once the OppenheimerFunds franchises are already integrated.
0106.00059; However, I believe that historically there is only limited success in organic synergies for asset management deals and that it would take a considerable time for these synergies to take effect.
0106.00060; I'm certain that both BLK and IVZ are well prepared and on track to tread these cyclical highs and economic uncertainties. Interest rates have moved sharply lower.
0106.00061; The US Treasury curve has flattened indicating rising investor pessimism due to geopolitical turmoil and increasing trade tensions.
0106.00062; Financial markets are manifesting the greater possibility of a sharper US Fed easing cycle as compared to its earlier forecast in 2019.
0106.00063; I'm still optimistic that the current macro backdrop will not dampen both boutiques' organic growth versus its industry peers in a more range-bound market.

0107.00001; 178-year-old UK travel giant Thomas Cook faces collapse PDB September 22, 2019 TRENDING GIST Edit  Thomas Cook's 178-year existence was hanging by a thread on Sunday after the iconic British travel firm struggled to find further private investment and is now relying on an unlikely government bailout.
0107.00002; The operator said Friday that it needed £200 million ($250 million) or else face administration, which could affect 600,000 holidaymakers and require Britain's largest repatriation since World War II.
0107.00003; A source close to the negotiations told AFP on Saturday that the company had failed to find the cash from private investors and would collapse unless the government intervened.
0107.00004; But ministers are unlikely to step in due to worries about the pioneering operator's longer-term viability, the Times reported on Saturday, leaving it on the brink.
0107.00005; We will know by tomorrow (Sunday) if agreement is reached, the source told AFP.
0107.00006; The firm's creditors held a marathon meeting on Sunday to try and work out a deal, with a meeting of the board of directors to be held later.
0107.00007; The group issued a last-ditch plea to creditors to reduce the £200m funding demand or restructure the debt, which was now being considered, according to Sky News.
0107.00008; The Transport Salaried Staffs Association, which represents workers at the company, called on the government to save the firm. The company must be rescued no matter what, said TSSA General Secretary, Manuel Cortes.
0107.00009; Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey called on the government to step in by taking an equity stake to avoid this crisis.
0107.00010; Foreign minister Dominic Raab promised tourists affected that they would not end up stuck abroad. I can reassure people that in the worst-case scenario, the contingency planning is there for people to avoid being stranded, he told BBC's Andrew Marr Show.
0107.00011; Two years ago, the collapse of Monarch Airlines prompted the British government to take emergency action to return 110,000 stranded passengers, costing taxpayers some £60 million on hiring planes.
0107.00012; The government at the time described it as Britain's biggest-ever peacetime repatriation.
0107.00013; -  Jobs threat  -   But holidaymakers were already reporting problems, with guests at a hotel in Tunisia owed money by Thomas Cook being asked for extra money before being allowed to leave, according to a tourist interviewed by AFP.
0107.00014; After an hour they left the hotel and are currently at the airport, said a spokesman for the Tunisian interior ministry.
0107.00015; The group's activities would cease immediately in the event of bankruptcy, forcing its travel agencies to close, grounding its planes and leaving the group's 22,000 global employees  -  9,000 of whom are in Britain  -  out of a job.
0107.00016; Chinese peer Fosun, which was already the biggest shareholder in Thomas Cook, agreed last month to inject £450 million into the business as part of an initial £900 million rescue package. In return, the Hong Kong-listed conglomerate acquired a 75 percent stake in Thomas Cook's tour operating division and 25 percent of its airline unit.
0107.00017; Thomas Cook in May revealed that first-half losses widened on a major write-down, caused in part by Brexit uncertainty that delayed summer holiday bookings.
0107.00018; The group, which has around 600 stores across the UK, has also come under pressure from fierce online competition. Cabinet maker Thomas Cook created the travel firm in 1841 to carry temperance supporters by train between British cities.
0107.00019; It soon began arranging foreign trips, being the first operator to take British travellers on escorted visits to Europe in 1855, to the United States in 1866 and on a round-the-world trips in 1872.
0107.00020; The company was also a pioneer in introducing circular note  -  products that would later become traveller's cheques.
0107.00021; It now has annual sales of £9 billion, serving 19 million customers in 16 countries.

Photo:Reuters  The British government has plans in place to bring home stranded holidaymakers if Thomas Cook goes out of business - an event that would likely spark chaotic scenes at resorts and airports around the world. The bosses of the world's oldest travel company met with lenders and creditors in London on Sunday to try to thrash out a last-ditch deal to keep the company afloat.
0108.00003; The company's board was then expected to decide the company's fate, with the business potentially going into administration on Monday.
0108.00004; Running hotels, resorts and airlines, Thomas Cook has 600,000 customers on holiday, meaning governments and insurance companies could be forced to step in and bring them home if the company goes out of business.
0108.00005; Unions and the opposition Labour party have urged the government to stump up the cash, but the foreign secretary appeared to dismiss that idea on Sunday.
0108.00006; We don't systematically step in with the taxpayers' money when businesses are going under unless there's a good strategic national interest, Dominic Raab told the BBC, adding that plans were in place to prevent anyone from being stranded. The company, founded in 1841, has been fighting for its survival after its lenders threatened to pull the plug on a rescue deal that has been months in the making.
0108.00007; Hurt by high levels of debt, online competition and geopolitical uncertainty, Thomas Cook needs to find another £200 million ($NZ398 million) on top of a £900 million package it had already agreed, to see it through the winter months when it has less cash coming in and needs to pay hotels for summer services.
0108.00008; That has sparked fears among customers on social media that some hotels, yet to be reimbursed by Thomas Cook, could ask holidaymakers to leave if the company collapses.
0108.00009; Some British tourists were briefly detained in a hotel in Tunisia by staff who wanted to know if they had been paid.
0108.00010; The Thomas cook customers have since left and flown home, according to their social media postings.
0108.00011; At the meeting on Sunday the company was asking its lenders to restructure or lower their demands.
0108.00012; It has also asked credit card companies to release £50 million that they hold as collateral against the company's bookings. The company's largest shareholder, China's Fosun, was due to take a central role in the restructuring. A person familiar with the situation told Reuters there was still a possibility they could strike a deal.
0108.00013; The person declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation. FINAL HOURS  Were Thomas Cook to fail, it would spark the biggest peacetime repatriation effort in British history.
0108.00014; The government and the aviation regulator have drawn up a plan to step in and use other airlines to bring Britons home if needed. The person familiar with the situation put the cost of that move at about £600 million.
0108.00015; On top of the British holidaymakers, some 460,000 other customers are also abroad, with many coming from Germany or Scandinavia.
0108.00016; An official from Germany said under that country's rules, it would fall to insurance companies to help get customers home. Condor, a German airline owned by Thomas Cook, said in a statement that its parent company was doing everything it could to secure fresh funds.
0108.00017; Negotiations with all key stakeholders are complex and ongoing.
0108.00018; The Condor flights are currently being operated on a regular basis.
0108.00019; News of Thomas Cook's potential demise has sparked alarm not just across the holiday resorts and poolside bars where customers are using social media to obtain updates, but among suppliers and future customers who are losing faith.
0108.00020; That is draining the company of the liquidity it needs to keep operating and ramping up the pressure on one of Britain's oldest and much-loved companies.
0108.00021; According to figures from the UK-based aviation consultancy IBA Group, all but a handful of its 116 aircraft are leased rather than owned directly.
0108.00022; So far there are no visible signs that leasing companies are demanding their planes back, preferring to sit out the refinancing talks.
0108.00023; Hi Annie, I understand your father might be unsettled by all the news surrounding Thomas Cook and our business recently but our flight operations continue to operate as normal, the company said in response to one worried customer. British foreign minister Raab also sought to reassure holidaymakers that they would not end up stuck overseas.
0108.00024; We ... hope that it (Thomas Cook) can continue but in any event, as you would expect, we've got the contingency planning in place to make sure that in any worst-case scenario we can support all those who might otherwise be stranded.
0108.00025; At the board meeting, the company would decide whether in the short term it has enough cash to pay its debts, and whether it has a reasonable prospect of paying its liabilities in six to 12 months' time, which is predicated on its securing a deal.
0108.00026; At the earlier meeting the lenders will have to decide whether they want to continue supporting a company that has 19 million customers a year, spread across 16 countries.
0108.00027; While it once pioneered package holidays and mass tourism, in recent years it has struggled to pay the interest on its £1.7 billion debt, while navigating events such as a coup in Turkey, a heatwave in Europe, fluctuating oil prices and the aggressive summer pricing of low-cost airlines like Ryanair and easyJet.

0109.00001; Share Mirvac's development in Melbourne, the Eastbourne, boasts million-dollar apartments in an inner city Eden.
0109.00002; Buyers of the apartments - which boast concierge and specially crafted door-handles and tapware -  include Mirvac director Elana Rubin.
0109.00003; Ms Rubin splashed out $1.89 million for her apartment. Her purchase was one that investors would not be told about in any Mirvac annual report, raising questions about the company's adherence to related-party disclosure requirements.
0109.00004; Rob Homer The $12.2 billion development giant argues no specific declaration about an acquisition is required because shareholders were already told directors had the opportunity sometime to purchase apartments somewhere.
0109.00005; Directors can also be offered discounted deposits and early access on choosing properties, although that's also not made clear in the annual report. Still, Sydney-based Mirvac has stood by its declarations, maintaining they adhered to regulations.
0109.00006; Deals were at arm's-length even if these benefits were not offered to all the public, Mirvac said, because no one receives a discount on the final price.
0109.00007; Related Quotes To declare, or not declare The circumstances surrounding top-brass purchases are an illustration of how companies can choose from a wide range of approaches to related-party disclosures and determining arm's-length transactions.
0109.00008; Both companies maintained they had adhered to disclosure obligations.
0109.00009; Other companies break down details to small amounts.
0109.00010; Saracen Mineral noted in 2017 that $8,768  had been paid to non-executive director Martin Reed's private company for due diligence work.
0109.00011; Cardno, a 6000-staff ASX-listed engineering firm, in 2019's half-year results disclosed consulting services with its own major shareholder of $48,510. Australian Securities and Investments Commission guidance notes from 2011 stated that related-party deals should be declared unless the disclosure may confuse investors by dealing with inconsequential matters. Advertisement Ms Rubin is among the directors who have purchased Mirvac developments.
0109.00012; Property databases show she entered into a $1.89 million sale agreement in 2016 at Eastbourne, whose glossy advertising trumpeted how a life of effortless luxury awaits next to Melbourne's Fitzroy Gardens.
0109.00013; Prices for apartments in the complex vary above and below the price that Ms Rubin paid. Other buyers not from Mirvac include conservative power couple Peta Credlin and Brian Loughnane. Eastbourne sold out within two years of launch, with apartments settling in 2019 and this financial year.
0109.00014; Mirvac managing director Susan Lloyd-Hurwitz is also a purchaser but no record has yet appeared.
0109.00015; Artist impression of The Eastbourne.
0109.00016; Mirvac said its annual report meets proper disclosure requirements despite not divulging specific purchases. Through the annual report we disclose that executives and directors are entitled to purchase residential property on the same terms as other employees, a spokeswoman said.
0109.00017; The annual report does not specify these terms. Yet Mirvac confirmed its people could purchase apartments with a lower deposit. It said this was akin to a deal offered to first-home buyers, which sees them pay an initial 5 per cent deposit instead of a 10 per cent deposit.
0109.00018; In some cases, such as with Eastbourne, directors and executives are also offered priority access  -  similar to VIP purchasers being allowed early purchases on projects.
0109.00019; Mirvac maintained that when supply is limited and demand strong on projects, no one receives early access.
0109.00020; Advertisement Purchases with related parties, under the Corporations Act, need shareholder approval if not at arm's length. Mirvac policies describe arm's length as transactions conducted as if the parties were not related. Mirvac dismissed the notion that early access or discounted deposits cross that threshold.
0109.00021; The relevant point of interest is the transaction, its spokeswoman said.
0109.00022; Employees and directors pay the full amount, just like any member of the public.
0109.00023; The pool at Mirvac's Eastbourne in Melbourne.
0109.00024; In relation to the early purchase availability, apartments are priced according to their location within the project, the spokeswoman said. Everyone pays the same price regardless of timing, she said.
0109.00025; Mirvac added that no purchaser, including a director, would receive a reimbursement if further incentives or discounts were provided on other properties in a development.
0109.00026; The company also rejected any conflict of interest would arise for a director about apartment pricing or continuation of a project in which they had bought. Advertisement They do not participate in these types of operational issues, Mirvac maintained.
0109.00027; A diverse approach Professor Ross Grantham, a commercial law expert at the University of Queensland's TC Beirne School of Law, said, in general, that company declarations about related-party dealings were at times marked by an inconsistent interpretation of the rules.
0109.00028; You're always going to get some diversity in approach, he said.
0109.00029; Laws surrounding conflicts of interest and disclosures nowadays favoured the efficient flow of business as opposed to control and accountability, he argued.
0109.00030; A definitive threshold is if any transaction would prejudice shareholders or could influence a director's decision.
0109.00031; Then it has to be disclosed, he said. Questions about arms-length transactions also depended on business and corporate culture, with some potentially affected by the aggressiveness of their legal or accounting advice, he said. Share 4 mins ago 6 mins ago 11 mins ago 17 mins ago
0110.00001; HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. shale producers have added millions of barrels to global crude supply in recent years, but that does not mean they can quickly replace barrels lost from weekend attacks on Saudi Aramco facilities, energy experts said on Sunday.
0110.00002; FILE PHOTO - A pump jack operates in the Permian Basin oil and natural gas production area near Odessa, Texas, U.S., February 10, 2019. REUTERS/Nick Oxford  Shale producers this year have been cutting budgets and workers and trimming production goals after years of heavy spending. They remain under intense pressure from investors to restrain spending and return money to shareholders through buybacks and dividends rather than expand drilling.
0110.00003; Shale is a short-cycle oil supply - one able to add or reduce production relatively quickly.
0110.00004; Producers will see increased demand, especially from Asian buyers.
0110.00005; But producers need 90 to 180 days to drill, complete and bring new production online. There are about 1,000 Permian wells that have been drilled but not completed or hooked up to pipelines, said Bernadette Johnson, vice president of market intelligence at consultants Enverus.
0110.00006; Shale cannot simply open up the spigot, she said, adding: The infrastructure simply isn't there yet to get it to the coast.
0110.00007; Representatives for Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N), which all produce shale, declined to comment on the potential impact on their operations.
0110.00008; If the attacks lead to sustained U.S. oil prices in the mid-$60-a-barrel range, it could cause U.S. output to grow by about 2 million barrels per day (bpd) next year, from about 1 million bpd this year, Johnson said.
0110.00009; U.S. oil companies could see some benefit.
0110.00010; The strikes in Saudi Arabia knocked out oil-processing facilities and production at the Khurais oilfield, which produces a light oil similar to what shale producers offer. The Eagle Ford Shale field in South Texas has the ability to add to supplies and prices in the mid-$60s would cause companies operating there to add rigs gradually.
0110.00011; Still, its ultralight, sweet barrels are not similar enough to be a good substitute for lost Arab Light oil, Johnson said.
0110.00012; Shale producers generally could use the expected jump in crude prices to add hedges, or contracts that lock in future prices, allowing them to capture some of the expected price increases, said Matt Portillo, managing director at investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Producers will take the higher prices and essentially bank that to balance-sheet repair or to accelerating shareholder returns, Portillo said.
0110.00013; U.S. oil companies operating in the Permian Basin will not be changing their plans this week based on what happened in Saudi Arabia, said Andy Lipow, president of consultancy Lipow Oil Associates.

Saturday, September 14th 2019, 1:41 PM HST By Annie Grayer and Veronica Stracqualursi, CNN But a deeply personal moment on the campaign trail Friday spoke to how much the issue of affordable health care affects Americans.
0112.00002; Fresh from the Democratic debate , the Vermont senator began his two-day swing in Nevada with a town hall, where people opened up and got intensely personal about their issues with health care.
0112.00003; During the Friday event in Carson City, a Navy veteran named John shared with Sanders that he is $139,000 in debt because his health insurance, Tricare, a program for the military, is no longer accepted.
0112.00004; Sanders listened intently as John, who said he served 20 years in the military, revealed that he has been diagnosed with stage four Huntington's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder.
0112.00005; When asked by Sanders how he is going to pay off his debt, John said, raising his voice, I can't, I can't, I'm gonna kill myself.
0112.00006; The senator cut him off -- Hold it.
0112.00007; John, stop it.
0112.00008; You're not gonna kill yourself.
0112.00009; Stop it, Sanders said.
0112.00010; I can't do this, John said with frustration in his voice.
0112.00011; I have Huntington's disease.
0112.00012; Do you know how hard it is?
0112.00013; You know, you probably don't, do you?
0112.00014; I can't drive.
0112.00015; I can barely take care of myself.
0112.00016; Alright, let's chat later at the end of the meeting, okay?
0112.00017; Sanders said to John. As promised, Sanders and his wife Jane spoke with John after the campaign event ended.
0112.00018; Sanders shared with CNN that in this conversation with the veteran, he made sure his team got the correct contact information.
0112.00019; What I wanted to make sure is that I got the correct information because what I did not want to happen is just him talking about his story but not being able to follow up with him, Sanders said.
0112.00020; He told me he doesn't answer his phone very much because there are bill collectors calling him up every day, Sanders said of what he learned when speaking with the veteran further.
0112.00021; Sanders also shared that his team has already gotten in touch with one of the Nevada senators about this veteran's situation.
0112.00022; We have already been in contact with one of the Nevada senators.
0112.00023; We're going to get in touch with the entire Nevada Congressional delegation to get him the help that he needs, the Vermont senator said.
0112.00024; We will follow up on Monday, Sanders later added.
0112.00025; Here is somebody who put his life on the line to defend this country, a veteran, dealing with a terrible, terrible illness, and what was obviously very unsettling is when he used the word suicide, Sanders told CNN when reflecting on his interaction. That was the most dramatic and painful moment of the whole town meeting, he added.
0112.00026; This should not be going on in America, not for a veteran, not for any person in this country, and it is beyond comprehension that under the current healthcare system, somewhere like a half a million people go bankrupt every year because of medical bills, Sanders told CNN.
0112.00027; Clearly we are not doing what we should be doing to make sure that every veteran in this country gets all of the quality healthcare they need when they need it, he said.

0113.00001; World  Corporate  Politics & Government  Merkel coalition seals US$60 bil deal to fight climate change Bloomberg  /  Bloomberg  September 20, 2019 22:48 pm +08  -A +A  (Sept 20): Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling coalition agreed on a landmark package totaling about 54 billion euros ($60 billion) by setting a price on carbon-dioxide emissions for transport and providing incentives for cleaner technologies.
0113.00002; Her goal is to get Germany's climate policies back on track, easing mounting pressure at home and giving her something to showcase at a UN conference next week.
0113.00003; Merkel said Germany has learned from its struggles to lower emissions in recent years and will continue to evaluate the program to ensure the country meets its targets to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions.
0113.00004; We've created numerous incentives, so that people can behave in a more environmentally responsible way, said Merkel.
0113.00005; We believe we can reach these targets.
0113.00006; Germany doesn't expect the plan to require the government to raise more debt.
0113.00007; The costs for incentives such as promoting electric vehicles and upgrading older furnaces will be balanced by income from carbon-dioxide certificates. The deal was reached after more than 16 hours of overnight negotiations that began Thursday evening in Berlin. Germany's leaders were under pressure to seal a deal, with the country falling far short of its climate goals.
0113.00008; Tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered to march in Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and around 500 other locations across Germany as part of the Fridays for Future movement.
0113.00009; Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said the demonstrations have been a wake-up call. Key Initiatives:  Carbon Pricing  -  The centerpiece of the plan puts a price on carbon-dioxide emissions for transport and buildings that will rise from 10 euros a ton in 2021 to 35 euros in 2025. Auto Shift  -  Conventional cars will become costlier to operate, with higher taxes for more polluting cars.
0113.00010; Incentives will be available for electric vehicles costing less than 40,000 euros, and charging stations will be expanded.
0113.00011; Air to Rail  -  Taxes will be increased for flights and decreased for rail tickets, and state rail operator Deutsche Bahn AG will get an extra 1 billion euros a year in capital to build up the country's rail infrastructure and public transport.
0113.00012; Building Upgrades  -  The government will offer grants and tax rebates for installing new furnaces, windows and insulation and will ban new heating oil furnaces from 2026.
0113.00013; Merkel has faced a series of protests this year demanding action to stem emissions, and the Green party has surged in the polls as the impact of global warming becomes increasingly tangible, with forests fires more frequent and droughts causing the Rhine river to recede.
0113.00014; Mind the Gap  Some of the SPD leaders had indicated they would push for the party to leave Merkel's coalition if the government didn't agree on substantial climate measures. Alongside the environmental concerns, the plan could increase spending at a time when Germany faces calls to boost its slowing economy.
0113.00015; Merkel, who has said her government will react depending on the situation, has so far resisted calls for a preemptive move to revive growth.

0115.00001; National  The Australian government is on the brink of a surplus, being only $700 million in deficit. Labor has pinned the federal government's near return to surplus on the $4.6 billion underspending on the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg released new data on Thursday which showed the Australian government was on the brink of a surplus, being $700 million in deficit.
0115.00002; Just an hour after Mr Frydenberg delivered his budget news, employment data was released showing Australia's unemployment rate continued to climb. Unemployment is now at its highest point in a year at 5.3 per cent, up from about 4.9 per cent earlier this year, with the majority of new jobs being part-time.
0115.00003; The final result for the 2018-19 financial year was a $13.8 billion improvement on the deficit predicted in last year's budget. Lower-than-expected spending on the disability scheme, higher personal income tax receipts and strong iron ore prices are all to thank for the reduced deficit.
0115.00004; While Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said the $4.6 billion underspend on the scheme was because of a slower-than-expected take up, Labor's disability spokesman Bill Shorten said the demand was there.
0115.00005; CommSec chief economist Craig James said on Thursday a balanced budget next year may be more appropriate than delivering a big surplus.

0116.00001; (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes were set for their best day in two weeks on Wednesday after President Donald Trump said a trade deal with China could happen sooner than expected, while Nike shares hit a record high on upbeat quarterly results.
0116.00002; FILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 18, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid  Wall Street had a sluggish start after Democratic lawmakers moved to launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump, adding fresh uncertainty for markets already roiled by the U.S.-China trade tussle and worries over slowing global economic growth.
0116.00003; Trump's comments were in contrast to his harsh rhetoric on Tuesday on the trade dispute, which rattled global stock markets on Wednesday.
0116.00004; Its good news that (Trump) thinks the talks are making progress, but ultimately what investors want to see is a signed agreement, said Michael Geraghty, equity strategist at Cornerstone Capital Group.
0116.00005; The talks with China continue but as we have seen in the past, apparent progress is later undone because of a hard-line stance by either both countries or one of the countries.
0116.00006; Nike Inc (NKE.N) shares jumped 3.7% to a record high and were among the top boosts to the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI and the S&P 500 .SPX after the company's first-quarter results beat market expectations.
0116.00007; Footwear retailer Foot Locker Inc (FL.N) gained 2.3%.
0116.00008; Boeing Co (BA.N) rose 1.8% after the aircraft maker said it created a new permanent safety committee in the aftermath of two fatal 737 MAX crashes.
0116.00009; The stock touched a more than 5-1/2 month high earlier in the session.
0116.00010; Shares in Philip Morris (PM.N) surged 6.1% after the tobacco company called off merger talks with Altria Group Inc (MO.N) and said it would instead focus on the U.S. launch of its tobacco-heating product, iQOS.
0116.00011; The trade-sensitive Philadelphia chip index .SOX gained 0.70%, while the broader technology sector .SPLRCT rose 0.45%.
0116.00012; Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were in the black, with the defensive utilities .SPLRCU, real estate .SPLRCR and healthcare .SPXHC sectors on the back foot. I don't think the impeachment issue is weighing on markets, or will weigh on markets (in the near term) ... However, if it eventually results in gridlock in Washington, then that certainly could concern investors and we could see that being reflected in stock prices, Cornerstone Capital's Geraghty added.
0116.00013; At 13:09 ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 149.81 points, or 0.56%, at 26,957.58 and the S&P 500 .SPX was up 9.26 points, or 0.31%, at 2,975.86.
0116.00014; The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was up 34.94 points, or 0.44%, at 8,028.57.
0116.00015; Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N) rose 7.7% and was among the top gainers on the S&P 500 after activist investor Elliott Management renewed its demand for splitting the company into three.
0116.00016; Chipmaker Broadcom Inc (AVGO.O) dropped 3.3% and was the biggest loser on the S&P 500 after it priced an upsized offering of convertible preferred stock.
0116.00017; Data showed that sales of new U.S. single-family homes rebounded more than expected in August, a sign that the struggling housing market was starting to get a lift from lower borrowing rates.
0116.00018; Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.17-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.35-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 5 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 17 new highs and 90 new lows.

0118.00001; Impaired visionWeWork sparks worries about Masayoshi Son's Vision Funds Private valuations of tech unicorns may have got out of step with public-market appetite  print-edition icon Print edition | Business twitter icon  facebook icon  linkedin icon  mail icon  print icon  WEWORK'S BUILDING in Tokyo's Shibuya district is a cross between an iceberg and a plastic bottle passed through a shredder.
0118.00002; Fitting, then, that the office-rental firm's abortive listing, shelved on September 17th, threatens a financial shredding for its mastermind, Masayoshi Son - and that the debacle may be the tip of an iceberg for his $100bn Vision Fund (VF).  Mr Son bet on Adam Neumann, WeWork's charismatic co-founder, after meeting him for half an hour in 2017. SoftBank, the Japanese group Mr Son controls, and the VF then gave the firm $4.4bn, despite its tenuous claim to techiness.
0118.00003; Mr Son would reportedly have handed over another $16bn this year had Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund, the VF's biggest backer, not objected.
0118.00004; But SoftBank gave WeWork $2bn anyway.
0118.00005; All told, the VF and SoftBank have invested or committed to invest $10.65bn in the firm and own 29% of it.
0118.00006; Get our daily newsletter  Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.
0118.00007; Had WeWork gone public at $20bn (less than half the valuation of $47bn in its latest funding round), the VF and SoftBank could under one scenario have faced unrealised losses of up to $7.5bn, estimates Atul Goyal of Jefferies, an investment bank.
0118.00008; As sentiment soured, partly owing to WeWork's weak corporate governance, reports surfaced of Mr Neumann contemplating a value as low as $10bn.
0118.00009; WeWork will again attempt to list later this year - presumably with a better story about governance and path to profit. Still, an initial public offering (IPO) may prove hard. Investors may be disinclined to embrace a stock with a good chance of losing value quickly.
0118.00010; If WeWork cannot raise new capital, Mr Son may have to come up with cash to keep it going. SoftBank's own share price has fallen by 20% since July. Even with the IPO on ice, and no price set, the VF and SoftBank may still need to adjust WeWork's fair value.
0118.00011; That means the VF's stated returns may still have to be lowered when market prices are eventually taken into account.
0118.00012; In June it reported $20.2bn of gains on total investments of $71.4bn. Some were realised many were paper gains on hard-to-value investments. The deeper worry is that unicorn valuations in the private market may have risen materially above what public-market investors will pay in an IPO, says Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research.
0118.00013; Many of the VF's 83 investments could suffer unrealised losses if and when they go public. True, it could enjoy post-IPO share-price rises. Shares in Guardant Health, a VF-backed diagnostics firm, have more than tripled in price since its IPO in 2018.
0118.00014; But Uber's shareholders have seen 30% of its value wiped out since it listed in May.
0118.00015; The VF is looking at more unrealised losses, of $3.9bn, on the ride-hailing firm, Jefferies reckons.
0118.00016; The WeWork fiasco comes as Mr Son's $108bn Vision Fund 2 was about to start. In August he said he would begin spending its cash within a month or two. Memorandums of understanding have been inked with investors.
0118.00017; Worries about tech IPOs and an economic slump may make it harder to close.
0118.00018; The Saudi fund and Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment, another big investor in the original VF, are reportedly considering whether to scale back their investment in the new one.
0118.00019; An executive at one big sovereign-wealth fund says SoftBank may need a face-saving way to reduce the new VF's size. Markets are too toppish to try and deploy another fund of that scale.
0118.00020; The VF says WeWork, one of many firms in the portfolio, gets too much attention. And Mr Son, who lost most of his wealth in the first dotcom bubble, is no stranger to the ups and downs of venture investing.
0118.00021; WeWork's Mr Neumann has admitted to feeling humbled by the delayed IPO. His cheerleader-in-chief is probably not.

0119.00001; Hedge funds are cashing in on the crisis at Thomas Cook.
0119.00002; As the 178-year-old travel agent battled for survival, data showed that its shares were the most bet-against in the UK.
0119.00003; About 10.7 per cent of its shares were being 'shorted' yesterday, with the positions taken by hedge funds thought to be worth at least £5.7million.
0119.00004; But the paper profit some have made over the past six months is likely to be far higher, as Thomas Cook's share price crashed 89 per cent over the period.
0119.00005; Thomas Cook shares are the most bet-against in the UK  Among the vultures betting against the stricken firm is Whitebox Advisors, which was one of a handful of funds that made a killing by betting against the US sub-prime mortgage market in the run-up to the financial crisis.
0119.00006; That deal was known as 'The Big Short' and was later depicted in a film of the same name starring Christian Bale and Steve Carell.
0119.00007; Share  A short position is effectively a bet that a company's stock price will fall.
0119.00008; Short-sellers borrow shares from investors at a set price and aim to return them when the share price falls, pocketing the difference in value. This means that if a company goes bust, short-sellers don't have to pay anyone back because the shares are worthless, but they are still paid the difference in price from when they borrowed them.
0119.00009; Russ Mould, investment director at broker AJ Bell, said: 'If the firm collapses, hedge funds will be left with substantial gains.'
0119.00010; Last-ditch talks: Thomas Cook chief executive Peter Fankhauser  Some hedge funds have also bought swathes of Thomas Cook's debt and taken out credit default swaps, which essentially function as insurance if it goes bust.
0119.00011; Thomas Cook was fighting for survival after its lenders  -  including Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds  -  made a shock demand for more cash to keep it going during the quiet winter period. The firm had previously agreed a £900million rescue deal with creditors and shareholders, but the banks said an extra £200million was needed on top of this or they would pull support  -  potentially forcing bosses to call in administrators.
0119.00012; Round-the-clock talks were taking place over the weekend to break the impasse, amid the prospect of up to 165,000 customers who are abroad being left stranded if Thomas Cook goes under.
0119.00013; There were calls for the Government to bail out the company, but ministers have refused, saying it would set a precedent for any big firms that were in trouble.
0119.00014; Thomas Cook chief executive Peter Fankhauser, 58, was understood to be leading last-ditch talks in London yesterday.
0119.00015; He had earlier emailed employees to thank them for continuing to work and vowed not to 'let this business fall over without a fight'. Airline rivals are expected to tussle over the firm's assets if it goes under, including 200 landing slots at Gatwick and Manchester airports.
0119.00016; And about £1.6billion in retirement obligations would also be transferred to the Pension Protection Fund, with pensioners facing 10 per cent cuts to their nest eggs.
0119.00017; Thomas Cook did not comment last night.
0120.00001; Sep 21, 2019 Victoria Mutual Investments Limited (VMIL) has announced the acquisition of a 30 per cent stake in Barbados-based FinTech Company, Carilend Caribbean Holdings Limited. The alliance was announced Thursday, September 19, at a press briefing held at the AC Hotel Kingston. VMIL was attracted to this unique investment opportunity due to the value of the emerging technology which has the potential in other areas of finance with the ability to scale within the Caribbean.
0120.00002; This certainly represents a long-term investment for our shareholders, said VMIL's CEO Rez Burchenson. The building society's investment gives the business two seats on Carilend's five-member board of directors.
0120.00003; These seats will be held by Devon Barrett, director of VMIL and Chief Investment Officer of the VM Group and Peter Reid, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Building Society Operations at the VM Group.
0120.00004; Carilend  -  The first Peer to Peer Lending Company in the Caribbean, was founded in 2015 by two directors, Mark Linehan and Mark Young.
0120.00005; Young, the CEO of the Barbados-based business has a 25-year track record as a regional senior executive with Barclays and CIBC in the Caribbean.
0120.00006; According to the Young, this partnership between VMIL and Carilend is the first step in expanding Carilend's FinTech capabilities across the region.
0120.00007; We aim to deliver the same convenience, ease, speed and great rates for borrowers and investors that we have already delivered in Barbados.
0120.00008; We look forward to launching our FinTech platform in Jamaica later this year and further expanding in the Caribbean in 2020, he said.

0121.00002; An investor, who purchased shares of Valaris plc (NYSE: VAL), filed a lawsuit over alleged violations of Federal Securities Laws by Valaris plc in connection with certain allegedly false and misleading statements. Investors who purchased shares of Valaris plc (NYSE: VAL) have certain options and should contact the Shareholders Foundation at [email protected] or call +1(858) 779  -  1554.
0121.00003; According to the complaint the plaintiff alleges on behalf of purchasers of Valaris plc (NYSE: VAL) common shares between April 11, 2019 and July 31, 2019, that the defendants violated Federal Securities Laws. More specifically, the plaintiff claims that between April 11, 2019 and July 31, 2019, the defendants failed to disclose to investors that the Company was plagued by a weak ultra-deepwater segment, massive cash usage, and significant negative cash flow, that the foregoing was reasonably likely to have a material negative impact on the Company's second quarter 2019 results, that the merger leading to Valaris's establishment could not deliver on its touted benefits, and that as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

0122.00001; Dave Mosher/Business InsiderA house in Boca Chica Village, formally known as Kopernik Shores, where SpaceX is building out a rocket launch complex.
0122.00002; However, the company built its experimental spaceport in and around , a decades-old community of about 20 older residents.
0122.00003; Due to what it says is and other concerns, SpaceX mailed letters to residents offering to their properties at three times their appraised value.
0122.00004; The buyout letter, obtained by Business Insider on Tuesday, states that the company did not anticipate that local residents would experience significant disruption from its presence.
0122.00005; Several told Business Insider they do not plan to accept the offer, which expires in less than two weeks. .
0122.00006; It takes a village to raise a rocket  -  or at least it does in South Texas, where SpaceX has built an experimental spaceport around a small community of residents.
0122.00007; Now, according to interviews with residents and a proprietary offer letter obtained by Business Insider, SpaceX is trying to buy as much of that town as it can and move the people out. But many of them say they may not accept the company's offer.
0122.00008; Maria Pointer (bocachicaMaria)Maria and Ray Pointer's yard offers a window into SpaceX's efforts to develop a Mars launch system called Starship.
0122.00009; This photo shows the Starhopper prototype on January 10, 2019.  SpaceX got approval in July 2014 to build a commercial spaceport and launch orbital-class rockets from the area.
0122.00010; It soon abandoned that plan after a number of setbacks and a push by Elon Musk, the company's founder, to develop a new, fully reusable, and Mars-capable rocket system called Starship.
0122.00011; Since then, SpaceX has built and launched a crude rocket-powered prototype called Starhopper as high as 500 feet in the air.
0122.00012; The company lifted the vehicle off a concrete pad it built near Boca Chica Beach, just 1 1/2 miles east of the nearest residence in the village.
0122.00013; But following an accidental brush fire, public safety notices warning of possible explosions, and a push to have the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approve orbital-class launches with larger rockets, SpaceX is trying to buy out Boca Chica entirely.
0122.00014; Google EarthAn overview of the Boca Chica area in south Texas circa 2017. Residents both in-state and out-of-state told Business Insider they began receiving buyout offer letters by express mail on Monday.
0122.00015; Though a commercial real-estate company called JLL appears to be handling the offers, SpaceX had the offers printed on its company letterhead.
0122.00016; At least 10 residents who own about one-third of the homes in the area have received letters so far, though ostensibly all property owners in the vicinity of SpaceX's facilities were approached by the company about a buyout. When SpaceX first identified Cameron County as a potential spaceport location, we did not anticipate that local residents would experience significant disruption from our presence, the letter states.
0122.00017; However, it has become clear that expansion of spaceflight activities as well as compliance with Federal Aviation Administration and other public safety regulations will make it increasingly more challenging to minimise disruption to residents of the Village.
0122.00018; Read more: Elon Musk's SpaceX is developing giant Mars rockets in a sleepy town in southern Texas. Here's what it's like to visit.
0122.00019; Given that increased disruption to Boca Chica residents, it says, and a need to comply with public health and safety rules, SpaceX would like to acquire the properties located in Boca Chica Village.
0122.00020; The letter added that SpaceX is committed to a fair and equitable process for acquiring this real estate and, to that end, the company hired an independent firm to appraise each property. Business Insider/DocumentCloudA redacted version of SpaceX's buyout offer letter sent to residents of Boca Chica Village, Texas, in September 2019.  SpaceX is offering you three times the independently appraised fair market value of your property, the letter said.
0122.00021; The offer is good through two weeks from the date of this letter.
0122.00022; The note is dated September 12, indicating the cutoff date for the offer is September 26  -  just two days before Musk is due to deliver a presentation on the Starship development program near the village.
0122.00023; The amount of this offer is not negotiable, the letter continues.
0122.00024; SpaceX believes that it is very important to offer the same deal to all residents using a consistent approach for determining the amount offered for each property.
0122.00025; This is the fairest approach.
0122.00026; For those who commit to a sale, SpaceX said it will cover closing and other real estate costs.
0122.00027; It also comes packaged with an additional perk:  SpaceX recognises that your close proximity to its operations has offered a unique opportunity to experience at close-hand the development of what will be the world's most advanced rocket.
0122.00028; In appreciation of your support, we will offer all residents of the Village who accept the purchase offer the opportunity to continue their connection with the development of Starship by extending an invitation to attend future private VIP launch viewing events that are unavailable to the public.
0122.00029; Many villagers may not take SpaceX's deal, though Dave Mosher/Business InsiderWeems Road is the main path through Boca Chica Village and was unpaved until SpaceX showed up.
0122.00030; Although SpaceX seems to want to buy out the entire village, approximately 10 property owners plan not to accept the deal, and for a variety of reasons, residents told Business Insider.
0122.00031; Maria Pointer, who lives in Boca Chica and helps run a Facebook group that follows and generally supports SpaceX's activities, said her paperwork was turned to mush because it blew into a puddle and got soaked to the point of illegibility.
0122.00032; But she said if the replacement offer she is mailed is three times the appraised value of her and her husband Ray's property, then the couple will likely not accept the deal. Trevor Mahlmann/ReutersStarhopper  -  SpaceX's first Mars Starship prototype  -  hovers over its launchpad during a test flight in Boca Chica, Texas, on August 27, 2019.
0122.00033; I really do want to get out of SpaceX's way, and I want them to succeed and do what they're supposed to do, said Pointer, who lives in the area year-round and plans to retire there. But I also want them to support me also, and it's also not going to be at an eminent domain price.
0122.00034; Celia Johnson is another resident who plans not to accept the offer.
0122.00035; Johnson was born and raised in nearby Brownsville, has lived part-time in her Boca Chica home since 1997, and has two sisters who also own homes there.
0122.00036; She said the offer  -  and what she fears is a possible forced removal in the future if she declines it  -  makes it feel like her dream home is being taken away through a hostile takeover.
0122.00037; They determined what they are going to pay us for our homes and they give us a 2-week deadline to decide, Johnson said.
0122.00038; I am not going to be bullied into selling under their conditions.
0122.00039; Pointer said the offers do not account for the unique wilderness and view of Boca Chica, which sits less than two miles from a public beach, was peaceful and quiet before SpaceX arrived, and is surrounded by thousands of acres of coastal, bird-filled wildlife refuge.
0122.00040; She also claims a handful of families do not have the financial means, even with a three-times-appraised-value offer, to buy equivalent properties elsewhere.
0122.00041; They need to understand that most of this community has very limited income, she said. We want to move on, just give us what we need to move on.
0122.00042; I'm not going to go to a trailer or an apartment.
0122.00043; I gave my life to this property. I gave it everything I had. Nobody else wanted to tame it.
0122.00044; Business Insider contacted SpaceX for comment, but the company did not immediately provide a statement.

0124.00001; Area Stocks Sep 13, 2019  Backer of bank's '08 launch earlier this week sold $5.5M worth to company, officials  authors Geert De Lombaerde  An investment firm that was a key backer of CapStar Bank's launch more than a decade ago has sold its remaining shares days after striking deals with the bank holding company and a group of its officers and directors.
0124.00002; New York-based Corsair Investments helped get CapStar up and running in 2008, playing a big role in the bank's $88 million capital raise  -  then a record for a startup Tennessee bank.
0124.00003; Early this year, the firm said it owned more than 1.5 million shares, or 8.3 percent, of CapStar.
0124.00004; On Monday, CapStar and 10 of its officials collectively lightened that stake by 356,910 shares and Corsair officials  -  who typically aim to hold investments between three and six years  -  have now found buyers for their remaining shares. CapStar President and CEO Tim Schools told the Post he is heartened by the transactions of the past week and what they mean for CapStar's base shareholder going forward. Eight-and-a-half percent of our company sold this week without the stock price falling, Schools said.
0124.00005; I think that speaks well of the interest in our bank.
0124.00006; Late Friday morning, shares of CapStar (Ticker: CSTR) were changing hands at $15.90, up nearly 1 percent on the day.
0124.00007; They began the week at $15.45 and are essentially unchanged over the past six months. Corsair has since 2008 been represented on CapStar's board by Richard Thornburgh.
0124.00008; Following the addition of two representatives of the former Athens Bancshares, which CapStar last year bought for $114 million, the company's board now has 13 members.

0125.00001; The Northern Irish bus-maker could collapse into administration next week without a rescue deal, Sky News understands.
0125.00002; Friday 13 September 2019 18:28, UK Image: The company could be forced to appoint administrators if a rescue deal is not forged The Ballymena-based 'Boris Bus' maker Wrightbus will this weekend hold last-ditch talks with a prominent Irish transport executive in a bid to stave off collapse.
0125.00003; Sky News has learnt that Darren Donnelly has emerged as the leading contender to acquire Wrightbus, which employs about 1400 people and counts Transport for London (TfL) among its biggest customers. Sources said that without a rescue deal being concluded by next week, the company could be forced to appoint administrators. The news comes just seven weeks after Boris Johnson told the House of Commons that the government would do everything we can to salvage Wrightbus's future.
0125.00004; Asked by the DUP MP Ian Paisley whether ministers would step in to save the company, the prime minister said: It was of great value to the people of this country and I think it's a great company and we will make sure, I give my assurance, we will do everything we can to ensure the future of that great UK company.
0125.00005; Advertisement It was unclear on Friday evening whether the government had any formal role in discussions about rescuing Wrightbus.
0125.00006; The Routemasters commissioned by Mr Johnson during his tenure as Mayor of London, which became known as 'Boris Buses' because of their distinctive look, are made by Wrightbus.
0125.00007; More from Business Talks between Mr Donnelly and Wrightbus's advisers are understood to have accelerated in recent days amid fading hopes of a takeover by Weichai, a subsidiary of the Chinese company Shandong Heavy Industry.
0125.00008; A source close to Weichai said it remained possible that it could acquire Wrightbus but conceded that the possibility had begun to recede.
0125.00009; A number of other bidders are also said to have walked away from the process amid a series of deadlines this week.
0125.00010; Image: Wrightbus makes the Routemasters commissioned by Boris Johnson as Mayor of London Mr Donnelly is a former co-chairman of and shareholder in Retlan Group, a manufacturer of articulated trucks.
0125.00011; Retlan was sold to a Chinese buyer, CIMC Vehicles, in 2016.
0125.00012; The urgency of the talks involving the fate of Wrightbus underline the importance of its role as one of Northern Ireland's most prominent exporters.
0125.00013; If Wrightbus did collapse, it would be a severe blow to the local economy following job losses at Bombardier, the aerospace group, and the crisis at shipbuilder Harland and Wolff.
0125.00014; Sky News revealed in July that Wrightbus had hired Deloitte, the professional services firm, to court potential buyers after a financial downturn that has left it facing heavy losses.
0125.00015; Annualised losses are currently running to approximately £15m, and the company may need a capital injection of at least £30m, insider said in July.
0125.00016; Wrightbus has had a presence in Ballymena for decades.
0125.00017; Sir William Wright, who founded the company with his father in 1946, was knighted in last year's new year's honours list for services to the bus industry and the UK economy.
0125.00018; In its current form, Wright Group became the world's first developer of a hybrid-electric double-decker bus in 2006.
0125.00019; Wright Group, which also counts Volvo and the Kowloon Motor Bus company in Hong Kong among its big export customers, has already been forced into making redundancies. In June last year, it said it was axing 95 jobs across its operations in a move which angered union representatives at Unite.
0125.00020; That followed an identical round of cuts three months earlier.
0125.00021; In addition to its bus-making unit, Wright Group encompasses a chassis design arm, EN-Drive.
0125.00022; Neither Wright Group nor Mr Donnelly could be reached for comment, while Deloitte declined to comment. More stories

Bakare's Profile: On his part, Bakare holds a Higher National Diploma in Accountancy from the Yaba College of Technology Yaba, Lagos.

0128.00001; Photograph: Yui Mok/PA  National Grid began cutting hundreds of staff from the unit responsible for keeping the lights on several months before Britain's biggest blackout in a decade, the Guardian has learned.
0128.00002; The owner of Britain's power system is reducing the workforce at its energy system operator division by a quarter, under a programme that will take aim at the part of the company responsible for managing the electricity system. The 1,148-strong team will shrink by almost 280 staff to 870, through a mix of voluntary redundancies and redeployments, in plans which have been under discussion since last summer.
0128.00003; The energy giant, which made profits of £1.8bn in the last financial year and hiked dividends to its shareholders, is under investigation by the industry regulator and an emergency government committee following the 9 August blackouts which left millions without electricity, and caused major travel disruption.
0128.00004; One former National Grid employee said hundreds of senior staff have already left the unit, but the cuts were not made public because the majority were voluntary redundancies and agreed on very good terms which are protected by non-disclosure agreements.
0128.00005; National Grid hopes to get rid of more experienced, better paid staff, and replace them with less experienced, lower paid workers, according to the source. The company's regulated business plans show that the group will replace some of the staff with an extra 250 workers by the end of 2021.
0128.00006; The source said the energy giant's older staff are understood to be on final salary pensions, whereas newer staff are less of a burden on the company's pension scheme. A spokesman for the electricity system operator said the changes have had no impact on the day-to-day running of National Grid's electricity system control room in Wokingham.
0128.00007; He added that staffing levels and rotas remain tightly regulated to ensure a resilient electricity system which provides good value for customers.
0128.00008; The decision to shrink the number of highly skilled workers has emerged despite warnings from one of its own senior executives that National Grid has been walking blind into the risk of blackouts for over a year.
0128.00009; Alan Whitehead MP, the shadow energy minister, said: Given recent blackout events and near misses it is important that National Grid retains the skills and expertise needed to keep the lights on, trains running and hospitals powered.
0128.00010; Cutting jobs and losing skills raises concerns that shareholders and dividends are being considered before their duty to serve the public.
0128.00011; The August blackout, the biggest in a decade, struck just months after the energy system operator was hived off from National Grid's central business in April this year.
0128.00012; The legal separation took place following growing political pressure for the company to be broken up because of claims from experts that running the energy system, while also owning and operating energy infrastructure, represents a conflict of interests.
0128.00013; Steve Thomas, the national secretary of the Prospect trade union, said: National Grid ESO has made a significant number of people redundant at considerable loss of expertise and experience. With the business plan proposing the rehiring of 250 workers over the next couple of years it is our concern that one of the drivers for redundancy, and the decisions about who was offered redundancy, was shareholder concern rather than retaining the skills the company needs to maintain grid resilience now and in the future. National Grid did not directly respond when asked why it planned to reduce its staff before rehiring in the coming years.
0128.00014; A spokesman for the group said: We remain committed to building and investing in a skilled and highly trained workforce that meets the changing needs of managing the UK's electricity system, both now and in the future. Jillian Ambrose Energy correspondent
0129.00001; One of the biggest sticking points in client-agency relations is the disagreement over the interpretation of the conflict policy. As an agency search consultant, I constantly see this in pitches.
0129.00002; Too often an agency, much to its chagrin, is forced to decline an invitation to compete because a client has a rather broad view of what amounts to a competitive conflict.
0129.00003; Agencies have lamented for years that conflict restrictions are just an emotional knee-jerk policy and lack true merit. They point out that clients can be inconsistent in their protocol.
0129.00004; While they enforce a strict, uncompromising conflict policy with their ad agencies, they are more flexible when consulting firms like McKinsey handle their competitors, simultaneously.
0129.00005; Getty  Historically, advertising agencies in the U.S. and Europe did not work with clients who were competitors, at the same time.Thus, an agency could not handle Coke and Pepsi simultaneously, or McDonald's and Burger King or Budweiser and Miller, for example.
0129.00006; However, in recent years we have seen clients loosening restrictions about account conflicts and limiting this to direct competitors, as opposed to blanket prohibitions against working for rivals.
0129.00007; Thus, Pharma companies, for example, view conflicts by indication, not as company-wide.
0129.00008; This hybrid model has long been practiced in Japan. By relying on safeguards and splitting account assignments among different units within or across an agency network or holding company, clients allow greater flexibility.That is how WPP, for example, can work with P&G, Unilever, Kimberly-Clark and Colgate-Palmolive at the same time.
0129.00009; Confidentiality and safeguards are not the only reasons for clients to enforce a conflict policy. Some clients use it to deny competitors access to talent.
0129.00010; This is a clever strategy considering the shrinking talent pool on Madison Avenue.
0129.00011; However, last week, the conflict policy was redefined in a dramatic way. McDonald's bombshell announcement that it is moving its creative account from DDB to Wieden & Kennedy was unusual: Wieden handles rival fast-feeder, KFC, and both agreed to co-exist under the same roof. This is a truly dramatic development, marketing's interpretation of the prophecy, The wolf and the lamb shall feed together.
0129.00012; The agency managed to convince both restaurants to let it work with them simultaneously, but separately, from its fairly autonomous offices.
0129.00013; I suspect that the clincher was access to Wieden'sNNNN talent, arguably the best in the business.
0129.00014; The desire of both McDonald's and KFC to tether it to their business in the hyper competitive fast food category helped them to overcome old fashion conflict restrictions. McDonald's U.S. Chief Marketing Officer Morgan Flatley told Ad Age, At this point, [the conflict] doesn't concern us. We wanted to make the decision around getting the best work that this business deserves.
0129.00015; Contributing to loosening rules for conflict is the changing nature of the marketing ecosystem.
0129.00016; Consolidation of individual agencies and the small number of holding companies, along with the disappearance of many smaller and midsized shops, has narrowed the pool of shops. This has made clients more receptive in allowing solutions in what, once, might have been ironclad policies that forbade agencies from working on competing accounts.
0129.00017; In any case, conflicts, in my opinion, were always more an emotional trigger than a real problem.
0129.00018; Advertising legend Jerry DellaFemina might have been right when he quipped, There are no client conflicts, only bad explanations.
0129.00019; It's time, perhaps, for clients to relax conflict policies.
0129.00020; Account conflicts are a way of life for agencies.Once an agency has acquired clients in key business categories, to keep growing means that it begins to bump into conflicts. And, this is a major problem, especially at a time when agency margins are razor thin and their financial health is challenged.
0129.00021; This makes conflicts sometimes an issue of survival, not just an issue of safeguarding proprietary information. Agencies need all the accounts they can get.
0129.00022; Smart clients actually help their agencies get around and manage conflicts, rather than erect roadblocks.
0129.00023; As long as agencies with competing clients meet clients' expectations regarding confidentiality, reasonable firewalls can be erected.
0130.00001; Want to crush competitors?
0130.00002; Step one was hiring away Jon Korngold from General Atlantic, where he'd spent the previous 18 years, including as a managing director and a member of its management committee.
0130.00003; Step two has been for Korngold, who is responsible for running the new program, to build a team, which he has been doing throughout the year, bringing in people who speak the language of Blackstone, he says, including from TCV, Andreessen Horowitz, Carlyle, Vista Private Equity, NEA, and SoftBank .
0130.00004; Apparently, the group is now ready for business.
0130.00005; It has already closed on two deals from existing pools of capital with Blackstone, including acquiring outright the mobile ad company Vungle.
0130.00006; According to Korngold, two more term sheets are being signed imminently. We talked with him last week for more information about what the group is shopping for, what size checks it is willing to write, and which firms it views as its biggest rivals for deals (and more). Our chat has been edited for length and clarity.
0130.00007; TC: You've been hiring throughout the year people who have large-scale growth equity backgrounds. Are many of them women?
0130.00008; JK: Blackstone is one of the most diverse organizations [in terms of] gender or ethnicity.
0130.00009; In general, it's a huge priority for the firm and within our group of 20 people, 40 percent are female, a number we hope to get to 50 percent. Hiring is still in process, but it's a really healthy culture.
0130.00010; TC: How many people does Blackstone employ altogether?
0130.00011; JK: There are 2,600 altogether across 24 offices. TC: Is your group investing a discreet pool of capital?
0130.00012; JK: At some point, we'll have a dedicated pool of capital, but as a firm, we've been investing in growth equity for some time [so have relied on other funds within Blackstone to date]. TC: There's no shortage of growth equity in the world right now.
0130.00013; What is Blackstone building that's so different? JK: The sheer scale of the operation is different. We have nearly 100 operating professionals  -  employees of Blackstone  -  who were hired because they are functional experts  -  from pricing experts to process engineering experts to human capital and procurement and digital marketing experts  -  and who can advise our companies.
0130.00014; Also, Blackstone can holistically assist a company through [our] growth equity and real estate and procurement and debt [groups] and other related infrastructure support, enabling companies to fight way above their weight class.
0130.00015; We have 6,000 people across our portfolio, and that provides an interesting opportunity for our companies to cross pollinate [and to cross-sell to] one another.
0130.00016; Unlike most growth equity firms, we also have a significant number of data scientists who do three things: identify proprietary signals across asset classes to help instruct where we should be hunting help our companies monetize their data and help us in our diligence. They'll access raw data feeds and almost see the matrix, if you will.
0130.00017; TC: How many data scientists are we talking about?
0130.00018; JK: A couple dozen [across Blackstone].
0130.00019; TC: Blackstone must be competing against fast-growing tech companies for data scientists.
0130.00020; How do you convince them that work for an investing giant is the better gig?
0130.00021; JK: If you're an intellectually curious individual, there are so many signals [coming through Blackstone] that it's almost a proxy for the world. It's like manna from heaven. It's not like they're doing a single-threaded approach.
0130.00022; The nature of the challenges across our companies is so vast and so varying that whether you're looking at a fast-growing retailer or a cell phone tower in another country, the nature of the tasks is always changing.
0130.00023; TC: SoftBank seems to have shaken things up a bit when it came on to the scene, given the size checks it is writing.
0130.00024; Your boss, Steven Schwarzman, who recently talked with us about this bigger new push into growth equity, made sure to note that there are few organizations that can write $500 million checks.
0130.00025; Everyone in Silicon Valley wants to talk about SoftBank.
0130.00026; We celebrate a lot of what SoftBank has done.
0130.00027; They've validated the thesis that there's an opportunity for growth equity on a scale that hasn't traditionally been available.
0130.00028; It's similar to the way we're set up.
0130.00029; SoftBank was never meant to compete with the venture community they're competing with the capital markets, and as private companies look to stay private longer market, SoftBank wants to support their development.
0130.00030; JK: I think the reality is that a lot of businesses have unproven business models and unit economics, and they're garnering massive amounts of capital from different constituents.
0130.00031; It's less about who is staying private longer but are they sustainable over the long run, whether public or private.
0130.00032; I think a lot of companies right now now that have unproven business models have been flooded by cash at too small a scale where they aren't ready to handle it, and it masks weaknesses. TC: Where is that most acute, in your view?
0130.00033; JK: I see that at the smaller growth equity phase  -  the $25 million to $150 million [per firm per check] range  -  where most growth equity resides because you have every VC firm there now.
0130.00034; Many of the growth funds that have moved downstream.
0130.00035; You also have crossover funds like DST and Coatue and Tiger, along with corporate venture capital.
0130.00036; That huge flood of capital has created these massive valuations and it has compressed the due diligence involved.
0130.00037; If you look at Lyft and Uber  -  and Snap was in this category  -  the market is starting to speak.
0130.00038; Public market shareholders are willing to give you the benefit of the doubt for a while but not indefinitely.
0130.00039; You can't feed the machine for growth's sake.
0130.00040; TC: So what type of deals are you searching out?
0130.00041; JK: We won't step into a situation where unit economics aren't proven from day one.
0130.00042; You won't see us in a company that's selling $1 for 80 cents and hoping someday that works.
0130.00043; We're Inherently more binary in profile.
0130.00044; We're capital-preservation minded while looking for asymmetric upside, and that's where we have a disproportionate advantage.
0130.00045; You'll see us do deals where we can put our thumb on the scale, because of our real estate holdings or buyout assets or because [search across our] portfolio for help with procurement costs or insurance or R&D or a company's go-to-market strategy.
0130.00046; TC: What have you done that proves all these bells and whistles make a difference?
0130.00047; JK: We have a couple of signed deals, including [the mobile ad company] Vungle [for a reported $750 million-ish], though we're more often looking for growth-equity minority ownership positions.
0130.00048; [Think] companies that are looking for a partner and not an owner.
0130.00049; We'll do growth buyouts but the vast majority will be significant minority positions.
0130.00050; We have a couple of other deals that will be signed imminently that we can't discuss just yet.
0130.00051; TC: Are you hoping to take these companies public?
0130.00052; Flip them to another private equity firm?
0130.00053; Relatedly, do you have any thoughts about the public market and whether more companies should be going out?
0130.00054; JK: We'll only look to an IPO if there's a reason for it.
0130.00055; Oftentimes, companies shouldn't be public sometimes, they should be, including if they need an acquisition currency or [to better establish their] branding.
0130.00056; But the idea of, let's rush to the door [is not our style].
0130.00057; TC: Who are your most direct competitors?
0130.00058; Not Vista Private Equity, since it seems to prefer buying companies whole.
0130.00059; JK: Vista is going exclusively for control buyouts, massive turnarounds.
0130.00060; It descends upon a company and says, 'This is the playbook you will follow.'
0130.00061; It also uses a lot of leverage, where the vast majority or our [deals] are un-levered.
0130.00062; We don't use much debt.
0130.00063; Vista and Silver Lake are much more competitors with each other.
0130.00064; TC: KKR then? Carlyle?
0130.00065; KR: They're also multi-asset managers, but as it relates to growth equity, we've really found ourselves in slightly more rarefied air.
0130.00066; Blackstone has demonstrated that it can use its scale to create an operational advantage, and virtually no other company  -  or few  -  can contemplate checks like we can.
0130.00067; TC: What do you want for these checks, other than a minority position?
0130.00068; How involved are you and what size stake, exactly, are you aiming to buy? JK: We want to have a relevant voice, so we want to be in the boardroom, but there is no target range.
0130.00069; It can be 10 or 20 or 30 percent.
0130.00070; It can be 80 percent.

0133.00001; Vance's office issued a subpoena to Mazars in late August demanding eight years of Trump's personal and corporate tax returns, The New York Times reported earlier this week.
0133.00002; The order is part of state prosecutors' investigation into whether The Trump Organization illegally reported a hush money reimbursement as a business expense. In response to the subpoenas issued by the New York County District Attorney, we have filed a lawsuit this morning in federal court on behalf of the President in order to address the significant constitutional issues at stake in this case, Jay Sekulow, a personal attorney for Trump, said in a statement.
0133.00003; Shortly before the 2016 presidential election, Cohen gave adult film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet about an alleged sexual relationship with Trump.
0133.00004; He is now serving out a three-year prison term.
0133.00005; While the president has made various promises about releasing his tax returns ― including the apparent lie that he was under audit and could not release them until that process concluded ― he has so far refused to make them public, breaking with decades of presidential tradition.
0133.00006; This isn't the first time he's sued to prevent them from seeing the light of day.
0133.00007; Back in July, he filed suit against House Democrats after the Ways and Means Committee demanded six years' worth of tax returns.

0134.00001; National  Josh Frydenberg says we shouldn't panic in the face tensions between the US and Iran.
0134.00002; Tax refunds and a stronger housing market have consumers significantly readier to spend on housing and potentially retail, new data shows. But the impact of the trade war between the United States and China, as well as tension with Iran, are creating worries for Australian businesses.
0134.00003; Commonwealth Bank Household Spending Intentions research shows a significant lift in consumer positivity is underway.
0134.00004; Spending intentions are improving in Australia, with a combination of income tax refunds and a stronger housing market leading the charge, CBA chief economist Michael Blythe said on Tuesday. Significantly, the home-buying spending intentions series has moved back into positive territory and this should help drive a further improvement in retail spending intentions in the months ahead.
0134.00005; But the ANZ-Roy Morgan weekly Australian Consumer Confidence index paints a different picture.
0134.00006; It recorded a 4.8 per cent slide in people's expectations for their finances over the next 12 months. While households feel okay about their current financial situation, they are clearly quite worried about the outlook, for both their own finances and the economy, ANZ economist Felicity Emmett said. This is a disappointing development and suggests that expectations for tax and interest rate cuts to spur the consumer to lift the economy may be misplaced.
0134.00007; Mr Blythe said the tax refunds flowing into CBA accounts were about 40 per cent above normal levels.
0134.00008; The boost to household spending power is larger and coming through sooner than originally expected, Mr Blythe said.
0134.00009; The better news is that this tax refund money seems set to flow through to consumer spending.
0134.00010; Treasurer Josh Frydenberg urged the Australian business community not to overreact to fears of a full-blown military conflict between the US and Iran. Donald Trump has declared the US is locked and loaded to take on Iran over its alleged role in the weekend bombings of Saudi oilfields. The federal treasurer acknowledged this escalating rhetoric - along with Brexit and the ongoing US-China trade war - were weighing heavily on investors.
0134.00011; But in a speech to the Business Council of Australia, Mr Frydenberg will implore companies not to panic.
0134.00012; Global trade tensions, Brexit and the recent targeting of oilfields in the Middle East give investors reason to pause, he will say in Canberra on Tuesday night.
0134.00013; Now in times of global economic and political uncertainty, it is more critical than ever to provide stability and certainty in our economic settings and not get drawn into overreacting.
0134.00014; Devastating floods, fire and drought are also hurting communities and detracting from the economy, the treasurer will tell business leaders.
0134.00015; But the government's strong fiscal management and the ongoing resilience of the Australian economy should provide business with the confidence to invest, to grow, to innovate and to employ, he will say.

0136.00001; Thomas Cook set for last-ditch rescue talks The tour operator will hold a crisis meeting with key players on Sunday in a bid to avoid insolvency.
0136.00002; Image copyrightPA Media  Thomas Cook is to hold crisis talks in a final bid to secure a rescue deal.
0136.00003; The meeting with its biggest shareholder and creditors is understood to be scheduled for Sunday morning at City law firm Slaughter & May.
0136.00004; The tour operator could fall into administration within days unless it finds £200m in extra funds.
0136.00005; It comes as holidaymakers staying at a hotel in Tunisia owed money by Thomas Cook were reportedly prevented from leaving the resort until it was paid. The government has been urged to step in to bail out the company amid fears its collapse could leave about 150,000 British tourists stranded. Concerned customers have been reminded on social media that they have Atol protection  -  a sort of industry-backed insurance  -  in the event that Thomas Cook goes into administration.
0136.00006; The travel firm also reassured customers on Saturday night that flights continue to operate as normal.
0136.00007; 'Held hostage' Guests at the Les Orangers beach resort in the town of Hammamet, near Tunis, said the hotel was refusing to let them leave because of concerns about Thomas Cook's future. Customers have reported that the hotel is asking visitors to pay extra money amid fears it will not be paid what it is owed by the tour operator for bookings. Ryan Farmer, from Leicestershire, told BBC Radio 5 Live the hotel demanded all guests who were due to leave go to reception to pay additional fees, obviously because of the situation with Thomas Cook.
0136.00008; Security guards closed the hotel's gates as guests refused to pay the extra fee, Mr Farmer claims.
0136.00009; He told the Stephen Nolan show: I'd describe it as exactly the same as being held hostage. The Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) union, which represents staff at the struggling travel company, has called on Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom to save Thomas Cook no matter what. Government sources suggest ministers are reluctant to help the firm.
0136.00010; TSSA general secretary Manuel Cortes told Mrs Leadsom it was up to the government to save thousands of jobs and to allow Thomas Cook to flourish.
0136.00011; Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said all viable options for saving the travel giant should be explored.
0136.00012; She added that the government must consider stepping in and taking an equity stake to avoid this crisis.
0136.00013; BBC business editor Simon Jack reported on Saturday that government sources had questioned the financial wisdom of stepping in to save the company. Currently there are 600,000 Thomas Cook customers on holiday, of which 150,000 to 160,000 are British. One of the world's largest travel companies, Thomas Cook was founded in 1841 to operate temperance day trips, and now has annual sales of £9bn.
0136.00014; It employs 22,000 staff, 9,000 of whom are in the UK, and serves 19 million customers a year in 16 different countries.
0136.00015; Image copyrightChloe Hardy Image caption Chloe and her fiance Jack are due to fly to Zante for their wedding  Chloe Hardy from Leicestershire is due to get married in Zante in October and booked the wedding package with Thomas Cook back in June 2018.
0136.00016; Chloe and her fiance will also have 33 family members flying out, with their trips costing more than £33,000 in total.
0136.00017; With the big day looming, Chloe is frustrated by Thomas Cook's handling of their booking.
0136.00018; I have emailed the wedding concierge and co-ordinator, neither has got back to me.
0136.00019; We are unsure if we will be able to fly.
0136.00020; Although it's Atol-protected I have booked three weeks' leave from work and there's no guarantee that I will be able to get time off if I had to rebook.
0136.00021; We've had constant questions from our family that we are unable to answer, she added.
0136.00022; This is causing great concern, worry and stress to all of us involved. Thomas Cook's financial difficulties have mounted over the past year, culminating with the agreement in August of a rescue deal led by its biggest shareholder Fosun.
0136.00023; In July, Thomas Cook produced a business plan saying that it needed £900m in refinancing, up from a previous estimate of £150m.
0136.00024; The £900m would come from Fosun, the group of creditors and some other investors. The group of lenders then commissioned an independent investigation.
0136.00025; Its financial advisers said Thomas Cook would require an additional £200m on top of the £900m already required, which would bring the total refinancing needed up to £1.1bn. Thomas Cook succeeded in finding a backer to provide the additional £200m, but the BBC understands it has since pulled out.
0136.00026; The firm has blamed a series of problems for its profit warnings, including political unrest in holiday destinations such as Turkey, last summer's prolonged heatwave and customers delaying booking holidays because of Brexit.
0136.00027; What are your rights?
0136.00028; If you are on a package holiday you are covered by the Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol).
0136.00029; The scheme will pay for your accommodation abroad, although you may have to move to a different hotel or apartment.
0136.00030; Atol will also pay to have you brought home if the airline is no longer operating.
0136.00031; If you have holiday booked in the future you will also be refunded by the scheme.
0136.00032; If you have booked a flight-only deal you will need to apply to your travel insurance company or credit card and debit card provider to seek a refund.
0136.00033; When Monarch Airlines collapsed in 2017, the government organised to bring home all the stranded passengers, whether they were covered by Atol or not.
0136.00034; Here is more information on Atol protection and Your questions answered  Are you a Thomas Cook customer or member of staff?

0143.00001; Business & Finance  Dylan Gibbons, 4 hours ago 2 min read  According to financial statements released by the Ontario Cannabis Retail Corporation (OCRC), at least $10.2 million was spent on cannabis stores that were never opened.
0143.00002; Of this figure, $8.9 million was spent on equipment and renovation write-offs, while $1.2 million was spent on leases and subsequent lease terminations  -  these were likely connected to a failed store in Guelph which never materialized.
0143.00003; They are basically writing off all the renovation expenses that they had incurred, and the equipment that they'd purchased for the stores, says Brock University business professor Michael Armstrong.
0143.00004; That's $2 million per location, but there may be some other things in there in terms of stuff that they had in the headquarters, or stuff they had in the warehouse that was going to support the retail stores and now they don't need that.
0143.00005; According to an email from OCS spokesperson Daffyd Roderick to Global News, most of the $8.9 million came in the form of transitions between mandates for store fixtures to bolster a larger network.
0143.00006; He says the OCS is now trying to recover the value of these assets.
0143.00007; Armstrong also questioned the types of things being written off, such as computers which are still completely functional and could be resold on the market quite easily.
0143.00008; He believes the fast-paced nature of opening such a large distributor may be the cause of the OCS's rapidly accumulating write off lists and quick abandonment of failed projects.
0143.00009; That could represent maybe a hasty decision, Armstrong says. The OCS is a pretty new organization. It's a little over a year old, so maybe it's lack of experience, but it's also not necessarily a priority.
0143.00010; They're busy trying to get their online sales working properly, they're busy trying to get ready for the new government's private-sector retailing, so 'Let's not waste time, let's get rid of this stuff quickly rather than haggle over some pennies.

0145.00001; Seeking Alpha  Dividend Quick Picks | Financials  |  About: BGC Partners, Inc.
0145.00002; High-level financial performance.
0145.00003; Significant dividend at 15.0% (5-year average).
0145.00004; Undervalued security presents buying opportunity. This is a buy-and-hold trade.
0145.00005; BGC Partners class A common stock (BGCP) currently trades at about $5.62, with a current yield on the $.56 dividend of about 10.1%. The stock took a 24.5% clipping in the first three weeks of December 2018, and is off its December 2017 $10.70 high by 47.7%. The big dip coincides with the completion of BGCP's spin-off of Newmark Group, Inc.
0145.00006; NMRK was roughly 40.0% of BGCP's value.
0145.00007; With each BGCP shareholder getting .4613 shares of NMRK, on spin day worth about $5 per share, BGCP was left at about $6.
0145.00008; BGCP provides market-maker and trader software and related brokerage software technology services to financial (and non-financial) institutions.
0145.00009; Its services include trade execution, broker/dealer services, clearing and post trade information, and so on, related to fixed-income securities, equity and credit derivatives, foreign exchange, swaps, and futures.
0145.00010; The company's Fenics GO operations provide a fully electronic over-the-counter block-trading platform for derivatives and related products trade research, execution, and clearing. Post-spin guidance calls for continued growth in both Fenics and in BGCP's vertical insurance operations. For the first six months of 2019, the Fenics business segment grew at about 22.0% over the first half of 2018.
0145.00011; Fenics currently constitutes about 16.0-17.0% of total revenue, but the portion is growing.
0145.00012; Without NMRK, BGCP's historical revenue growth rate has been about 10.0%.
0145.00013; Because of the spin-off, BGCP's operating common size percentages over the last few years mean little.
0145.00014; However, for the post-spin six months ended June 30, 2019, BGCP earned 6.8% on sales.
0145.00015; At the 10.0% growth rate, 2025 revenue should reach about $3.5 billion, and net income, at 6.8% of sales, would be about $.43 per share.
0145.00016; At today's P/E ratio of about 11 times earnings, EPS of $.43 would price BGCP at only $4.73, whereas it currently trades at a comparatively overvalued $5.50. The P/E appears to be depressed in reaction to the 40.0% drop in sales produced by the spin-off.
0145.00017; If the P/E returns to its historic high and low average ratios (82 times for the high average P/E, 52 times for the low, over the last five years) in 2025, BGCP could easily fetch between $22 and $35 per share.
0145.00018; NMRK continues its restated and post-spin growth at an average of about 15.0%, but is an inconsistent earner.
0145.00019; It is currently trading at about 15 times earnings.
0145.00020; Whether it will maintain this dividend is not known, but the company has followed a policy of extraordinarily high annual payout percentages, and the stock has paid an annual yield of 15.8%, on average, over the last five years.
0145.00021; Risks for BGCP include many things that are largely outside of the company's control.
0145.00022; Continued growth requires a continuation of the economic boom of the last few years without a repeat of the financial crisis conditions experienced in 2008. Things like market volatility and global counter-party risk are important for continued high block trading volumes in swaps and derivatives.
0145.00023; Like all technology-based businesses, BGCP is subject to sudden and rapid product obsolescence based on development of newer, faster, and better technology.
0145.00024; Regulatory risks, and sovereign risks could change the company's operating environment.
0145.00025; Adding to the risk that management can address is the complexity of transactions, layers of deals, multiple partnerships, and so on, that describe BGCP's business. Events and conditions contemplated when deals were made may not prevail in the future, and the effects of such variances may not be well-understood by current management. BGCP also faces considerable foreign exchange risk, with almost 70.0% of revenue generated outside the Western hemisphere.

0146.00001; 4 hours ago 4 hours ago 2 days ago 4 hours ago September 8, 2019 2 days ago 5 hours ago  -  'Revenue alone doesn't make nation wealthy' Stakeholders in the economy yesterday expressed worry about the disparity between huge government earnings and growing poverty in the country.
0146.00002; This followed the report by the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) showing that N28.58 trillion was remitted to the Federation Account between 2012 and 2016. NEITI's latest Fiscal Allocation and Statutory Disbursement (FASD) Audit report for the period shows that of the N28.58 trillion, mineral sources contributed the highest sum of N18.15 trillion (after deductions for joint venture cash calls and subsidy claims), representing 64 per cent of the total earnings. This was followed by non-mineral source (N6.68 trillion), representing 23 per cent, while Value Added Tax (VAT) was N3.73 trillion, representing 13 per cent.
0146.00003; A year-by-year breakdown of the total remittances showed that N4.19 trillion was remitted in 2012 N4.73 trillion in 2013 N4.69 trillion, 2014 N2.89 trillion, 2015 and N1.65 trillion in 2016. An analysis of the N18.16 trillion mineral revenues shared among the three tiers of government showed that the Federal Government received N8.32 trillion from 2012 to 2016 the 36 state governments shared N4.22 trillion, and the 774 local government areas got N3.25 trillion.
0146.00004; This is exclusive of the N2.36 trillion 13 per cent derivation to the oil, gas, and mining producing states.
0146.00005; The report also disclosed that from the share of non-mineral revenue of N6.68 trillion, the Federal Government received N3.52 trillion, the 36 states got N1.79 trillion, and the local government areas took N1.38 trillion.
0146.00006; The total VAT revenue of N3.73 trillion was shared as follows: Federal Government (N560 billion), 36 states (N1.88 trillion) and 774 local governments (N1.31 trillion). Unfortunately, the country remains economically dependent on less-endowed countries because of the less than optimal use of natural resources, made up mostly of products from the extractive industry, said Prof. Segun Ajibola, former president of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria.
0146.00007; He further blamed the country's slow growth and development on its perverse spending pattern, corruption in high places and misplacement of priorities.
0146.00008; Adeola Adenikinju regretted that a few privileged people were mortgaging the nation's wealth.
0146.00009; The director, Centre for Petroleum, Energy Economics and Law (CPEEL), University of Ibadan, noted that without corresponding increase in other assets such as human capital, physical capital and financial capital, the living standards of future generations could be jeopardised.
0146.00010; It is sub-optimal to look for an increase in revenue through the expansion of taxes without first resolving the inefficiency and waste in the use of existing revenues.
0146.00011; We live in a country characterised by heightened insecurity, dilapidated infrastructure, mounting unemployment and poverty, and decline in many welfare indicators. We need, as a country, to reflect and recalibrate our development strategy, he said. Idayat Hassan, who is the director, Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD), maintained that the offices of elected persons were costing the country a fortune.
0146.00012; According to her, Things have to change because 20 years of democracy is enough time for the citizenry to enjoy the dividends of democracy.
0146.00013; Dr. Ndubuisi Nwokolo, Senior Policy, and Research Lead at Nextier SPD, an international development consulting firm, took Hassan's observation further, noting: The cost of sustaining our bureaucracy is obviously very high.
0146.00014; For instance, the 2019 budget has non-recurrent expenditure such as salaries, overheads, and other recurrent items account for 46 per cent of the total expenditure of N8.92 trillion. Considering the level of poverty in the country and the fact that the government is the highest employer, it may be wrong to cut down the size of bureaucracy without having a strong and robust private sector-driven economy, which can employ the majority of its citizens. Similarly, Managing Partner, Chancery Associates, Emeka Okwuosa, said: The cost of governance has to be drastically whittled down.
0146.00015; Bureaucracy has to be streamlined and we have to intensify the fight against corruption.
0146.00016; We have to change our mindset about governance and start realising that we are servants of the people and not vice versa.
0146.00017; But a former Chairman of NEITI, Ledum Mitee, had words of advice for the watchdog agency. Figures of monetary allocations for projects should be linked to what has been achieved, he suggested.
0146.00018; That was why during our time in NEITI, we published the first Fiscal Allocations and Statutory Disbursements Audit, which tracked the extractive revenues to the actual projects.
0146.00019; I would still recommend that report to the national and state Assemblies and other stakeholders.
0146.00020; I would further recommend that NEITI embark on such exercise and improve on it, and also include local governments into such audits as was approved by the Jonathan administration.
0146.00021; According to Mitee, it is important for citizens to use such results to hold governments accountable.
0146.00022; If citizens do not pressure governments on the outcome of works by NEITI and other agencies, the expected benefits might not be achieved, he added.
0146.00023; In another comment on the nation's economy, Prof.
0146.00024; Pat Utomi urged the government to be discreet about pursuing revenue. There is, of course, the tax angle.
0146.00025; Revenue do not make a nation wealthy.
0146.00026; What makes a nation wealthy is a production.
0146.00027; With the way we are chasing revenue, we will prevent people from producing and ultimately democratise poverty, he said.
0146.00028; The professor of political economy disclosed this during the 'Empowered to Break Frontiers' workshop organised by the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Faithful Chapel, Lagos, at the weekend.

0147.00001; The Federal Reserve Open Market committee meeting agreed to lower the central bank's benchmark overnight lending rate to a range of 1.75% to 2.00% on a 7-3 vote, citing ongoing global risks and weakened business investment and exports.
0147.00002; READ: Trump slams Fed Chair Powell, calls for negative rates in early morning Twitter rant In its policy statement, the Fed said that it was cutting rates in light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures even though the US economy continues growing at a moderate rate and the labor market remains strong.
0147.00003; Of the three dissident FOMC voters, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard wanted a 50 basis point cut, while Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Kansas City Fed President Esther George both did not want a rate cut at all.
0147.00004; The statement also revealed little change in policymakers' projections for the economy, with growth seen at a slightly higher 2.2% this year and the unemployment rate to be 3.7% through 2020.
0147.00005; Inflation is projected to be 1.5% for the year, below the Fed's 2% target, before rising to 1.9% next year. Powell says not on a preset course In a news conference after the decision was announced, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the US economic outlook is favorable, with labor markets strong and inflation likely to return to the central bank's 2% inflation goal.
0147.00006; But he added: If the economy does turn down, then a more extensive sequence of rate cuts could be appropriate.
0147.00007; We are going to be highly data-dependent ....
0147.00008; We are not on a preset course.
0147.00009; Powell also acknowledged that strains in funding markets had been bigger than expected, and he said the central bank may need to resume increases to the Fed's balance sheet earlier than previously thought. Aside from the rate move, the central bank also widened the gap between the interest it pays banks on excess reserves and the top of its policy rate range, a step taken to smooth out problems in money markets that prompted a market intervention this week by the New York Fed.
0147.00010; More rate cuts coming, says ING In a note commenting on the rate hike, economists at ING said: We believe more Federal Reserve interest rate cuts are coming.
0147.00011; This week's Chinese data only underlines our fears about global growth story while the latest round of ECB policy easing is unlikely to be the catalyst for a phoenix from the flames like recovery in Eurozone activity.
0147.00012; Add in the rising geopolitical tension relating to Saudi Arabia and Iran, plus Brexit worries and a strong dollar (which is hurting US international competitiveness) and it is clear the US economy will continue to face major headwinds. The Fed also cut rates by 25 basis points in July, which was the first such move since 2008. President Donald Trump had demanded more from Fed officials, whom - in a tweet last week - he insulted as boneheads who have put the economic recovery in jeopardy.
0147.00013; Trump's instant tweet reaction to today's moves was: Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again.
0147.00014; No 'guts,' no sense, no vision!
0147.00015; A terrible communicator!

0148.00001; In:  Business & financeProfiles  September 23, 2019, 3:30 p.m.  In:  Business & financeProfiles  September 23, 2019, 3:30 p.m. Ted Marzilli  CEO Data Products  A growing number of businesses are shunning cash in favor of digital-only transactions, like credit cards, debit cards and electronic transfer, even though most Americans (55%) still prefer cash, according to YouGov Plan and Track data.
0148.00002; Companies like Dos Toros Taqueria, Dig Inn, Sweetgreen, and Amazon Go stores do not accept cash at their locations.
0148.00003; Neither does Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium.
0148.00004; The reason behind the shift toward electronic-only payments include convenience, security, and speed. By not handling cash, employees are able to focus completely on service.
0148.00005; Some have also inferred a class arguement: Tony Zazula, the owner of the now defunct eatery, Commerce, told Eater that: If you don't have a credit card, you can use a debit card.
0148.00006; If you don't have a debit card, you probably don't have a checking account. And if you don't have a checking account, you probably shouldn't be eating at Commerce to begin with.
0148.00007; Zazula and other business owners that have moved away from cash might be making a mistake.
0148.00008; That's because a portion of the so-called Unbanked or Underbanked population bucks the classist label. A segment of this group actually has quite a bit of disposable income, according to YouGov Plan and Track data.
0148.00009; In fact, when compared with the average American on spending cash that's left over after all the bills are paid, cash only shoppers -- those that told YouGov they have no means of paying other than cash -- are more likely to have more than $1,000 remaining for disposable reasons. But there's more to it than just edging out the average American when it comes to having some spare cash left over each month. This group of cash ony shoppers also lines up well against Americans that have a good amount of money for disposable reasons.
0148.00010; That's right: there's no difference between average American households and the households of cash only shoppers when it comes to having between $2,500 and $5,000 left for disposable reasons.
0148.00011; After all the bills are paid, about 7 percent of cash-only shoppers enjoy a healthy amount of left over capital.
0148.00012; Another issue at hand for these businesses that only accept cash is that state and municipal governments are starting to regulate the practice. In 2019, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed a law prohibiting the practice in New Jersey and Philadephia Mayor Jim Kenney did the same in his city. The New York City Council is also considering a ban in 2019.
0148.00013; Some of the businesses that chose cash only, in other words, might not have a choice but to start accepting greenbacks once again.
0148.00014; But according to YouGov's Plan and Track data, there's upside to that move in the form of disposable income from the cash only shoppers.
0149.00001; Indian govt. slashes corporate tax Posted by Editorial Team | Sep 20, 2019 | News  Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced several tax exemptions at the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council meet recently in New Delhi that include slashing effective corporate tax for domestic companies through an ordinance to 25.17 per cent inclusive of all cess and surcharges.
0149.00002; The new tax rate will be applicable from April 1 of this fiscal.
0149.00003; In effect, the corporate tax rate will be 22 per cent for domestic companies, if they do not avail any incentive or concession.
0149.00004; Companies opting for 22 per cent income tax slab would not have to pay minimum alternative tax (MAT).
0149.00005; New domestic manufacturing companies incorporated after October 1 can pay income tax at a rate of 15 per cent without any incentives, implying the effective tax rate for such companies will be 17.01 per cent inclusive of all surcharge and cess, she said.
0149.00006; Tax concessions will bring investments in Make in India, boost employment and economic activity, leading to more revenue, Sitharaman said in Goa. The annual revenue foregone on reduction in corporate tax and other relief measures will be '1.45 lakh cr, she said. Companies can opt for lower tax rate after the expiry of tax holidays and concessions that they are availing now.
0149.00007; The government also decided to not impose enhanced surcharge introduced in the last budget on capital gains arising from the sale of equity shares in a company liable for securities transaction tax (STT).
0149.00008; The super-rich tax will not apply on capital gains arising from the sale of any security including derivatives in hands of foreign portfolio investors (FPIs).
0149.00009; Listed companies that have announced a buyback of shares prior to July 5 will not be charged the super-rich tax, she said. The companies are also now permitted to use their 2 per cent corporate social responsibility (CSR) budget on incubation and national laboratories and institutes.
0149.00010; We are conscious of effect tax rebate will have on the fiscal deficit we will reconcile numbers, Sitharaman added.

0151.00001; LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga.
0151.00002; (Reuters) - The genetic-screening sales reps turn out at health fairs, houses of religion, parks and elder enclaves, offering seniors a chance to learn if they or their loved ones are at risk of developing cancer. All they need, the reps say, is a free cheek swab.
0151.00003; Janet Putrah, a retired university IT supervisor, poses for a photo in her home in Mankato, Minnesota, U.S. September 23, 2019. REUTERS/Nicholas Pfosi  In truth, U.S. federal investigators say, some of the sales representatives are part of a burgeoning industry that threatens to become what multiple government investigators call the next big frontier in healthcare fraud: genetic testing, which is reaping millions of dollars from unnecessary tests that target senior citizens.
0151.00004; Shimon Richmond, assistant inspector general for investigations with the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services, said his office has seen a steady stream of complaints into genetic testing.
0151.00005; In 2018, the inspector general's office received about one or two complaints per week.
0151.00006; Now, he said, the fraud hotline burns with as many as 50 calls weekly. We have investigations going on in this space across the country.
0151.00007; It is not limited to one geographic region, Richmond said in an interview.
0151.00008; This is touching every corner. In all, more than 300 federal investigations, conducted by multiple law enforcement agencies, are examining genetic testing fraud schemes, said a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the inquiries are not yet public. The investigative crush was sparked in part by unusual Medicare billing data patterns that started to emerge in 2015.
0151.00009; In the United States, genetic testing has skyrocketed. For Medicare, the public insurance program for elderly and disabled Americans, payouts for genetic tests jumped from $480 million in 2015 to $1.1 billion in 2018, a Reuters analysis found.
0151.00010; Those figures do not include invoices for spending by state Medicaid programs, which serve the poor, or supplemental Medicare insurance programs offered by private insurers.
0151.00011; The investigations are examining billings submitted to federal health insurance programs.
0151.00012; By law, all diagnostic lab tests must be ordered by a doctor treating a patient for a specific condition.
0151.00013; In the cases under review, investigators and patients told Reuters, marketers get elderly residents to turn over their Medicare or Medicaid information, along with their driver's license and other identifying information, and tell them they will take a free cheek swab that can help them understand their risks of developing cancer or whether their genetics could unlock clues about how they will respond to drug treatments.
0151.00014; They then get a doctor to sign off and approve the test and ship the swab off to a lab, which seeks Medicare payouts.
0151.00015; But many of the lab tests are not relevant to the patient's history, and some of the doctors sign off on the results without conferring with the patient, said investigators familiar with the operations and patients interviewed by Reuters.
0151.00016; Suspect companies pocket thousands, with a cut going to doctors, but the seniors get little, if any, benefit, investigators say.
0151.00017; Brian Benczkowski, the assistant attorney general for the U.S. Department of Justice's Criminal Division, estimated that fraudulent billings submitted over the last few years are expected to total north of $1 billion.
0151.00018; He called genetic testing of the elderly the next big frontier in federal healthcare fraud enforcement. There is a huge pot of money that entrepreneurial criminals are trying to figure out how to access, Benczkowsi told Reuters.
0151.00019; Investigators say genetic testing became a ready target thanks to advances in medical technology and a rise in the technique's popularity. Companies such as 23&Me, which offers health-and-ancestry genetic tests directly to consumers for $199, have entered the mainstream.
0151.00020; Their success, federal investigators say, has drawn the attention of scamsters looking to capitalize on the trend.
0151.00021; Rebecca Kinney, the acting director for the Office of Healthcare Information and Counseling, part of HHS, said seniors should be on the lookout for red flags and any genetic tests should be ordered by their own doctors. The thing that we really try to tell people to pay attention to in any kind of marketing scheme or fraud scheme are the phrases 'Free to you' or 'Free if you have Medicare,'  she said.
0151.00022; In Delray Beach, Florida, Janet Putrah participated in a cheek swabbing event hosted by her condo building's social committee in February 2018. She said none of the tests, which were sent to a lab called Clio Laboratories, made any sense to her. She was stunned to learn the lab billed her Medicare Part B insurance plan more than $30,000 and was paid more than $12,000.
0151.00023; The test results were useless, she wrote in a complaint to the condo board. There were pages and pages with information about drugs. It listed 12 drugs that I may have an 'unfavorable' response to.
0151.00024; I don't take any of the drugs listed.
0151.00025; Putrah said she only participated because her grandmother had died of colon cancer and she was told the test would be paid for by Medicare. In July 2018, she contacted Medicare to raise concerns about her billing statement, and then in December 2018 she called the inspector general's fraud hotline and forwarded supporting documents.
0151.00026; It's my money you're taking from me in taxes, she said.
0151.00027; This is just insane.
0151.00028; Jean Stone, a Medicare fraud specialist who worked for the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and now often testifies as an expert witness, said the test results Putrah received appear useless. They paid $12,000 they shouldn't have paid, Stone said of Medicare, calling the test wasted taxpayer dollars.
0151.00029; Who gets the test results? she asked. They don't even know who the woman's doctor is.
0151.00030; Another condo resident, Arlene Pallack, said her Humana Medicare Advantage plan in 2018 paid for $2,225.17 of the $4,625.42 Clio charged for her cheek swab.
0151.00031; Humana is concerned about the growing health care issue of testing fraud, a spokeswoman said, and targets misuse.
0151.00032; Until she was interviewed by Reuters this August, Pallack had never received the results.
0151.00033; She only got them after calling the lab to inquire.
0151.00034; A spokesperson for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said it uses an aggressive approach to address fraud prevention.
0151.00035; Janet Shaver, the current treasurer of the condo board where Putrah and Pallack participated in the cheek swabbing event, said the board's leadership has since changed, but that she intends to follow up to make as many people as possible aware of this.
0151.00036; Victoria Nemerson, Clio's general counsel, said in a statement that the company's testing is proper and that it has extensive experience providing important testing and laboratory services for physicians and patients. She added: We commit substantial time and resources to meeting our legal duties.
0151.00037; Other companies are also riding the genetic testing wave.
0151.00038; In California, Jean Reeves, Lura Tamm and Patti Falkenberg said they had their cheeks swabbed at a free event in February 2019 by a pleasant woman named Ronda Butman, a sales representative who later told Reuters she worked on contract with two different marketing companies.
0151.00039; One of those businesses was called MyDNACancerTesting the other marketing company went by MedMolecular. The women said Butman told them the genetic test could help predict if they were at risk of developing cancer and tell them how their genetics could impact the way their bodies metabolize their medications  -  a scientific field known as pharmacogenetics.
0151.00040; All three recall being told the cancer and pharmacogenetic screenings would only cost Medicare a few thousand dollars. All they needed to provide, they said they were told, was a swab of their DNA, their Medicare card number, and other sensitive information, which they shared.
0151.00041; But Medicare explanation-of-benefits statements, reviewed by Reuters, revealed that a lab in Arlington, Texas, called Spectrum Diagnostic Labs LLC had in two cases tried to charge Medicare more than $15,000 per patient, and received around $5,000.
0151.00042; I'm worried about my Medicare information and my Social Security out there.
0151.00043; I thought 'My gosh, they've got all of this information,'  Falkenberg said.
0151.00044; Before taking part in genetic testing, public records show, he had filed for bankruptcy in 2012, had been convicted of misdemeanor battery in 2015, and in two lawsuits in 2012 and 2014 had alleged law enforcement officials were harassing him and using counter-terrorism units to sleep-deprive him.
0151.00045; O'Leary could not be reached for comment. He did not respond to emails or calls seeking an interview at multiple numbers listed for him.
0151.00046; A relative declined to help Reuters get in touch with him.
0151.00047; Butman, the sales rep, said she later quit her job at MyDNACancerTesting. MedMolecular, the other company, later shut down its genetic testing business. Butman has since gone back to those from whom she collected cheek swabs to warn them the billings for the tests might be improper.
0151.00048; She said she has filed complaints with several state attorneys general against MyDNACancerTesting and some of the labs she fears were overbilling.
0151.00049; I feel like a victim, said Butman, who said she got involved to help those at risk of cancer.
0151.00050; Jerry Pfeister, the founder of MyDNACancerTesting, told Reuters he contracted with a different company which dealt with the labs, but his company did not interact with labs or doctors.
0151.00051; He said MyDNACancerTesting severed ties and stopped collecting cheek swabs for the company that dealt with the labs in April. We never had any interactions with any doctors or labs, Pfeister said.
0151.00052; Monique Deckter, formerly vice president of operations at the other company, MedMolecular, said her small marketing firm contracted with a larger distributor that helped facilitate the tests, which were later shipped to Spectrum Diagnostic.
0151.00053; She said she closed MedMolecular in April 2019 amid concerns the telemedicine company she was told to use was not strictly following Medicare rules. Justo Méndez, an attorney for Spectrum Diagnostic Labs, said every sample it receives comes with a medical order signed by a doctor and a patient consent form. Spectrum has processes in place to ensure compliance with the required documentation needed from the referring physician, he said.
0151.00054; The amounts billed are handled by a third party, he said, and the company has no financial relationships with doctors.
0151.00055; Perry Holloway, a company principal, said he was unaware of any problems.
0151.00056; His attorney Samy Khalil said his client did not know of or intentionally participate in any fraud.
0151.00057; In a common trend nationwide, sales reps were enticed by some marketing firms through ads on recruitment websites, with the promise they could earn from anywhere from $200 to more than $1,000 for every swab collected and sent to the lab, said investigators and several sales reps interviewed by Reuters.
0151.00058; In some cases, investigators warn, such payments could be construed as a kickback.
0151.00059; Anti-kickback laws prohibit medical referrals in exchange for a reward or anything of value in connection with federal healthcare programs. In 2018, Congress doubled the maximum prison term in such cases to 10 years per offense.
0151.00060; A little-explored world surrounds the marketing companies, laboratories and telemedicine companies involved in elder genetic testing.
0151.00061; Among them is Spectrum.
0151.00062; Another is Clio Laboratories, the Georgia-based lab that is part of an interconnected network of labs, medical billing operations, a telemedicine firm and other healthcare-related limited liability companies, company records show.
0151.00063; Several patients said they filed complaints with state or federal agencies against Clio and Spectrum, either by phone or through written complaints seen by Reuters. In a handful of cases, the patients who had DNA samples sent to Clio or Spectrum said they never spoke with a doctor about why the cancer or pharmacogenetic tests were medically necessary.
0151.00064; Moreover, when test results were completed, they were mailed directly to patients' homes.
0151.00065; That is not the norm, say doctors and medical experts. Usually, the ordering physician receives results first, then reviews them with the patient.
0151.00066; Nemerson, the Clio lawyer, declined to comment on these specifics, citing her statement to Reuters that the company diligently follows testing rules.
0151.00067; Spectrum's lawyer said the company has not been contacted by the government concerning any patient complaints.
0151.00068; In 2017, the most recent data available, Clio billed Medicare $8.6 million for genetic testing and was paid about $4.6 million.
0151.00069; Clio Laboratories and a cluster of companies  -  including Elite Medical Laboratories, 360 Laboratories and billing company Laboratory Experts  -  are connected to Jordan Satary, an entrepreneur in his mid-twenties whose father once ran a lab that went bust, records show. His father, Khalid Ahmed Satary, had earlier founded and led Confirmatrix, a Georgia toxicology lab. Satary started that company after his April 2008 release from federal prison he had pleaded guilty to charges filed in 2003 involving fraud, trafficking in counterfeit products and copyright infringement related to a compact disc company he operated.
0151.00070; Confirmatrix was raided by federal investigators in 2016, media reports say, as part of a probe into a kickback scheme involving opioid pain clinic owners who were routing urine drug tests to toxicology labs. The lab was accused, but not charged, with being part of the scheme in a 2017 indictment filed in Tennessee.
0151.00071; The investigation is ongoing.
0151.00072; Confirmatrix filed for bankruptcy November 4, 2016. Some of the former employees of the defunct company now work for multiple other labs with ties to the Satary family.
0151.00073; Elite Medical Laboratories, for instance, lists its lab director as Stanley Wu, the former Confirmatrix lab director.
0151.00074; Wu hung up on Reuters when it sought his comment and did not respond to an email seeking comment. Reuters journalists stopped by Elite's office last month. From outside the offices through large front windows, they saw UPS and FedEx boxes stacked inside, with cheek swabs and other DNA samples spilling out.
0151.00075; Two men stood at a table sorting them.
0151.00076; Elite has a long history of providing valuable services and is committed to upholding its legal obligations, Nemerson said in a statement. Khalid Satary did not respond to text messages or emails seeking comment.
0151.00077; An attorney who previously represented Satary told Reuters he could not comment.
0151.00078; Son Jordan is listed in an April 2019 document as the CEO and CFO of a medical billing operation, GNOS Medical, which is located in the same business plaza with Elite and Clio. It has since changed its name to Laboratory Experts, public records show.
0151.00079; Jordan Satary lists Laboratory Experts as belonging to him on his own corporate website. He was separately listed in 2018 as a registered agent for Clio's Florida-based location, which later merged with the Georgia office.
0151.00080; The contact information on the website for Elite Medical Labs contained an email address as recently as August for his media company, Shufe Media.
0151.00081; The reference was later removed, after Reuters inquiries.
0151.00082; Jordan Satary could not be reached for comment.
0151.00083; When a reporter stopped by Clio Laboratories in August, the office said he was out of town and referred Reuters to Nemerson, the company's general counsel. He did not respond to subsequent emails listed for his various companies, or to a text message.
0151.00084; Some of the doctors involved in the genetic testing wave also have checkered pasts.
0151.00085; One California doctor was signing off on genetic tests for patients even as two states had disciplined him or were preparing to do so after he was criminally convicted in Los Angeles.
0151.00086; Orthopedic surgeon Dr. Mitchell G. Cohen pleaded guilty in November 2015 to filing a false tax return in connection with an illegal kickback scheme, cooperated with the government's investigation, and later served more than eight months in a halfway house in central California through March 2019, court records show.
0151.00087; Cohen was not charged with making an illegal kickback, but pleaded guilty to making a false tax return in a case federal authorities said involved kickbacks.
0151.00088; New York and California each took disciplinary action based on the conviction, with both placing him on probation in June 2018 and June 2019, respectively. Cohen was approving genetic tests for Medicare patients during his stint in the halfway house and after his probation period ended. He approved the medical necessity of genetic tests handled by labs including BioConfirm in Georgia and Elite Medical Laboratories, lab records show.
0151.00089; He signed off on the genetic test for Elite in September 2018, as he was serving his sentence in the halfway house, records show.
0151.00090; He approved the medical necessity of tests sent to Bioconfirm on May 10, 2019.
0151.00091; Scott Grubman, an attorney for BioConfirm, said his client relies in good faith on the information submitted to it by the ordering provider, complies with its legal obligations and is not aware of any issues related to Dr. Cohen. Slideshow (6 Images)  Contacted by Reuters, Cohen said he was in surgery and hung up.
0151.00092; Mark Werksman, his attorney, said Cohen stopped working for several telemedicine companies authorizing genetic tests for Medicare patients on May 20, 2019, after the government suspended his Medicare billing privileges, an action that typically occurs after a doctor is convicted.
0151.00093; Under the probation terms, he said Cohen was allowed to work during the day while spending nights in the halfway house.
0151.00094; He said Cohen consulted with patients before the tests and followed up to discuss the results.
0151.00095; He believes he was providing a medically necessary and important service to his patients, Werksman said. Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

0153.00001; NewsLocal News  Alzheimer's drug now heads into 'phase two'  Posted: 5:47 PM, Sep 10, 2019  Updated: 2019-09-13 11:57:12-04  By: Eileen Buckley  BUFFALO, NY (WKBW)  -  One in ten is the number of Americans age 65 or older who have Alzheimer's disease.
0153.00002; It's a startling statistic.
0153.00003; But what if there was a treatment to stop this horrible disease in its tracks.
0153.00004; Researchers at the University of Buffalo may be one step closer to just that. Ying Xu is the co-lead investigator and research associate professor at UB's pharmacy school. She's an expert on research for this drug.
0153.00005; Eileen Buckley  Dean of UB's Pharmacy School James O'Donnell & Ying Xu, co-lead investigator & research associate professor.
0153.00006; The work in the UB lab was the center of research for an Alzheimer's drug that is now heading into phase two of a clinical trial in Michigan.
0153.00007; The University collaborated with tetra therapeutics for phase one of researching a drug known as BPN.
0153.00008; It could protect against memory loss, nerve damage and other symptoms of Alzheimer's. Dean of UB's Pharmacy School James O'Donnell says Tetra came along with an inhibitor that works well with their drug, leading to phase two clinical trials that will be conducted on people. This drug and drugs like it target that particular compound and so on a theoretical basis  -  it should enhance memory, so test will be whether human situation it does, remarked O'Donnell.
0153.00009; In the past, big name drug companies, such as Pfizer, failed at trials due to side effects.
0153.00010; But this discovery, in phase one at UB, ended side effects of such as nausea and vomiting. Eileen Buckley  Inside UB's Pharmacy School resdearch lab. The truth is people have been working on this class of drugs for a long time and it's been difficult separating out the therapeutic effects from the side effects, O'Donnell explained.
0153.00011; Anytime that we hear of a trial going to one phase to another - we are the biggest cheering section for those opportunities, declared Tricia Hughes, Alzheimer's Association of Western New York.
0153.00012; Getting a drug to phase two is a major leap and this comes at a crucial time as advocates fight in Washington, D.C. this week for $2.3 billion dollars in research funding.
0153.00013; Alzheimer's will bankrupt Medicare and Medicaid that's how expensive this disease is, so it's more of a problem of the awareness getting out there about those facts. $290 billion is spent just on Alzheimer's care alone, explained Lauren Ashburn, Alzheimer's Association of WNY.
0153.00014; Eileen Buckley  Lauren Ashburn & Tricia Hughes IF Alzheimer's Association of WNY, share a high-five as they discussed future clinical trials and work to fund Alzheimer's research.
0153.00015; The organization is also fighting for the Bold Infrastructure For Alzheimer's Act.
0153.00016; Hughes and Ashburn said this is a public health approach to the disease.
0153.00017; It will focus on prevention and early detection.
0153.00018; Hughes noted they are behind the eight ball on research.
0153.00019; But she said it is often difficult to get people across the nation to participate in clinical trials.
0153.00020; But if I don't have people to actually participate in the trials then the trial falls.
0153.00021; Because I have no one to participate, Hughes said.
0153.00022; The Association says there is also a big focus on women and women of color where there are higher rates of Alzheimer's.
0153.00023; If this drug makes it past phase two it could lead to larger phase 3 trials and the last hurdle before drug approval.
0153.00024; Back at UB's lab associate professor Xu also explained that even though the trials will take place in Michigan, the University will still be working on more research.
0153.00025; We are also testing if this drug has an effect on like mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, autism  -  like behaviors.
0153.00026; This is our own ongoing study, Xu noted.

0161.00001; Peter Wuffli, the former CEO of Switzerland's largest bank UBS and director at Swiss crypto bank Sygnum, wants to tap the $220 billion market of institutions and private individuals who already own cryptocurrencies. Local news outlet SwissInfo reported on Sept. 26 that Wuffli has shown excitement concerning the potential of crypto assets.
0161.00002; In an interview, he told the outlet:  The most immediate opportunity is the existing $220 billion market of institutions and private individuals who already own cryptocurrencies. Thousands of clients have contacted us for a one-stop-shop for asset custody, loans and trading cryptocurrencies seamlessly with fiat currencies.
0161.00003; Wuffli noted that he believes the tokenization of assets such as company shares, real estate, art or commodities is the next frontier in the industry.
0161.00004; However, he also admits that there are still many unanswered questions, and many of them are regulatory in nature.
0161.00005; Wuffli also praised the potential of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), pointing out the opportunity he sees in securitizing shares and building smart contract-based share registers.
0161.00006; He foresees such a system providing a great deal of simplification:  You can do away with spreadsheets and combining systems to pay dividends, do capital increases and trade on the secondary market.
0161.00007; And trading could take place without long settlement times and counterparty risk.
0161.00008; Yes to DLT, no to corporate currencies Still, he claimed that  -  on a deeper, philosophical level  -  DLT is about market democratization.
0161.00009; He said that he believes that the longer-term potential is to create a more open, broader and easier cross-border access to assets. Still, he also voiced a skeptical stance towards Facebook's Libra stablecoin. While Wuffli admitted that he does not know about Facebook's plans in detail and that he cannot really comment on the project, he voiced concern over the idea of corporate currencies in general.
0161.00010; He adds that nation-states will not allow such assets to threaten their monopoly on currencies, saying:  However, I do believe that the regulation of financial services and control over currencies are essential tasks of the state and that currencies cannot be decoupled from sovereign states.
0161.00011; As soon as someone tries to challenge the sovereign monopoly on currencies they will not allow it, and for good reason.
0161.00012; Besides, I don't think people will treat private currencies like that without the power of a country and a political system behind it.
0161.00013; As Cointelegraph reported in August, Sygnum received a banking and securities dealer license alongside Swiss crypto-specialized entity SEBA.
0161.00014; Wuffli noted:  One thing missing from my CV is that I have never been involved in the creation of a new bank.
0161.00015; I am a curious person and I love new things, it's energizing.

0166.00001; Gold Standard Ventures: Digging Into The Valuation After The Pre-Feasibility Study |  About: Gold Standard Ventures Corp (GSV)  by: Taylor Dart  Taylor Dart  Long/short equity, momentum, gold & precious metals  Summary  Gold Standard Ventures released its Pre-Feasibility Study last week, with an after-tax NPV (5%) of $241.5 million.
0166.00002; While the economics in the study are decent at $1,400/oz, the P/NAV for the stock is sitting at over 1.0x at the current share price.
0166.00003; Gold Standard Ventures (NYSEMKT:GSV) released its much-awaited Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) last week, and the economics of the project were mostly positive.
0166.00004; The study envisions annual gold placement of over 150,000 ounces over the mine life at all-in sustaining cash costs of below $700/oz. While these metrics are impressive, the after-tax NPV (5%) of $241.5 million is a little underwhelming compared to the stock's current valuation.
0166.00005; It's important to note that the study is done using only 40% of the existing resources, and economics can undoubtedly be improved in the future, given the company's exploration upside.
0166.00006; However, any junior trading at a P/NAV of over 1.05x is not cheap regardless of its jurisdiction.
0166.00007; The majority of open-pit resource peers trade at a P/NAV of less than 0.60x and have similar resources to that of Gold Standard. For this reason, while the stock likely has a solid floor under it after the study, I strongly disagree with another analyst's argument that the company is worth over $2.00 per share.
0166.00008; Gold Standard Ventures was a favorite of mine in 2016 at $1.50 per share, but I exited the stock in Q2 2017 for a small gain after the technical picture broke down. Since that time, the share price has lost more than 70% of its value, and the brief stint at a $700 million valuation is a distant memory.
0166.00009; The company's fundamentals have undoubtedly improved since this time, but the $700 million valuation came on the back of drill holes DS-16-08 and DS-16-24 which suggested that the Dark Star zone might be a high-grade open-pit resource.
0166.00010; Drill results since that time have been impressive, but not world-class, and the current Dark Star resource is 1.10 grams per tonne gold. For this reason, I believe that there's no reason that shareholders should expect a return to this $3.00 level as the stock didn't belong there in the first place.
0166.00011; While Goldcorp (NYSE:GG) purchased some of its position above this level, I believe it significantly overpaid, as it did for Kaminak at the height of the 2016 bull market. (Source: TradingView.com)  Now that I've given some background on Gold Standard Ventures and why I exited the stock, let's take a look at the current picture both technically and fundamentally.
0166.00012; An article last year on Gold Standard Ventures titled Gold Standard Ventures Overvalued?
0166.00013; Not So Fast in Q4 of last year discussed how the stock was likely to return to the $2.00+ level in 2019.
0166.00014; I'm afraid I have to disagree with this statement and would be shocked if the company traded above $2.00 in the next 12 months based on its current share structure.
0166.00015; Based on the current share structure of 278 million shares, the company would have a valuation of $556 million at a share price above $2.00.
0166.00016; This is a steep valuation for a company with an after-tax NPV (5%) of $241.5 million, even if this study uses only 40% of the company's resources.
0166.00017; Many juniors have studies in place using less than half of their current resource base and have a difficult time sustaining a valuation above a 0.60 P/NAV.
0166.00018; At a share price of $0.92, Gold Standard Ventures' current valuation is 1.06x P/NAV. (Source: Author's Table)  When stacking Gold Standard up against Marathon Gold (OTCQX:MGDPF), another open-pit explorer in North America, Gold Standard Ventures' P/NAV is more than triple that of Marathon's. Marathon Gold's current P/NAV is 0.28x, while Gold Standard Ventures is 1.06x.
0166.00019; Both companies have similar deposits with 3.5 million ounces of gold or more, and both companies have similar all-in sustaining costs (AISC) estimated from their studies at $666/oz for Marathon Gold, and $657/oz for Gold Standard Ventures.
0166.00020; Marathon's PEA, this premium still leaves a large discrepancy between the two valuations.
0166.00021; Even on an enterprise value per ounce basis, Marathon Gold's ounces are valued at $34.76/oz US, while Gold Standard is valued at $69.43/oz.
0166.00022; Every deposit is different, and it's impossible to expect all juniors to trade at the same metrics, but my research has shown that juniors are rarely acquired for over a 0.6x P/NAV. The only exceptions I've seen over the past eight years are Fronteer Gold, Ventana Gold, and Andean Resources. The only one of these that made sense was Fronteer Gold as that was arguably the most impressive open-pit deposit uncovered in the past decade from a grade and jurisdiction standpoint.
0166.00023; I do not believe either Marathon or Gold Standard deserves the premium that Fronteer Gold received from Newmont (NEM).
0166.00024; (Source: Mining.com)  The other recent acquisition done well above the 0.6x~ P/NAV average was Kaminak Gold by Goldcorp (NEM) in May 2016, and this deal was done at 1.14x P/NAV for the $406 million US takeover price. I believe that Goldcorp overpaid as it has a habit of it, as it did with Andean Resources in 2010 for $3.4 billion near the peak of that gold market as well.
0166.00025; The analyst arguing for a $2 handle on Gold Standard's argument stems from the fact that Kaminak received a hefty price tag for its Coffee Project.
0166.00026; However, I do not believe Kaminak should be used as a benchmark as it is nowhere near the average.
0166.00027; The average paid for juniors is $62.14/oz over the past six years, and the average junior, when acquired, had 4.2 million ounces of resources (across all categories). To use a massive deviation from this average like Kaminak and consider it the benchmark is wild speculation, in my opinion.
0166.00028; However, even if we do entertain the fact that Goldcorp didn't overpay for Kaminak and use the 1.14x P/NAV for Gold Standard Ventures, this gives us a share price of $1.00 for GSV.
0166.00029; This figure is nowhere near the $2.00 discussed in the November article.
0166.00030; Let's take a closer look at the Feasibility Study:  (Source: Company News Release)  Looking at Gold Standard's Pre-Feasibility Study above, we can see that the project envisions average annual placement of 156,000 ounces over the eight-year mine life at all-in sustaining costs of $657/oz. This is a significant amount of annual production, and the AISC would place the company in the top 20% of companies from a cost standpoint.
0166.00031; Well below the average all-in sustaining costs of mid-tier producers of $895/oz. The project has a very reasonable initial Capex of $194 million, and this includes a 15% contingency.
0166.00032; When compared to most other development stage juniors, this initial Capex is on the low side and does not present much of a hurdle to moving into production.
0166.00033; Finally, the strip ratio is quite impressive at 3.1 to 1 and is more impressive than most other open-pit juniors currently in the development stage.
0166.00034; (Source: Company Presentation)  To summarize, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this Pre-Feasibility Study.
0166.00035; The project has modest initial Capex, exceptional all-in sustaining cash costs, and reasonable average annual gold placement of over 150,000 ounces.
0166.00036; The issue with Gold Standard Ventures is not in its current study it's in the valuation that is close to fairly valued after heavy dilution since mid-2017.
0166.00037; The Battle Mountain Gold acquisition added nearly 20% to the share count as it was completed for 0.19 per GSV share, and financings have been at successively lower prices since.
0166.00038; As we can see from the below chart of financings in Canadian dollars, the trend is down for financing prices.
0166.00039; In 2016 it was raised at over $3.00 per share, in 2018 at $2.05 per share, and the most recent financing was completed at $1.22. (Source: Author's Chart)  So what is the fair valuation for Gold Standard Ventures?
0166.00040; In my opinion, Gold Standard Ventures does deserve a 35% premium vs. the average enterprise value per ounce for juniors of $62/oz~.
0166.00041; I also believe the project deserves a significant premium on a P/NAV standpoint to development juniors, and a P/NAV of 1.00~ is not unreasonable for the project. The reason for this is simple. The company has the best real estate in the world for mining and has assembled the most abundant land package not owned by a major on the Carlin Trend.
0166.00042; If we apply these premiums to Gold Standard Ventures, the company is fairly valued on a P/NAV standpoint as it's currently trading at 1.06x.
0166.00043; Using an enterprise value per ounce metric, the company's 3.5 million ounces should command an enterprise value of $292.95 million, or a share price of $1.12 US. This leaves the company about 20% undervalued here.
0166.00044; (Source: Company Presentation)  (Source: TC2000.com)  In conclusion, I believe the recent Pre-Feasibility Study done by Gold Standard Ventures has put a floor under the stock at key weekly support at $0.84.
0166.00045; However, I disagree entirely with the fact that the company deserves to trade at a $560 million valuation currently, where it would be valued above $2.00 per share as another analyst suggests.
0166.00046; If Gold Standard could make additional discoveries and push itself over the 5-million ounce mark based on further exploration, I would be willing to entertain a $2.00 share price.
0166.00047; However, as we stand with 3.4 million ounces and an after-tax NPV (5%) of $241.5 million, I see the stock as only slightly undervalued.
0166.00048; Anything is possible in the market, and figuring out fair valuation has its limitations as short-term, stock markets are voting machines. However, I see better opportunities out there from a valuation standpoint in the junior space. There is no disputing that Gold Standard Ventures has released an impressive PFS, but the valuation is the minor issue.
0166.00049; Disclosure: I am/we are long MGDPF.
0166.00050; I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

0168.00001; News / National  by Staff reporter  10 hrs ago | Views  LINE ministries are said to be breaking regulations under the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA), which compel them to submit monthly and quarterly financial statements and reports to appropriate parliamentary portfolio committees for oversight and monitoring of use of public resources.
0168.00002; This was revealed in a recent report by the Parliament Budget Office, which exposed that generally compliance levels by ministries were unsatisfactory and blasted the poorly structured content in the reports. The Parliament Budget Office named the defaulting line ministries.
0168.00003; The issue also comes amid revelations last week, during the sitting of the Tendai Biti-led Public Accounts Committee (PAC), that the Finance minstry and the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe have been breaching the law through excessive borrowing to finance government's budget deficit.
0168.00004; Government has been financing its deficit through borrowing from the central bank, while going over the RBZ Act statutory limit.
0168.00005; The Act stipulates that borrowing from the central bank should not exceed 20% of the previous year's revenues.
0168.00006; But as of December 2018, total lending by the bank to the government was more than $3 billion, representing 75% of 2017 revenues.
0168.00007; The-PFMA compels every accounting officer to submit monthly and quarterly financial statements and report to appropriate parliamentary portfolio committees, and the idea behind these provisions is for Parliament to monitor use of public resources in line with its financial oversight functions, the Parliament Audit Office report said.
0168.00008; Generally, compliance level remains unsatisfactory as we (Parliament) target 100% compliance, and an assessment of the submitted reports revealed some inconsistencies and lack of requisite information as ministries are submitting reports that are financial in nature but lacking detailed explanations on activities, outputs and progress on implementation of planned activities.
0168.00009; The ministries fingered as having zero submission of reports are the Justice Health Foreign Affairs Transport Lands Energy and Power Development Higher Education and Sport, Arts and Recreation. The ministries said to be 100% compliant include Finance, Industry and Commerce, Mines, Defence and War Veterans, and Media, Information and Broadcasting Services.
0168.00010; The rest of the ministries were said to be sometimes compliant. In the 2018 financial year, only five complied with quarterly submission requirements and nine consistently submitted the monthly reports.
0168.00011; The compliance level increased in the first half of 2019 with 13 ministries having submitted the first quarter reports representing 55% increase in the compliance level. Parliament said the major challenge was the content and structure of the reports by ministries, which lacked detailed information sufficient to track the implementation of policies and programmes by government.

0171.00001; Article | Dealerships  2019-09-16T19:31:57+00:00 Rex Collins, CPA, CVARex Collins, CPA, CVA  On Friday, September 13, 2019 the IRS issued proposed regulations that clarify bonus depreciation and interest expense for dealerships with floor plan financing.
0171.00002; To the extent that overall interest expense, including floorplan interest, is below 30% of adjusted taxable income, a dealership will be eligible to take 100% bonus depreciation.
0171.00003; Further, eligibility to take bonus depreciation is determined on an annual basis.
0171.00004; Therefore, even if a dealership has to use the floor plan exception one year in order to deduct all of its interest expense (thereby losing the ability to take bonus depreciation in that year), it may still be eligible to take bonus depreciation in subsequent years if overall interest expense falls below 30% of adjusted taxable income in that given year.
0171.00005; This is great news for dealers who may have thought that bonus depreciation was lost forever.
0171.00006; When issued, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ushered in the most comprehensive and sweeping tax reform since The Tax Reform Act of 1986. Among the many changes that resulted was an interest expense limitation equal to 30% of adjusted taxable income.
0171.00007; Another notable outcome was the increase to bonus depreciation.
0171.00008; Prior to the 2017 act, bonus depreciation was to drop to 40% of the cost basis of the asset.
0171.00009; The 2017 act increased the rate to 100% for assets placed in service from September 27, 2017 to December 31, 2022.
0171.00010; What was the impact of these changes on dealerships?
0171.00011; Rex Collins, HBK CPAs & Consultants (HBK) Dealership Industry Group Principal, had an audience with the House Ways and Means Committee during the development of the bill proposals. As a result of his testimony, the House version of the bill included language that allowed dealerships with floor plan financing to deduct all floor plan related interest expense, even if that expense ultimately exceeded 30% of adjusted taxable income. However, dealerships would also not be able to benefit from 100% bonus expensing.
0171.00012; Originally, the law as passed was interpreted as allowing a full deduction of floor plan interest while excluding a dealership from 100% bonus depreciation.
0171.00013; Subsequently, the Joint Committee on Taxation issued a Blue Book interpretation of the interaction between floor plan interest expense and bonus depreciation that was much more favorable to dealerships.
0171.00014; Essentially, it suggested that if interest expense including floor plan interest was less than 30% of adjusted taxable income, the dealership may be eligible for bonus depreciation expensing. However, the interpretation also held that once a dealership used the floor plan exception, the dealership would not be eligible to use bonus depreciation in subsequent years.
0171.00015; Friday's announcement by the IRS of the new final and proposed regulations clarifies the conflicting language in the act and the Blue Book interpretation and is welcomed good news for dealers with floor plan financing.
0171.00016; Contact the HBK Dealership Industry Group today to discuss planning opportunities related to bonus depreciation as well as many other items that impact your dealership.

0174.00014; John McConnell  Thank you, Sonya.
0174.00015; Welcome and thank you all for joining us for our first quarter earnings call.
0174.00016; This quarter certainly had a lot of noise in it.
0174.00017; So let's get right to it.
0174.00018; I'll turn the call over to Mr. Hayek to start reviewing the numbers.
0174.00019; Joseph Hayek  Thanks John.
0174.00020; Good afternoon, everybody.
0174.00021; In Q1 we reported a loss of $0.09 a share versus earnings of $0.91 a share last year.
0174.00022; There were several unique items in the quarter, including the following pre-tax restructuring and impairment charges of $45 million primarily related to our engineered cabs business and our decision to write-down the 10% investment we have in our steel joint venture in China.
0174.00023; The prior quarter included impairment charges of $1.4 million or a $0.01 share.
0174.00024; As we mentioned in our press release this morning, we are actively exploring our strategic alternatives for the cab business, including but not limited to the possible sales of majority interest.
0174.00025; Our estimated inventory holding losses were $8.4 million or $0.11 per share in the quarter compared to a gain of $14 million or $0.17 per share in the prior year quarter.
0174.00026; We incurred a pre-tax charge of $4 million or $0.06 per share related to the early extinguishment of our 2020 6.5% public bonds, which we refinanced in August using cash on hand and an issuance of longer-term Euro denominated debt with an average interest rate of 1.76%.
0174.00027; In our cylinder business we recognized a pre-tax profit of $12.8 million or $0.17 per share related to the early termination of the customer take-or-pay contract, which effectively pulled some future earnings into the current quarter.
0174.00028; Consolidated net sales decreased by 13% to $856 million in Q1 from the prior year quarter, due to lower direct shipments and lower average selling prices in steel processing.
0174.00029; In addition to declining steel prices which impact our revenues and demand, many of our markets are seeing very little or no growth, and we believe economic conditions, trade wars, tariffs and uncertainty have impacted behaviors both in the U.S. and in Europe.
0174.00030; Our gross profit declined in the quarter by $26 million from Q1 of last year to $117 million, primarily driven by the $22 million unfavorable swing in pre-tax inventory holding losses, and lower direct volumes of steel partially offset by improvements in cylinders and the pull forward of the margin dollars related to that cancelled take-or-pay contract.
0174.00031; Total ship tons were down 9.3%, with direct shipments down 15.4% and total declining 1% from last year's record first quarter.
0174.00032; Direct tons were 54% of mix compared to 58% in the prior year quarter.
0174.00033; As we discussed on previous calls, we believe that last year, customers were building inventories due to rising steel prices, which peaked in July.
0174.00034; While this year customers have been destocking to reduce and maintain low inventory levels with the recent low point in steel prices occurring in July of 2019.
0174.00035; Now we believe year-over-year destocking is beginning to moderate. We did continue to see some softness in Q1 automotive volumes due to reduced North American auto builds year-over-year and we saw weakness in agricultural end markets.
0174.00036; Operating income for steel processing of $6 million was down $33 million from Q1 last year, driven by the negative swing of approximately $22 million in inventory holding gains or losses combined with lower direct volumes.
0174.00037; Due to continuing decline in steel prices, we do expect inventory holding losses will continue into Q2 of 2020.
0174.00038; That said, we also believe that our steel processing team is managing that business very well in a difficult environment and is maintaining and in certain markets increasing the market share, while remaining focused on long-term growth and profitability.
0174.00039; Turning to pressure cylinders, net sales were $304 million up 1% over the prior year quarter.
0174.00040; Operating Income of $30 million was up $15 million from Q1 of last year, excluding the $12.8 million benefit related to the take-or-pay contract within our industrial products business and impairment charges in the prior year, cylinder operating income was up 4% year-over-year due primarily to improvements in the oil and gas business and in the industrial products business.
0174.00041; Cylinder end market conditions in the U.S. were stable, our operations in Europe continued to face headwinds due to the economic conditions in those geographies.
0174.00042; In Engineered Cabs, net sales were up 3% over Q1 of last year driven by a favorable product mix.
0174.00043; Cabs reported operating loss before restructuring of $4.5 million was $200,000 worse than the prior year quarter.
0174.00044; As we mentioned earlier, we are actively exploring our strategic alternatives for this business and we recognize pre-tax restructuring and impairment charges of $41 million in the quarter.
0174.00045; Our cabs business has continued to make improvements and assist in itself very well for the future. But we feel that undertaking this evaluation of alternatives is the right thing to do for both the business and for our shareholders.
0174.00046; Turning to our JVs, equity income during the quarter was $25 million, down $5 million from the prior year quarter, $4 million of that decrease was due to a charge associated with our decision to write down our 10% investment in our steel joint venture in China.
0174.00047; Our equity income from WAVE increased by $1.9 million, Serviacero was down $2.9 million primarily due to inventory holding losses.
0174.00048; We received $30 million in dividends from our unconsolidated JVs during the quarter.
0174.00049; Turning to the cash flow statement and the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $64 million in the quarter.
0174.00050; We received $9 million of proceeds from asset sales primarily related to the divestiture of our cryogenics business in Turkey.
0174.00051; We invested $22 million on capital projects, reduced our debt by $50 million and we paid $13 million in dividends and $30 million to be purchased 750,000 shares of our stock.
0174.00052; Today the board declared a $0.24 per share dividend for the quarter payable in December of 2019. I'll close with the balance sheet.
0174.00053; Funded debt at quarter-end was down $50 million sequentially to $699 million, our interest expense of $9 million was down slightly from the prior year quarter.
0174.00054; As we mentioned earlier, during the quarter we called our $150 million 6.5% coupon bonds that were due in April 2020.
0174.00055; We incurred a pre-tax charge of $4 million to call the bond, we were very pleased to be able to refinance them using cash on hand and issuing roughly $100 million of long-term Euro denominated notes, maturing in 2029, 2031 and 2034 with an average interest rate of 1.76%.
0174.00056; Based on current debt levels this refinancing should reduce our future interest expense run rate by approximately $2 million per quarter.
0174.00057; We ended the quarter with consolidated cash of $46 million and $548 million available under our revolving credit facilities.
0174.00058; Our adjusted EBITDA over the last 12 months, which includes $13 million charged for the tank replacement program was $302 million and our net debt to trailing EBITDA leverage ratio is roughly two times.
0174.00059; At this point, I'll turn it over to Andy.
0174.00060; Andy Rose  Thank you, Joe.
0174.00061; Good afternoon, everyone.
0174.00062; Well, our first quarter had some challenges primarily driven by continued steel price volatility and tariffs.
0174.00063; We accomplished a lot during the quarter and are positioning ourselves well for the balance of the year. Our recent focus has been on cleaning up underperforming and non-core assets. During the last several months, we extended our alternative fuels business in Turkey and wrote-off the value of our strip steel joint venture in China.
0174.00064; We've also been engaged in a review of strategic alternatives regarding our engineered cabs business, and hope to have additional information in the coming months regarding our path forward.
0174.00065; Our goal remains that all of our businesses achieve year-over-year growth in EBITDA and return our cost of capital.
0174.00066; And as we manage our portfolio into the future, our goal is to raise our overall cash return on investment.
0174.00067; In the meantime, our cash flow remained solid, we're using that cash to reward shareholders in other ways.
0174.00068; We refinanced long-term debt using some of that cash and will save almost $8 million per year in interest costs at current debt levels.
0174.00069; We continue to see value in our shares and repurchased 750,000 shares during the quarter.
0174.00070; And while we did not complete any acquisitions, we've seen some increased activity around our core that is encouraging. A lot has changed in the past year at Worthington, with new leadership in many of our businesses and a renewed commitment to driving shareholder value.
0174.00071; This is not an industry, there is not an industry in America that is not being disrupted in some manner right now.
0174.00072; And ours is no different, whether it's electric vehicles, cloud-based data analytics, or robotics, all of these forces are accelerating change around us. Change creates opportunity.
0174.00073; And we expect to be leading this change not watching it pass us by.
0174.00074; We have a talented group of leaders charting our course and an excellent workforce that is the key ingredient to delivering success.
0174.00075; Thanks for your continued support of  Worthington.
0174.00076; John? John McConnell  Andy, thank you, good job. Chris, you can take any questions that you may have.
0174.00077; Question-and-Answer Session  Operator  [Operator Instructions] And first we will go to line of Martin Englert with Jefferies.
0174.00078; Please go ahead.
0174.00079; Martin Englert  So within steel processing, even when adjusting for the inventory holding loss, the operating profits per ton seem quite low.
0174.00080; Can you talk about what's driving that? Exactly is that something to do with mix, there may be something else and then also touch on the magnitude of inventory holding losses in fiscal 2Q that you might be anticipating?
0174.00081; John McConnell  Sure, I will take the second one first, we do expect inventory holding losses in Q2, we think that they'll be two-thirds of what they were, this is like - it's a little early, but two-thirds what they were in Q1.
0174.00082; And with respect to steel processing generally getting outside of FIFO volume is a significant contributor there.
0174.00083; We had - we were down in direct tons 88 tons year-over-year, for the quarter.
0174.00084; And so our margins have actually hung in there pretty well.
0174.00085; But when you have lower volumes like that, especially year-over-year, you have some challenges. We also had a couple of two or three week outages that were planned, that were very necessary and beneficial for our facilities to do some maintenance and do some things like that, but as you know when you have an outage like that, that's planned to build inventory ahead of that in a declining steel price environment like the one that we had, ultimately that hurt us a bit on the P&L side as well.
0174.00086; Martin Englert  The FIFO inventory holding losses that you called out for the quarter, that included the inventory build as well, or that would be exclusive of the implications there?
0174.00087; John McConnell  That is separate from that number.
0174.00088; Martin Englert  That is separate, any rough estimates on maybe what the headwinds would have been from the holding losses on the inventory build.
0174.00089; And then also anything else associated with the outage?
0174.00090; Martin Englert  Okay, so $4 million in outage expense, and then some other amount of inventory holding losses above and beyond the $8 million that you called out from also associated with the outage?
0174.00091; John McConnell  No, no, no - the outages really, is that number. Martin Englert  Okay.
0174.00092; John McConnell  But the losses were on top of that. Martin Englert  Okay, good outage.
0174.00093; Okay, and within cylinders, can you provide some more detail on the take-or-pay contract there that was cancelled, what happened, what was going on with that, and then also, what you're seeing regarding more recent demand trends with industrial and consumer products relative to where you are at a current quarter here, where things are trending today? John McConnell  Sure.
0174.00094; So with respect to the contract and bringing forward of those margin dollars, some of the nature of our business is that we do significant amount of engineering work, tooling work to spool up for long extended programs.
0174.00095; In this case, we were working with a very large Japanese OEM, on some hydrogen fuel cell oriented tanks, did a fair amount of work, we're set reserved factory capacity for the next 18 months because of some shifts that they had in platform.
0174.00096; And in demand, they decided not to move forward and has essentially terminated that contract.
0174.00097; As a consequence of that, we will receive the cash flows that would have been associated with us performing over that contract over the next five or six quarters. That's the amount that you see there, that would have been from a cash flow perspective span over five or six quarters because of an accounting requirements and the fact that we've agreed to that, we were compelled to recognize all of that in Q1. So effectively, what we are doing is bringing forward those margin dollars, we would have gotten for the next $5 or $6, where we recognize the cash that comes in, in this quarter.
0174.00098; We think that growth is moderate.
0174.00099; And we think we're doing a good job maintaining or growing our share.
0174.00100; We have seen some softness in Europe. We have facilities over there, and we have businesses in those geographies, our teams there are doing a terrific job in a pretty challenging environment.
0174.00101; Martin Englert  Can you remind us what your regional split is for that business between NAFTA and the Euro market and anything else there?
0174.00102; John McConnell  Sure, they are little bit but the European piece of cylinders business is usually between about 18% and 20% of the total. Andy Rose  And it's primarily industrial products.
0174.00103; Martin Englert  Okay.
0174.00104; Any specific industrial end markets that is more heavily weighted towards?
0174.00105; John McConnell  In Europe, it's still high pressure and LPG, primarily.
0174.00106; Martin Englert  Okay, thanks for all the detail. And if I could one last one.
0174.00107; Do you have a budgeted CapEx number for the year and anticipated tax rate?
0174.00108; John McConnell  Yes, probably $90 million to $100 million something like that would be a good estimate.
0174.00109; We get to $22 million in the first quarter. Operator  Next we will go to Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
0174.00110; Please go ahead.
0174.00111; Phi Gibbs  The corporate or other loss in the quarter, I think was around $5 million that had been zeroed out the last several quarters, anything that we should be thinking about there in terms of persistence or is that more of a one-time item related to some of the things that you're doing here?
0174.00112; Joseph Hayek  Yes, I would say it's probably more one-time. And it's a combination of a slight uptick in our overall healthcare costs, and then a large sort of one-time event.
0174.00113; We're self-insured.
0174.00114; And so that flows through that other line item.
0174.00115; And then there's also some lesser to the lesser extent there's some legal costs that are in there.
0174.00116; Phil Gibbs  So should I model something being modest or pretty much?
0174.00117; Joseph Hayek  For the future?
0174.00118; Phil Gibbs  Yes.
0174.00119; Joseph Hayek  Yes, I mean that line item should be relatively flat going forward. But we do get these sort of signal up ticks like the one we had here.
0174.00120; Phil Gibbs  I know you've had a lot of things moving around in WAVE the last call it 12 to 18 months.
0174.00121; And I think one of them was in allocation change with your partner and one of them was a sale of an international business.
0174.00122; So when I look at WAVE, $24 million of JV profit relative to $22 million last year.
0174.00123; Are those comps clean? Or do we have some variation in terms of what we're looking at because correct me if I'm wrong, Europe is not in the numbers now, but they were last year.
0174.00124; And I know that they may have not been all that accretive to you all.
0174.00125; So I'm just trying to understand the comparison.
0174.00126; Joseph Hayek  The way I would answer that one, Phil is it's a pretty clean number, the sale of Europe actually is expected to close next week, if you can believe that.
0174.00127; It's been ongoing because there is some regulatory issues but Europe was a very small percentage of WAVE's profit. So it really shouldn't affect our number much more than $0.25 million to $0.5 million every quarter or something like that.
0174.00128; John McConnell  Yes, but we've also backed that allocation change. Phil Gibbs  When the proceeds relative to that sale, have you realized those?
0174.00129; Are you still those on the comp?
0174.00130; Joseph Hayek  About two-thirds of them, we have realized the proceeds. We've actually been paid the full amount, but it's being held in escrow till the deal closes. Phil Gibbs  Okay, so that's on your, so that has been realized on your financial statements at this point?
0174.00131; Joseph Hayek  Except for the last portion of proceeds, which is not, not, it's less than $10 million.
0174.00132; Phil Gibbs  Okay.
0174.00133; And the growth that you saw in the profit in WAVE year-over-year, is that more related to volume or spread just trying to gauge the demand and the mix environment? Joseph Hayek  It's actually both here in the U.S., their volumes were up quarter-over-quarter and their spreads were up as well.
0174.00134; Phil Gibbs  Their volumes were up year-over-year you mean relative to WAVE, yes?
0174.00135; Joseph Hayek  Yes.
0174.00136; Phil Gibbs  And then last question for me is just assuming that we for simplicity take out, Engineered Cabs moving forward just out of the numbers, any estimate in terms of how much D&A is tied to the business?
0174.00137; Joseph Hayek  We'll get to that number rather quickly.
0174.00138; Phil Gibbs  Thank you.
0174.00139; John McConnell  Phil, you're talking about the depreciation and amortization within Engineered Cabs?
0174.00140; Phil Gibbs  Yes, so if you were to sell it or, wind it down, I mean, how much of depreciation is associated with that?
0174.00141; Joseph Hayek  We will work on that number.
0174.00142; Phil Gibbs  Okay, thank you.
0174.00143; John McConnell  Obviously, the majority of it's written off now, so there won't be any going forward.
0174.00144; But I know what you're trying to do.
0174.00145; You're not trying to figure out how much is coming out. Operator  Next we will go to John Tumazos, Very Independent Research.
0174.00146; Please go ahead.
0174.00147; John Tumazos  Thank you for that Euro denominated financing and all the good housecleaning, I think the Euro went down more in the last month and the interest rate you're going to pay?
0174.00148; John McConnell  Interesting times for sure.
0174.00149; John Tumazos  I was in Greece and I had some leftover Euros that got to be valued. So with the 92,000 ton fall on steel processing volume in the quarter, that's the tons that you took title to, what was the rate of change of total tons?
0174.00150; John McConnell  The direct ton is actually 88,000 tons.
0174.00151; And so that was the direct tons number, I'll make sure I don't give you the wrong one.
0174.00152; Direct tons declined little over 15%, toll is just 1%.
0174.00153; John Tumazos  So it was basically a switch from direct to toll?
0174.00154; John McConnell  You got it, the mix shifted.
0174.00155; John Tumazos  So it wasn't really a volume decline per se?
0174.00156; What do you think is the natural rate of growth of the steel processing business, the cylinder business and WAVE as they exist today for the top class?
0174.00157; John McConnell  We like to think of them as around GDP. And we're pretty there will be some markets that grow more rapidly than that within our businesses and with our end-markets, there will be some that grow slower than that.
0174.00158; But overall, we think of them as GDP over the mid-term.
0174.00159; And we're very comfortable operating in an environment like that because we think that the way that we go about our business through innovation, through lean manufacturing, through selected M&A will allow us to have lots and lots of opportunities to take share from those and ultimately longer term grow more rapidly than our markets do.
0174.00160; John Tumazos  The volumes fell a lot in the industrial cylinders double-digit, and around 5% in the consumer cylinders. Was there anything in particular that might explain that? John McConnell  Yes, that's a great question, we should have mentioned earlier, 90% of that decline is because of the divestitures.
0174.00161; If you recall at the end of the calendar year last year, we divested of our brazing and soldering operations.
0174.00162; That's the lion's share of that decline in volume.
0174.00163; John Tumazos  Thank you very much.
0174.00164; John McConnell  Certainly, thank you.
0174.00165; Joseph Hayek  To answer Phil's question on the amount of depreciation and amortization for Engineered Cabs, it's about $5.5 million per year.
0174.00166; Operator  [Operator Instructions] And then we do have a follow-up from Phil Gibbs.
0174.00167; Please go ahead. Philip Gibbs  Thank you.
0174.00168; So if I'm going to take the $12 plus million of last or future gross profit that you pulled into this quarter, given the take-or-pay, the hydrogen contract?
0174.00169; I would imagine revenue from that contract would have been a multiple of that over what you thought the life would have been.
0174.00170; So how do you replace moving forward? How do you replace that lost, lost business because it's a pretty big chunk and I know that's pretty specialized equipment that you're running, those materials on, just give us a flavor for that market?
0174.00171; Joseph Hayek  It's a very good question that is a business for us. So you illustrate the point, which is - we've got to go get there. And we're fully aware of that.
0174.00172; And our commercial teams and our engineering teams are out talking to lots of customers, that sometimes a good thing to have capacity in a market where the products that you have are desirable and with the world in different places moving in different directions in terms of the fuels that we use.
0174.00173; We feel pretty good about our ability to replace that not tomorrow but over the course of the next several months.
0174.00174; Philip Gibbs  And this is largely you're making this stuff in the U.S. or out of Europe? Joseph Hayek  It's first produced in the U.S., it might end up in a geography other than the U.S.  Operator  And we do have a follow-up from John Tumazos.
0174.00175; Please go ahead.
0174.00176; John Tumazos  With benchmarks for hot rolled, she's having fallen June last year 924 to about 525 June this year then bouncing up and eroding a little bit.
0174.00177; Can we assume that when November is over that $400 is roughly washed through your system and it's steady state? John McConnell  Yes, I mean assuming prices stay stable where they are, the answer is yes.
0174.00178; John Tumazos  Further, your cash balances close at $45.6 million at the end of August. When business goes to the tubes, you generate a little bit of cash, lower receivables and lower inventory values.
0174.00179; When business picks up, how much money do you think you'll put back into working capital? John McConnell  That's a relatively complex question because a lot of it depends on what steel prices do John in terms of how much, the actual tons of inventory we don't expect to change significantly but the price certainly can affect that.
0174.00180; But obviously, if business goes up 10%, then there's an equation there.
0174.00181; John Tumazos  Thank you.
0174.00182; I thought your guess would be better than mine.
0174.00183; Thank you.
0174.00184; John McConnell  Perfect, it's not an easy one to answer. Operator  And with no further questions in queue, I will turn it back to the company if you have any closing comments. John McConnell  Thank you all again for joining us with us reviewing the first quarter.
0174.00185; We look forward to talking to you at the end of the second. Thank you.
0174.00186; Operator  Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference.
0174.00187; Thank you for your participation.
0174.00188; You may now disconnect.
0175.00001; New FDI approval regime  Author: Shubham Mathur, HPNLU. Apart from being a critical driver of economic growth, foreign direct investment (FDI) is a major source of non-debt financial resource for the economic development of India.
0175.00002; Foreign companies invest in India to take advantage of relatively lower wages, special investment privileges such as tax exemptions, etc. For a country where foreign investments are being made, it also means achieving technical know-how and generating employment.
0175.00003; The Indian government's favourable policy regime and robust business environment have ensured that foreign capital keeps flowing into the country. The government has taken many initiatives in recent years such as relaxing FDI norms across sectors such as defence, PSU oil refineries, telecom, power exchanges, and stock exchanges, among others.
0175.00004; Market size  According to the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), FDI equity inflows in India in 2018-19 stood at US$ 44.37 billion, indicating that the government's effort to improve ease of doing business and relaxation in FDI norms is yielding results.
0175.00005; Data for 2018-19 indicates that the services sector attracted the highest FDI equity inflow of US$ 9.16 billion, followed by computer software and hardware  -  US$ 6.42 billion, trading  -  US$ 4.46 billion and telecommunications  -  US$ 2.67 billion.
0175.00006; Most recently, the total FDI equity inflows for the month of March 2019 touched US$ 3.60 billion.
0175.00007; During 2018-19, India received the maximum FDI equity inflows from Singapore (US$ 16.23 billion), followed by Mauritius (US$ 8.08 billion), Netherlands (US$ 3.87 billion), USA (US$ 3.14 billion), and Japan (US$ 2.97 billion). Investments/ developments  India emerged as the top recipient of greenfield FDI Inflows from the Commonwealth, as per a trade review released by The Commonwealth in 2018.
0175.00008; Some of the recent significant FDI announcements are as follows:  In October 2018, VMware, a leading software innovating enterprise of US has announced an investment of US$ 2 billion in India between 2023.
0175.00009; In August 2018, Bharti Airtel received approval of the Government of India for sale of a 20 percent stake in its DTH arm to an America based private equity firm, Warburg Pincus, for around $350 million. In June 2018, Idea's appeal for 100 percent FDI was approved by Department of Telecommunication (DoT) followed by its Indian merger with Vodafone making Vodafone Idea the largest telecom operator in India In May 2018, Walmart acquired a 77 percent stake in Flipkart for a consideration of US$ 16 billion.
0175.00010; In February 2018, Ikea announced its plans to invest up to Rs 4,000 crore (US$ 612 million) in the state of Maharashtra to set up multi-format stores and experience centers.
0175.00011; Kathmandu based conglomerate, CG Group is looking to invest Rs 1,000 crore (US$ 155.97 million) in India by 2020 in its food and beverage business, stated Mr. Varun Choudhary, Executive Director, CG Corp Global. International Finance Corporation (IFC), the investment arm of the World Bank Group, is planning to invest about US$ 6 billion through 2022 in several sustainable and renewable energy programs in India.
0175.00012; As of February 2019, the Government of India is working on a road map to achieve its goal of US$ 100 billion worth of FDI inflows. In February 2019, the Government of India released the Draft National e-Commerce Policy which encourages FDI in the marketplace model of e-commerce.
0175.00013; Further, it states that the FDI policy for the e-commerce sector has been developed to ensure a level playing field for all participants.
0175.00014; The government of India is planning to consider 100 percent FDI in Insurance intermediaries in India to give a boost to the sector and attracting more funds.
0175.00015; In December 2018, the Government of India revised FDI rules related to e-commerce.
0175.00016; As per the rules 100 percent, FDI is allowed in the marketplace based model of e-commerce.
0175.00017; Also, sales of any vendor through an e-commerce marketplace entity or its group companies have been limited to 25 percent of the total sales of such vendors.
0175.00018; In January 2018, the Government of India allowed foreign airlines to invest in Air India up to 49 percent with government approval. The investment cannot exceed 49 percent directly or indirectly.
0175.00019; No government approval will be required for FDI up to an extent of 100 percent in Real Estate Broking Services. In September 2017, the Government of India asked the states to focus on strengthening single-window clearance system for fast-tracking approval processes, in order to increase Japanese investments in India.
0175.00020; The Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India has eased the approval mechanism for foreign direct investment (FDI) proposals by doing away with the approval of the Department of Revenue and mandating clearance of all proposals requiring approval within 10 weeks after the receipt of application.
0175.00021; The Government of India is in talks with stakeholders to further ease foreign direct investment (FDI) in defence under the automatic route to 51 percent from the current 49 percent, in order to give a boost to the Make in India initiative and to generate employment.
0175.00022; In January 2018, the Government of India allowed 100 percent FDI in single-brand retail through automatic route.
0175.00023; India has become the most attractive emerging market for global partners (GP) investment for the coming 12 months, as per a recent market attractiveness survey conducted by Emerging Market Private Equity Association (EMPEA).
0175.00024; Annual FDI inflows in the country are expected to rise to US$ 75 billion over the next five years, as per a report by UBS.
0175.00025; The Government of India is aiming to achieve US$ 100 billion worth of FDI inflows in the next two years.
0175.00026; The World Bank has stated that private investments in India are expected to grow by 8.8 percent in FY 2018-19 to overtake private consumption growth of 7.4 percent, and thereby drive the growth in India's gross domestic product (GDP) in FY 2018-19.
0176.00001; Explainer: The Fed has a repo problem.
0176.00002; What's that? WallStreetReview  (Reuters)  -  As if the U.S. Federal Reserve didn't already have enough on its plate heading into its meeting on interest rates this week, chaos deep inside the plumbing of the U.S. financial system has thrown policymakers an unexpected curveball.
0176.00003; FILE PHOTO: Federal Reserve Board building on Constitution Avenue is pictured in Washington, U.S., March 19, 2019. REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo  Cash available to banks for their short-term funding needs all but dried up on Monday and Tuesday, and interest rates in U.S. money markets shot up to as high as 10% for some overnight loans, more than four times the Fed's rate. That forced the Fed to make an emergency injection of more than $50 billion, its first since the financial crisis more than a decade ago, to prevent borrowing costs from spiraling even higher.
0176.00004; It will conduct another one on Wednesday.
0176.00005; The exact cause of the squeeze is a matter of some debate, but most market participants agree that two coincidental events on Monday were at least partly to blame.
0176.00006; First, corporations had to withdraw funds from money market accounts to pay for quarterly tax bills, and then on the same day the banks and investors who bought the $78 billion of U.S. Treasury notes and bonds sold by Uncle Sam last week had to settle up. On top of that, the reserves that banks park with the Fed and are often made available to other banks on an overnight basis are at their lowest since 2011 thanks to the central bank's culling of its vast portfolio of bonds over the past few years.
0176.00007; Added together, these factors are testing the limits of the $2.2 trillion repurchase agreement  -  or repo  -  market, a gray but essential component of the U.S. financial system. Whatever the cause, the episode has added fuel to the argument that the Fed needs to take steps to avoid more disruptions in the repo market down the road.
0176.00008; (GRAPHIC  -  U.S. repo rate, here)  WHY IS THE REPO MARKET IMPORTANT? The repo market underpins much of the U.S. financial system, helping to ensure banks have the liquidity to meet their daily operational needs and maintain sufficient reserves.
0176.00009; In a repo trade, Wall Street firms and banks offer U.S. Treasuries and other high-quality securities as collateral to raise cash, often overnight, to finance their trading and lending activities.
0176.00010; The next day, borrowers repay their loans plus what is typically a nominal rate of interest and get their bonds back.
0176.00011; In other words, they repurchase, or repo, the bonds. The system typically hums along with the interest rate charged on repo deals hovering close to the Fed's benchmark overnight rate, currently set in a range of 2.00% to 2.25%.
0176.00012; That rate is expected to be cut by a quarter percentage point on Wednesday. But sometimes, investors get fearful of lending, as seen during the global credit crisis, or at other times there are just not enough reserves or cash in the system to lend out, as appeared to be the case this week. And that can cause a squeeze on the market and send borrowing costs zooming higher.
0176.00013; But when investors get fearful of lending, as seen during the global credit crisis, or when there are just not enough reserves or cash in the system to lend out, it sends the repo rate soaring above the Fed Funds rate. Trading in stocks and bonds can become difficult.
0176.00014; It can also pinch lending to businesses and consumers and, if the disruption is prolonged, it can become a drag on a U.S. economy that relies heavily on the flow of credit.
0176.00015; WHAT HAS CAUSED THE DROP IN BANK RESERVES? Coming out of the financial crisis, after the Fed cut interest rates to near zero and bought more than $3.5 trillion of bonds, banks built up massive reserves held at the Fed.
0176.00016; But that level of bank reserves, which peaked at nearly $2.8 trillion, began falling when the Fed started raising interest rates in late 2015.
0176.00017; They fell even faster when the Fed started to cut the size of its bond portfolio about two years later. The Fed stopped raising interest rates last year and cut them in July and is expected to do so again on Wednesday. It has also now ceased allowing to bonds to roll off its balance sheet.
0176.00018; The question vexing policymakers now is whether those actions are enough to stop the downward drift in reserves, which are a main source of liquidity in funding markets like repo.
0176.00019; Bank reserves at the Fed last stood at $1.47 trillion, the lowest level since 2011 and nearly 50% below their peak from five years ago.
0176.00020; (GRAPHIC  -  Bank excess reserves held at the Fed, here)  1. RUN SPOT REPO OPERATIONS Through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Fed can conduct occasional spot repo operations at times of funding stress, allowing banks and dealers to swap their Treasuries and other high-quality securities for cash at a minimal interest rate. It did this on Tuesday and will do it again on Wednesday.
0176.00021; 2. LOWER THE INTEREST IT PAYS ON EXCESS RESERVES By making it less profitable for banks, especially foreign ones, to leave their reserves at the Fed, it may encourage banks to lend to each other in money markets. 3. CREATE A STANDING REPO FACILITY Such a permanent financing program will allow eligible participants to exchange their bonds for cash at a set interest rate. Fed and its staff have considered such a facility, but they have not determined who qualifies, what would be the level of interest paid and the timing for a possible launch.
0176.00022; 4.
0176.00023; RAMP UP BUYING OF TREASURIES The Fed can replenish the level of bank reserves by slightly increasing its holdings of U.S. government debt.
0176.00024; This comes with the risk that it may be perceived as a resurrection of quantitative easing rather than a technical adjustment.

0180.00001; NASHVILLE, Tenn., Sept. 18, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Brookdale Senior Living Inc.
0180.00002; (NYSE: BKD) (Brookdale or the Company) today filed its definitive proxy statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and is mailing a letter to stockholders in connection with its 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the 2019 Annual Meeting).
0180.00003; Brookdale stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 9, 2019 will be entitled to vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting, which is scheduled for October 29, 2019. The Brookdale Board of Directors (the Board) unanimously recommends that stockholders vote on the WHITE proxy card FOR both of Brookdale's new, independent and highly qualified Class II director nominees, Victoria Freed and Guy Sansone. The two directors elected at the 2019 Annual Meeting will succeed the two retiring Class II directors, Jackie Clegg and James Seward.
0180.00004; In conjunction with the filing and mailing of its definitive proxy statement, Brookdale is mailing a letter to stockholders, which details the Company's:  Comprehensive and in-depth process for evaluating strategic alternatives that resulted in the determination to execute a strategic turnaround plan Improving operational and financial results under the new management team's leadership and execution and Significantly refreshed Board and corporate governance practices. The letter also outlines the reasons why the Brookdale Board believes that Land & Buildings' proposal for an OpCo/PropCo split of the Company's operations from its real estate would severely jeopardize Brookdale's current progress and damage the Company's long-term prospects at a time of great opportunity. The full text of the letter is below, and Brookdale's definitive proxy materials, letter to stockholders and other materials regarding the 2019 Annual Meeting can be found at the Company's investor relations webpage.
0180.00005; Dear Fellow Stockholder,  Thank you for your continued support of Brookdale Senior Living Inc.
0180.00006; We are writing to you at an important time  -  both in our history and the overall senior living industry.
0180.00007; We are writing to ask you to vote today on the enclosed WHITE proxy card FOR Brookdale's new, independent and highly qualified Class II director nominees:  Victoria Freed, Senior Vice President of Sales, Trade Support and Service, Royal Caribbean International.
0180.00008; Freed will bring to the Board decades of executive leadership in sales, customer service and marketing, as well as public company board experience in the hospitality industry, among other skills.
0180.00009; The Board believes that the addition of Ms. Freed's sales and marketing experience to the Board is crucial to support management's sales and marketing efforts in the turnaround strategy and to create long-term value for stockholders.
0180.00010; Guy Sansone, Managing Director and Chairman of the Healthcare Industry Group, Alvarez & Marsal. Mr. Sansone has extensive experience working with companies in the healthcare and senior housing industries, as well as experience in senior advisory and board leadership of public and private organizations.
0180.00011; Brookdale's recent financial results show that the Company's strategy to create value for stockholders is gaining momentum. However, one of our stockholders, Land & Buildings, has launched a proxy contest in an attempt to install Jay Flaherty, a former real estate executive, as a Class II director on the Brookdale Board at the upcoming 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
0180.00012; Brookdale has carefully considered and implemented feedback from its stockholders, including many of Land & Buildings' ideas.
0180.00013; In July 2017, at the recommendation of, and as part of a settlement agreement with Land & Buildings, Brookdale appointed Marcus Bromley, a candidate with substantial real estate experience, as an independent director and a member of both the Audit Committee and the Investment Committee of the Board.
0180.00014; Land & Buildings, led by founder and CIO Jonathan Litt, who until recently also sought election as a Class II director at the 2019 Annual Meeting, is advocating for a risky financial engineering plan that would ultimately result in isolating Brookdale's operating business from its critical real estate assets. The Board and the Investment Committee (which includes Mr. Bromley), in consultation with nationally recognized outside advisors (including advisors recommended by Land & Buildings), have carefully considered a range of potential sales or spin-offs of all or a substantial portion of the Company's real estate assets and have each unanimously determined that undertaking an OpCo/PropCo transaction would be unlikely to generate additional value for Brookdale's stockholders, as compared to the Company's ongoing execution of its strategic plan.
0180.00015; In reaching these conclusions, the Board and Investment Committee carefully evaluated a range of potential OpCo/PropCo separation structures, including the structure advocated by Land & Buildings.
0180.00016; -  BROOKDALE'S PLAN TO INCREASE STOCKHOLDER VALUE FOLLOWS AN IN-DEPTH STRATEGIC REVIEW  In February of 2018, the Board also concluded a 15-month review of strategic alternatives that included the exploration of multiple options and initiatives to create and enhance stockholder value.
0180.00017; At that time, the Board unanimously determined that the best path to enhancing value for our stockholders was to execute a disciplined turnaround plan under new leadership to significantly improve Brookdale's core operations.
0180.00018; The Company's long-term strategic plan is built around three top priorities:  Attract, engage, develop, and retain the best associates Earn trust and endorsements of our residents, patients, and their families by providing valued high-quality care and personalized service and Win Locally and leverage our scale effectively.
0180.00019; -  BROOKDALE'S STRATEGIC PLAN IS DELIVERING CLEAR RESULTS AND HAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM PROSPECTS  The efforts of Cindy Baier, our CEO since early 2018, and the enhanced management team, under the guidance of the Board led by Lee Wielansky as Non-Executive Chairman since early 2018, have translated into improved operational and financial results. Our most recent quarterly results further demonstrate that we are building positive momentum and our strategy is the right one to deliver sustained value creation for Brookdale's stockholders.
0180.00020; Our second quarter 2019 results demonstrate that our strategy is generating clear results.
0180.00021; For the first time since Q3 2017, same community move-ins showed positive year-over-year growth.
0180.00022; Growth turned positive a month earlier this year than in 2018 and two months earlier than in 2017. Year-over-year same community revenue grew in all Senior Housing segments, and Health Care Services revenue improved 4.2%. Same community Independent Living segment occupancy remained around 90% for the fourth consecutive quarter and grew 100 basis points year-to-date compared to the prior year.
0180.00023; Trailing 12-month key community leader retention is around 70%, while year-over-year total associate turnover improved by 5%.
0180.00024; This latest quarter also saw increased CapEx investment in our communities, which will improve Brookdale's long-term position by better attracting and retaining residents.
0180.00025; Since the first quarter of 2018, asset sales have generated over $230M of net proceeds.
0180.00026; Our enhanced operational and financial performance has significantly improved the Company's long-term prospects.
0180.00027; By executing our Win Locally strategy, we have better positioned Brookdale within both the senior housing and overall healthcare industries. Brookdale is now in a prime position to capitalize on national demographic tailwinds  -  notably the fast approaching silver wave of growing seniors' population  -  and we look forward to offering our exceptional care to an ever-growing base of American seniors.
0180.00028; Our long-term initiatives, focusing on optimizing our portfolio and streamlining the business, have proven successful thus far  -  -  we now own more than 50% of our consolidated communities.
0180.00029; We initiated a strategy in early 2018 to sell owned communities generating an aggregate of more than $250 million of proceeds, net of associated debt and transaction costs.
0180.00030; During the past two years we have restructured leases with our three largest landlords so that the Company may engage in certain change in control transactions without the need for landlord consent, provided that certain conditions are satisfied.
0180.00031; Since the first quarter of 2018, we reduced our community portfolio by 201 net communities, including 99 lease terminations, marking a 20% reduction in less than two years.
0180.00032; We have reduced our annual G&A cost base by more than $25 million in 2018 and more than $17 million in 2019 (prior to normal cost inflation and normalized bonus payouts). Since January 2018 and through June 2019, Brookdale has repurchased 3.5 million shares at an average price of $6.49 per share.
0180.00033; -  THE BROOKDALE BOARD HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY REFRESHED, AND WELCOMES AND VALUES IDEAS FROM ALL OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS  Since concluding our strategic review in early 2018, members of the Company's Board and management team have continued to engage in regular, in-depth discussions with our stockholders, including holding more than 30 telephonic, in-person or video meetings with Land & Buildings to understand the ideas it has continued to present.
0180.00034; As a result of our ongoing review of the Company's corporate governance structure and our ongoing engagement with stockholders, Brookdale has proactively taken a number of steps to improve the Company's corporate governance practices and to promote Board refreshment and ensure that we have the best people at the helm of our business.
0180.00035; We have worked alongside our stockholders to appoint multiple independent directors with a wealth of industry and corporate leadership experience:  Two of the current eight members of Brookdale's Board were added following recommendations from activist stockholders, including Land & Buildings.
0180.00036; Following the 2019 Annual Meeting, the Board's average tenure will be less than three years, with all but two directors having joined the Board within the last three years.
0180.00037; The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee undertook a thorough review process to identify and evaluate candidates best suited to provide value to Brookdale's Board, including candidates with significant healthcare, senior housing, hospitality and sales and marketing experience.
0180.00038; Notably, sales and marketing experience is not represented on the Board, and the Board and Committee believe such representative experience is crucial to support management's sales and marketing efforts in the turnaround strategy and to create long-term value for stockholders. As part of this process, the Committee engaged a leading executive search firm, Korn Ferry International, who conducted interviews with numerous individuals, including Land & Buildings' director nominees, which included current nominee Jay Flaherty and Land & Buildings founder and CIO Jonathan Litt, prior to Land & Buildings withdrawing Mr. Litt's nomination. Freed currently serves as Royal Caribbean International's Senior Vice President of Sales, Trade Support and Service, where she oversees the largest sales team in the cruise line industry.
0180.00039; She has more than 25 years of executive leadership experience in the hospitality industry in the areas of sales, customer service and marketing. Mr. Sansone currently serves as a Managing Director and Chairman of the Healthcare Industry Group at Alvarez & Marsal, a global professional services firm specializing in performance improvement for large, high-profile businesses.
0180.00040; He has more than 25 years of experience working as a senior advisor and executive leading efforts to optimize the performance of companies, primarily in the healthcare and senior housing industries.
0180.00041; Despite Land & Buildings withdrawing its nomination of Jonathan Litt for election to the Brookdale Board, it is important to note that Land & Buildings, the investment fund he founded and serves as CIO of, is still actively seeking to gain influence and representation on the Board through the candidacy of Jay Flaherty.
0180.00042; Mr. Flaherty was considered as a potential candidate as part of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's review process. The Committee determined that, among other factors, Mr. Flaherty's predominantly real estate background would not be additive to the broader skill set necessary for the Board of a leading healthcare operator such as Brookdale.
0180.00043; If elected, we believe Ms. Freed's and Mr. Sansone's diverse expertise will strengthen the Company's ongoing efforts to leverage our scale and growing demographics to become the nation's first choice in senior living and thereby create significant long-term value for stockholders.
0180.00044; Today, our Board profile demonstrates our commitment to refreshment, diversity, gender parity and broader governance best practices:  Seven of eight directors are independent.
0180.00045; Four of eight directors on the Board are female. Two of eight directors were added to the Board at the recommendation of stockholders. Four of eight directors have been newly appointed since July 2017, three of whom are independent.
0180.00046; Following the 2019 Annual Meeting, the Board's average tenure will be less than three years, which is well below relevant benchmarks.
0180.00047; Furthermore, as part of Brookdale's commitment to improving corporate governance in connection with our comprehensive organizational turnaround, we have proposed amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, which include:  Declassifying the Board by the 2021 Annual Meeting Accelerating annual elections of Class II directors standing for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting Eliminating the supermajority vote requirement for stockholders to be able to remove directors Instituting proxy access and Implementing a majority voting standard in uncontested elections.
0180.00048; We are committed to continually improving our performance and corporate governance, and working to drive sustained stockholder value. -  THE OPCO/PROPCO STRUCTURE WOULD DAMAGE THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM PROSPECTS AT A TIME OF GREAT OPPORTUNITY  Based on our thorough and open-minded evaluation, we believe that the OpCo/PropCo structure proposed by Land & Buildings is a short-sighted financial engineering plan that jeopardizes Brookdale's current progress toward a long-term strategy to deliver sustained stockholder value, as well as the Company's ability to provide superior service and care to our residents and patients. We believe that Mr. Flaherty's election to the Brookdale Board would result in a repeated push for the adoption of this single-minded and fundamentally flawed plan, to the potential detriment of Brookdale's momentum under its strategic plan.
0180.00049; At its core, Brookdale is a healthcare company that intentionally owns real estate.
0180.00050; Our ability to retain residents and patients is intrinsically linked to the standard of service and care that we provide day in and day out.
0180.00051; Over the past several years, we have made the deliberate decision to invest in both our workforce and the quality of our communities. As reported in the second quarter, our Net Promoter Score® (NPS®) is up over 20% since our last survey, with over 50,000 customer responses.
0180.00052; It is no surprise that as our customer satisfaction improves, so do our financial results.
0180.00053; The proposed OpCo/PropCo structure would result in two independent public companies with uncertain long-term prospects while severely impairing our ability to execute our turnaround strategy. Even viewed with a short-term perspective, we believe that the OpCo/PropCo structure is an inferior alternative to our comprehensive strategic plan as it carries significant execution risk and is unlikely to achieve the expected trading values outlined by Green Street Advisors (Green Street).
0180.00054; Green Street's analysis was commissioned by Land & Buildings, prepared by Green Street's Advisory and Consulting Group, and carries an explicit disclaimer to distance itself from Green Street's reputable REIT Research team. Green Street's analysis contains numerous flaws and errors in judgment, including that it:  Assumes PropCo trades at a premium to net asset value (NAV) despite critical structural issues such as single tenant concentration, elevated leverage, and low coverage leases.
0180.00055; Healthcare REITs with similar issues are trading at significant discounts to NAV. Ignores conventional earnings and yield-based REIT valuation metrics. Valuing PropCo based on AFFO multiple and dividend yield would result in a materially lower share price due to PropCo's weak cash flow profile.
0180.00056; Uses unrealistic $1.5 billion equity offering assumptions.
0180.00057; An equity offering of this size represents approximately 90% of pre-deal PropCo NAV.
0180.00058; Only a handful of real estate IPOs have either been larger or have represented a greater share of pre-deal NAV, and the combination of both of these characteristics is unprecedented.
0180.00059; Combined with the structural issues, such an offering carries significant execution risk and would require a substantial pricing discount, as opposed to Green Street's assumed 9% premium to its ascribed NAV, resulting in significant dilution to current stockholders.
0180.00060; Recommends a subscale standalone OpCo with questionable viability, weak financial strength and limited ability to access capital markets, which would be unlikely to trade at the assumed EBITDA multiple as a separate public company.
0180.00061; Ignores material friction costs and impediments, such as lender and landlord consents (including significant potential lease extension costs), as well as tax, regulatory, and resident retention impacts.
0180.00062; These friction costs and impediments could significantly degrade stockholder value.
0180.00063; In failing to understand fundamental market dynamics, Green Street's analysis substantially underestimates the potential for long-term value creation under the Company's current strategy. As unanimously determined by both our Board of Directors and its Investment Committee, with the assistance of BofA Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, two leading independent advisors, Brookdale is pursuing a path that will provide superior value to executing an OpCo/PropCo transaction. In connection with the execution of our turnaround strategy, we've refreshed our management team, made significant investments, and executed a number of initiatives.
0180.00064; We are beginning to see the early results from all of these changes, including improvements in move-ins and associate turnover.
0180.00065; We believe that our strategic initiatives, focused on empowering our people, improving operations, and optimizing our portfolio, will help us deliver 7% NOI CAGR in our consolidated same community portfolio through 2024, which we believe will translate to significant value over time to our stockholders.
0180.00066; -  BROOKDALE HAS THE RIGHT MANAGEMENT TEAM, THE RIGHT BOARD, AND THE RIGHT STRATEGY IN PLACE TO DELIVER RESULTS FOR ALL OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS  As a result of our high-quality care and personalized service strategy, today, Brookdale is the #1 Senior Housing operator in the United States.
0180.00067; Driven by our vision to be the first choice in the nation's senior living, we are focused on enriching the lives of those we serve with compassion, respect, excellence and integrity. We believe executing our strategy under our current structure is the best path to enhancing value for all stockholders. We're focused on doing the things that matter most to our communities.
0180.00068; We're focused on building the best team in the business. We're focused on improving the basics of our sales and marketing cycle.
0180.00069; We're focused on strategically allocating resources into our communities and delighting our residents.
0180.00070; And that is what is allowing us to outperform our senior housing peers and lead the way for our industry. -  WE URGE YOU TO PROTECT YOUR INVESTMENT BY VOTING FOR BOTH OF BROOKDALE'S CLASS II DIRECTOR NOMINEES LISTED ON THE WHITE PROXY CARD  Your vote is very important to protect the future value of your investment.

0181.00001; AAP AAP Tuesday, 24 September 2019 12:47 pm Federation Asset Management has bought a $10 million stake in wind power developer Windlab.Image: AP Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Email Us Wind power developer Windlab has lined up a new source of funding, with its founding shareholder selling its 18.4 per cent stake to private equity fund Federation Asset Management.
0181.00002; Federation bought the stake for $10 million, or 80 cents a share, a 3.75 per cent discount to Windlab's close on Monday, to become the ASX-listed company's biggest shareholder, said Federation's head of renewable energy, Stephen Panizza.
0181.00003; The idea is that we collaborate with Windlab to help them deliver on the project pipeline they have, Panizza told Reuters on Tuesday.
0181.00004; Windlab has run into delays on its projects due to challenges faced by Australia's electricity market operator in hooking up an influx of wind and solar farms to the grid. The delays have knocked the company's shares down 44 per cent in the past year.
0181.00005; I don't think the listed market sees the true value of the platform, Panizza said.
0181.00006; Windlab has used proprietary wind modelling technology developed by the CSIRO to acquire wind farm development sites in North America, Australia, New Zealand and southern Africa, with a total potential capacity of 7,406 megawatts of power, according to its website.
0181.00007; Windlab said in August it was reviewing options to improve shareholder value.
0181.00008; Its executive chairman and chief financial officer were not immediately available to comment on whether the partnership with Federation was the outcome of the review.

0187.00001; ILLINOIS (IRN)  -  State officials announced a tax amnesty program for delinquent taxpayers that could help the state collect $175 million in unpaid taxes.
0187.00002; Illinois Department of Revenue spokesman Sam Salustro said the program is open to anyone who has unpaid tax liabilities from July 1, 2011, to June 30, 2018.
0187.00003; People with unpaid tax liabilities can send in the balance of their tax liability to the state and fill out the necessary paperwork to get their fees and interest waived on the penalties.
0187.00004; The window to take advantage of the tax amnesty program begins Oct. 1. Taxpayers will have until Nov. 15, 2019, to make full payment on their unpaid taxes.
0187.00005; The taxes included in the amnesty program are only those liable to the state.
0187.00006; Salustro said that other taxes, such as property taxes or local taxes, are not part of the program.
0187.00007; Salustro said the state has sent out notices to most taxpayers who are eligible for the program. He encouraged those who owe back taxes to take advantage of the program.
0187.00008; J.B. Pritzker proposed the tax amnesty program earlier this year.
0187.00009; Lawmakers included the program as part of this year's state budget.
0187.00010; The Governor's Office of Management and Budget estimated the tax amnesty program will bring in $175 million in outstanding taxes to the state.
0187.00011; Now is an excellent opportunity for taxpayers with tax liabilities to pay what they owe and come into compliance with the law, Illinois Department of Revenue Acting Director David Harris said in a statement.
0187.00012; By taking advantage of this amnesty program, taxpayers can eliminate any eligible tax debts owed, without penalty or interest.
0187.00013; This allows them to have a clean tax slate with the State of Illinois.
0188.00001; Petrol prices could hit $2 per litre if Middle East tensions escalate Economists have warned that under a worst-case scenario Australian petrol prices could hit $2 per litre, if tensions between the United States and Iran escalate into a full-blown war.
0188.00002; A full-blown US-Iran conflict … could cause the oil price to rise to $US150 per barrel this year, head of global economics service at Capital Economics Jennifer McKeown told clients.
0188.00003; This is not our base case, but with President Trump claiming that the US is 'locked and loaded', the risks have increased.
0188.00004; Petrol prices could reach as high as $2 per litre.Credit:Ryan Stuart  Crude oil futures prices  -  which are considered the global benchmark  -  were trading at $US68.51 on Tuesday following a record single-day spike earlier in the week, data from Refinitiv shows.
0188.00005; A doubling in prices would lift crude oil beyond the record peak of $US147.50 per barrel hit just before the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008.
0188.00006; Advertisement  AMP chief economist Shane Oliver said each $US1 increase per barrel in oil prices leads to a 0.9 cent lift in petrol prices per litre, assuming no change to the Australian dollar.
0188.00007; Therefore, in a scenario where crude oil more than doubles to $US150 per barrel, petrol prices could surge above $2 per litre.
0188.00008; Loading  Based on data from the Australian Institute of Petroleum, the average capital city unleaded petrol price rose to a three-month high of 143.6 cents per litre last week.
0188.00009; Mr Oliver said if the current spike in oil prices were sustained it would lead to an increase in petrol prices of about 6 cents to 10 cents per litre.
0188.00010; An increase of that magnitude would offset recent income-tax refunds for low and middle-income households and also reduce the benefits of interest rate cuts, placing further pressure on consumer spending, he said.
0188.00011; In the latest ANZ Bank-Roy Morgan Research Australian consumer confidence survey, released on Tuesday, sentiment slumped to the lowest level in two years.
0188.00012; The decline was driven by a steep deterioration in expectations for household finances and the economy in the years ahead. Loading  While households feel okay about their current financial situation, they are clearly quite worried about the outlook, for both their own finances and the economy, ANZ senior economist Felicity Emmett said.
0188.00013; The minutes of the RBA's September board meeting released on Tuesday noted recent contact with retailers suggested that income tax offsets had yet to lift spending noticeably. But, the RBA said that income tax rebates were expected to boost household income, and thus support consumption growth, in coming quarters.

0189.00001; Exclusive  Company directors sell shares in their firms after good news and buy after bad reports, research from the Australian National University shows, prompting claims insider trading laws need to be overhauled. The research, released exclusively to The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, suggests directors are using their intimate knowledge of their companies to engage in so-called contrarian actions that are ignored by corporate investigators.
0189.00002; But the Australian Securities and Investments Commission has cast doubt on the findings, saying no country in the world penalises directors for their use of publicly available information.
0189.00003; ANU researchers say a study of 50,000 trades by directors show they may be using their inside information for long-term gainCredit:Tamara Voninski  The researchers examined more than 50,000 trades made by directors over a 10-year period up to 2015.
0189.00004; Advertisement  They found that in the immediate aftermath of a trading update or profit report, directors were more likely to sell shares following positive news but buy after negative views.
0189.00005; Even over longer periods before and after trading updates, directors were more likely to take a contrarian approach to the purchases of stock in their own companies.
0189.00006; Study leader Dean Katselas said while almost all cases of insider trading focused on the share movements immediately before the release of important information, there was almost nothing that examined what happened in the immediate wake of company reports. Good news was welcomed by shareholders who bought stock but in poor trading, ordinary investors shunned firms.
0189.00007; But directors showed the opposite traits.
0189.00008; Dr Katselas said the trend was evident in the tens of thousands of trades he and his team examined.
0189.00009; My results show these contrary trades were being made with non-public knowledge, privy only to company insiders, about the future performance of the firm, he said. It was the exact opposite of what you'd expect to see after either kind of news.
0189.00010; If the news had the potential to boost the share price, I found the directors were selling their shares, when normally, this is the time you'd expect them to be buying.
0189.00011; If the news had the potential to boost the share price, I found the directors were selling their shares  Dr Katselas said ASIC focused its attention on insider trading cases relating to share movements ahead of public announcements, but the data suggested the corporate watchdog should look after information was released. Loading  Directors had a better idea of how their firms would perform longer term than just in the hours or days after a trading update.
0189.00012; In the safe knowledge of what's coming in the future for their firms, these company directors and many of their associates are confidently trading in the opposite direction, which ultimately helps tip the share price back again, he said.
0189.00013; There hasn't been a single individual or company identified as breaking the law by trading in this fashion to my knowledge because it's generally accepted that the information is public.
0189.00014; But the corporate regulator said Dr Katselas's research suggested a completely different approach to insider trading to that taken by countries around the world.
0189.00015; A spokesman said ASIC actively monitored trading for misconduct and that the regulator's enforcement team used world-leading analytical tools.
0189.00016; However, based on a brief look at the research by Dr Katselas, his view appears to be based on a very different concept of what constitutes 'inside information' and 'insider trading' than applies in any comparable market anywhere, a spokesman said. His premise appears to be that most directors are trading on inside information whenever they trade, and are breaching the law simply by virtue of having an intimate understanding of the business.
0189.00017; By extension, therefore, this suggests that all directors (and for that matter, management) should be prevented from owning shares.
0189.00018; This proposition would be contrary to common market practice here and elsewhere, and also contrary to the law.

0190.00001; Booster shot: Corporate tax is cut now cut personal taxes September 21, 2019, 2:00 am IST TOI Edit in TOI Editorials | Edit Page, India, World | TOI  The headline corporate tax rate was cut yesterday through an ordinance by eight percentage points, to 22%. It's a bold step that seeks to unleash animal spirits by boosting sentiments, in an economy weighed down by weak aggregate demand.
0190.00002; The new tax rates are optional. Companies can shift to it provided they forego all tax exemptions.
0190.00003; Consequently, government avoided a mid-year disruption but provided a roadmap.
0190.00004; Along with tax rate cuts, enhanced surcharges introduced in the budget on capital gains have been rolled back.
0190.00005; The cut in headline rates for existing companies and an even lower rate of 15% for fresh investment in manufacturing represent a fiscal stimulus it may lead to Rs 1.45 trillion of revenue foregone.
0190.00006; However, the announcement should also been seen as a structural change.
0190.00007; India needs to compete with Asian emerging markets for investment.
0190.00008; At 22%, the headline rate is between that of Vietnam and Indonesia. The move had a mixed impact on capital markets.
0190.00009; Stock indices surged but so did interest rates on debt as the fiscal deficit is likely to widen. However, the step is the right one as a big announcement was needed to change the mood and yield better revenues in the medium term. Bringing in surcharges and cess, the effective corporate tax rate today is about 25.17%.
0190.00010; There is a stark difference between corporate tax rate and the top marginal tax rate of almost 43% for personal income.
0190.00011; Given that private consumption growth is trailing overall GDP growth, the effort to boost demand must encompass a cut in personal tax rates.
0190.00012; It will complement today's announcement and cost far less in terms of revenue foregone. The combined impact of corporate and personal tax cuts, aided by RBI's monetary loosening, may be the booster needed to reverse the 18 month long loss of economic momentum. This is not the time to hold back.

0191.00001; On September 10, 2019, OTC Markets Group (OTC Markets) sent the Company copies of two electronic newsletters (collectively, the Promotional Material), one of which was sent on September 9, 2019, by LionStockAlerts.com and the other on September 10, 2019, by AwesomeStocks.com., and requested comment from the Company.
0191.00002; The Company was not aware of the Promotional Material before receiving copies of such from OTC Markets on September 10, 2019.
0191.00003; The Company recognizes that this promotional activity coincided with higher than average trading volume in the Company's common stock.
0191.00004; However, the Company has no opinion as to whether or not and/or the extent to which the promotional activity affected trading activity because of the many factors that affect trading activity generally as well as the effect that recent issuances of public news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) by the Company and other companies in its industry may have had on trading volume.
0191.00005; In particular, on September 9, 2019, the Company's largest competitor in the adult stem cell field for the treatment of degenerative disc disease announced that it had entered into a strategic partnership with a global leader in pain management to develop and commercialize its stem cell candidate in Europe and Latin America. Following such announcement, there was a significant increase in the trading of such competitor's securities in the ensuing days.
0191.00006; The Company believes that such announcement may have been a significant factor in the increase in the trading volume of its common stock. To the Company's knowledge, after due inquiry of its management, directors and control persons, neither the Company, nor any of its officers, directors, controlling shareholders (defined as shareholders owning 10% or more of the Company's securities), or any third-party service providers have been directly or indirectly involved with the creation, distribution or payment of the Promotional Material, except as described below. Upon reviewing the content of the Promotional Material, it appears that certain statements and claims made therein were taken from the Company's website, historical press releases and other public documents, but the Company did not have editorial control over, or review in advance or approve, the content of the Promotional Material.
0191.00007; In fact, the Company was not aware that the Promotional Material was being released.
0191.00008; The Company understands that there are statements made in the Promotional Material which may be deemed to encourage investors to purchase the common stock of the Company.
0191.00009; Such statements only express the view of the authors.
0191.00010; The Company disclaims any potentially exaggerated or misleading statements contained in the Promotional Material. In addition, the Company has determined that certain statements included in the Promotional Material related to the Company and its business might be viewed as incomplete. Readers of the Promotional Material should not place undue reliance on the Promotional Material.
0191.00011; Specifically, the Company does not condone the use of sensational language to describe the Company's business prospects or any statements made regarding the urgency of investing in the Company's common stock (or any other similar statements).
0191.00012; Finally, the Company notes that investing in the Company's securities involves certain risks and uncertainties that investors should review prior to making any investment decision.
0191.00013; The Company encourages all investors to undertake proper due diligence and carefully consider all investment decisions.
0191.00014; The Company directs potential investors to rely solely on its filings and disclosures made with the SEC, available at www.sec.gov and as posted on the filings and disclosure page for BRTX on OTC Markets' website at www.otcmarkets.com.
0191.00015; In the last twelve months, the Company has engaged World Wide Holdings, LLC, doing business as Invictus Resources (Invictus), Sylva International LLC, doing business as SylvaCap Media (SylvaCap), Regal Consulting LLC (Regal) and Plum Tree Consulting LLC (Plum Tree) to provide investor relations and public relations services for the purpose of enhancing investor awareness of the Company. The Company is aware that Invictus was involved in the distribution of the Promotional Material.
0191.00016; The Company had engaged Invictus to provide investor relations services but did not have editorial control over, or review in advance or approve, the content of the Promotional Material.

0193.00001; Home / World Economy / World Economy News / Americans Are Saving More, and That Isn't Necessarily Good  Americans Are Saving More, and That Isn't Necessarily Good in World Economy News 23/09/2019  From the 1980s through 2007, household saving followed a predictable pattern.
0193.00002; It typically rose after a recession as people paid down debt and rebuilt balance sheets, then declined as they grew more optimistic  -  and spendthrift.
0193.00003; That hasn't happened during the current expansion.
0193.00004; The personal-saving rate, the portion of after-tax income that consumers don't spend, rose from 3.7% in 2007, at the height of the housing bubble, to 6.5% in 2010, the year after the recession ended.
0193.00005; But since then, rather than falling, it has drifted up, to an average 8.2% in the first seven months of 2019.
0193.00006; That is higher than the average for any full year since 2012, when incomes spiked as companies pulled forward dividend and bonus payments to beat a tax increase.
0193.00007; That is evidence to suggest that something structural has changed, and it's made the saving rate kind of sticky at higher levels, said Tiffany Wilding, a U.S. economist at Pacific Investment Management Co.
0193.00008; Saving, which is the slice of paychecks, dividends and other earnings that Americans sock away, was up 17% in 2018 from the previous year, according to recently revised figures from the Commerce Department, beating consumer spending's 5.2% and business investment's 7.8%.
0193.00009; The timing is no coincidence, says Paul Ashworth, chief North American economist at Capital Economics.
0193.00010; The tax cuts seem to have been saved.
0193.00011; He notes the saving rate jumped by a full percentage point in January 2018, the month after President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law.
0193.00012; Economists point to other factors as well, including greater caution among consumers scarred by the 2007-09 recession, aging baby boomers preparing for retirement and a widening gap between the rich (who save a lot) and the poor (who save little).
0193.00013; Higher saving can be positive when it represents prudential behavior, for example preparation for retirement. It can also act as a cushion against recession.
0193.00014; Rainy-day funds enable consumers  -  who account for two-thirds of economic output  -  to continue spending despite a job loss, reduced hours or slashed bonuses.
0193.00015; But whether savings serve as a recession cushion depends in part on how they are distributed.
0193.00016; Wealthier Americans are less likely than middle- and lower-income families to change their spending patterns after a windfall such as a tax cut or a setback such as a recession.
0193.00017; If you're a billionaire, and you find $100 on the street, you're probably not going to rush off to Walmart to spend it, says Ian Shepherdson, founder of Pantheon Macroeconomics. But if you've got no money, and you find $100 on the street, you are going to rush off to spend it.
0193.00018; While the latest saving data aren't broken down by income, some economists say the recent rise is likely being driven by the wealthy.
0193.00019; Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, estimates that the wealthiest 10% of Americans accounted for more than three-fourths of the increase in the saving rate since the tax cut.
0193.00020; That cut increased after-tax incomes of the upper one-fifth of households  -  those making at least $149,400 a year  -  by 2.9%, versus 1.6% for the middle fifth and 0.4% for the bottom fifth, according to the Tax Policy Center, a research group. Joe Norflus, a retired investment banker in Essex Co., New Jersey, whose income consists mostly of dividends and interest, said he benefited from the law's lower tax rates and saw his net worth rise.
0193.00021; But the earnings boost was fairly insignificant relative to his overall net worth, so he used it to increase his savings.
0193.00022; The tax cut didn't impact in any way, shape, or form my spending habits,  Mr. Norflus said.
0193.00023; On the other hand, economists say lower taxes did appear to boost spending by lower- and middle-class families last year.
0193.00024; One sign: Sales were up 11% at discount retailers tracked by Redbook Research, compared with 3.4% at department stores.
0193.00025; Regardless of the cause, if saving outstrips investment opportunities for a long time, some economists say, it can hold down interest rates, inflation and economic growth.
0193.00026; Such secular stagnation may leave less room to cut interest rates, making it harder for the Federal Reserve to boost growth during downturns.
0193.00027; Rather than being a virtue, saving becomes a vice, said Gauti Eggertsson, an economist at Brown University.
0193.00028; Mr. Ashworth said the data for a long time didn't back the argument that rising inequality would boost saving and weigh on growth.
0193.00029; That case looks stronger now that revisions have raised the saving rate, he said.

0194.00001; The message from Manchester United is clear: Success on the pitch remains the priority .
0194.00002; Yet those words ring hollow when Man Utd only seem to flourish off it.
0194.00003; In that respect, the timing of their latest financial results was unfortunate.
0194.00004; In the wake of a 2-0 defeat to West Ham that leaves them 10 points adrift of Premier League leaders Liverpool, came the announcement of record fiscal revenues of £627.1million.
0194.00005; For disgruntled supporters it only serves as confirmation of their worst fears.
0194.00006; That United will continue to spiral into decline so long as the Glazers are able to reap dividends. That Ed Woodward will remain untouchable so long as he continues to deliver commercial success to the club's American owners.
0194.00007; While Woodward insists United's ongoing financial health is vital to their chances of returning to the summit of English football, the fear for fans is that it will, in fact, maintain the status quo.
0194.00008; That six years of failure and counting will continue to be tolerated so long as noodle partners and experience centres can be sourced  -  and television revenues continue to grow.
0194.00009; United finished sixth and trophyless last season, yet replica shirts sold by the bucket-load.
0194.00010; More than 50,000 fans turned up at Old Trafford last week to watch Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side toil to a 1-0 win against Astana. Similar numbers will roll up for Wednesday's EFL Cup tie with Rochdale.
0194.00011; Where United are concerned, the normal rules do not apply. To view their financial results over the six years since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement, it would be easy to think nothing had changed at pitch level. Wages go up, shirt sales go up, social media impressions soar  -  revenues are sky high.
0194.00012; On the balance sheet, at least, United remain the dominant force.
0194.00013; And why wouldn't they? The Glazers  -  who are far more hands on than fans would like to believe  -  have filled key positions with experts in their fields. Woodward has changed the meaning of what it is to capitalise on the commercial potential of a football club.
0194.00014; Head of corporate development Matt Judge is a financing mastermind.
0194.00015; Group managing director Richard Arnold is a genius when it comes to big business operations.
0194.00016; With that level of expertise in place, it would be near-impossible for United not to be commercially successful.
0194.00017; As a trio they are the Glazers' galacticos.
0194.00018; But where are their equivalents on the footballing side?
0194.00019; Imagine, for a moment, how the owners would have reacted to six years of failure from a commercial point of view.
0194.00020; What if Woodward continually picked loss-making sponsorship partners?
0194.00021; If revenues plummeted in the manner of the team's league position over the past season, let alone half a dozen since Ferguson walked away from a side that won the title by 11 points? What if Woodward made commercial decisions to compare to three failed managers and a raft of transfer flops? Would they stand for it?
0194.00022; Would they demand change?
0194.00023; What if, from a business point of view United were crying out for, say, the equivalent of a director of football?
0194.00024; Would the Glazers continue to persist without one? When the world's most successful clubs all have an expert in that position, would they really persist without one if it cost them on the balance sheet, rather than the league table?
0194.00025; Would they?
0194.00026; Among the usual platitudes that come from these addresses to investors  -  vows to strengthen the squad etc  -  came Woodward's response to latest questions about the long-awaited appointment of a technical director.
0194.00027; United had been actively pursuing a candidate for more than a year  -  yet after another wholly unsatisfactory transfer window an appointment is still to be made.
0194.00028; Woodward's response was non-committal  -  but a serious concern must be the club's assertion that the summer was evidence that the recruitment process is heading in the right direction. While few would complain about the quality of the three signings in Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James  -  United paid top of the market prices for each of them.
0194.00029; Meanwhile, their failure to conclude negotiations in timely fashion left them unable to address other areas of the squad in need of strengthening. For instance, in attack, where Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez were sold despite no replacements coming in.
0194.00030; Likewise in midfield, where the departures of Marouane Fellaini and Ander Herrera have left Solskjaer seriously short of depth.
0194.00031; A director of football, head of football, technical director  -  however you phrase it  -  may not be the cure all for United's ills, but surely they would not have overseen a window that leaves the club with no 20-goal-a-season striker, no cover for Paul Pogba and no hope of getting anywhere near the top two. If success on the pitch really is the priority at Manchester United  -  they need to start treating it like the areas of the business that actually are successful

0198.00001; World  Politics & Government  Currency  Asia's best-performing currency may have more room to run Bloomberg  /  Bloomberg  September 24, 2019 00:46 am +08  -A +A  SINGAPORE (Sept 23): The Thai baht has been the runaway success among Asian currencies this year  -  surging more than 6% while the U.S.-China trade war has punished peers such as the South Korean won and Chinese yuan.
0198.00002; There are two reasons why it may rise even more.
0198.00003; The Thai currency has proven to be the preferred Asian hedge against global trade frictions, sheltered by the country's current-account surplus and record foreign reserves.
0198.00004; The baht shrugged off the last three spikes in U.S.-China tensions, and has shown to be the second least responsive to shock yuan moves among eight Asian currencies, according to a study by Bloomberg.
0198.00005; While U.S.-China trade sentiment has recently appeared to improve, a stiff test is approaching with high-level talks due to start in Washington early next month.
0198.00006; Given that expectations are now relatively optimistic, there appears to be increasing scope for disappointment -- all the more so as U.S. President Donald Trump is notoriously hard to predict.
0198.00007; Any setback should pave the way for more baht outperformance.
0198.00008; Swaps traders are reducing odds of another BOT rate cut  A second reason for possible baht strength is much closer to home.
0198.00009; The Bank of Thailand will review policy Wednesday, a month after cutting interest rates for the first time in four years.
0198.00010; The 25 basis-point reduction on Aug 7 caught economists by surprise, but had already been priced into currency forwards.
0198.00011; This time round, the six-month implied rate on baht forwards is just nine basis points below the 1.5% policy rate, compared with 56 basis points before the August meeting, implying much less prospect of further easing.
0198.00012; Most economists surveyed by Bloomberg also expect BOT to stand pat.
0198.00013; Although the central bank has said it's worried about baht strength, these concerns may have been alleviated last week by a more hawkish-than-expected Fed outcome on Wednesday, which will prop up the dollar.
0198.00014; At the same time, a build-up in Thai household debt may give policy makers an additional reason to stay on hold.
0198.00015; The Thai authorities have taken a number of steps in recent months to try and restrain the baht, including reducing the supply of short-term bonds to discourage fund inflows and cutting the limit on outstanding non-resident baht accounts.
0198.00016; These have had little impact so far  -  and there are no signs they will have any more success in the near future.

0204.00001; Though Goyal was pilloried for his recent slip about Einstein having discovered gravity.
0204.00002; (Reuters)  The government has done well to come out with a series of initiatives to boost India's flagging exports between FY14 and FY19, India's exports grew at less than 1% per annum.
0204.00003; The measures, announced last week, include replacing a WTO-non-compliant duty refund scheme with a compliant one and, with a Rs 10,000 crore higher outlay, there are measures to ensure a higher amount of export credit - around Rs 36,000 crore - is available at lower interest rates.
0204.00004; Other measures include ways to reduce the processing time at airports and ports, etc.
0204.00005; While a weakening rupee should help India's $330-bn exports grow, it is not clear how much these moves will help boost growth to reasonable levels in even the medium term, much less be able to reach commerce minister Piyush Goyal's $1-trn-stretch target.
0204.00006; Though Goyal was pilloried for his recent slip about Einstein having discovered gravity, he was right when he said that looking at the past didn't necessarily help predict how the future would unfold.
0204.00007; Between 1990 and 2018, while India's exports grew just 18 times, for instance, Vietnam's rose 102 times, as a result of which, its exports are 75% those of India today these were a mere 6% in 1960.
0204.00008; In other words, it is not how fast global trade is growing that is critical, what matters is seizing the opportunities that global trade throws up Vietnam didn't just catch the textiles boom, it also rode the electronics boom, and the possibilities that got thrown up with rising US-China tensions.
0204.00009; Seizing the opportunities, however, requires an almost complete retooling of India's manufacturing/regulations since no country can become an export powerhouse unless its local production is globally competitive cheaper export credit, for instance, is a good thing, but it cannot make an uncompetitive product into a world-beating one.
0204.00010; In which case, India needs to fix its infrastructure deficit, high corporate tax rates, high-cost labour and land, and reduce costs associated with bureaucratic red tape, convoluted decision-making, etc.
0204.00011; It is also critical that various sectoral distortions be corrected so, for instance, India's tax policies in textiles are biased against man-made fibres whereas global demand is for such materials, and not for cotton, which is the mainstay of India's industry.
0204.00012; Other sectoral policies also need to be fixed.
0204.00013; While India's policies on mobile phones have so far attracted mostly small players, the bulk of the $300bn global export market for smart-phones - 60% of this takes place from out of China - is serviced by four of five large companies, like Apple and Samsung it is difficult to see how India's exports of smart-phones can take off unless India is part of the global value chains of these firms.
0204.00014; There is, so far, little serious attempt to ensure that firms like Samsung and Apple shift their production bases to India the boom in India's automobile exports after Suzuki's entry ensured its entire vendor-base moved to India, though, should have made clear just how important being part of global value chains is.
0204.00015; Around 70-75% of global trade, in any case, takes place through value chains run by MNCs across the world.
0204.00016; Agriculture is another big area of export potential, but harnessing this requires moving away from today's stop-go policies towards agriculture exports - normally based on how local prices are faring - as well as those like MSPs that distort markets.
0204.00017; In the case of minerals, where there is big exports potential, similarly, India needs to both get its royalty-cum-tax regime right as well ensure all permissions - including licensing fresh mines and all environmental clearances - are given at the earliest.
0204.00018; Only a policy that aims at making a country more competitive can deliver top-class exports growth an exports-policy makes little sense on its own.

0204.00020; The Financial Express
0205.00001; By Rebecca Lake  September 16, 2019  Saving money may be at the top of your financial to-do list.
0205.00002; The challenge is figuring out how to save money from salary while covering your basic living expenses, paying down debt or working toward other financial goals.
0205.00003; If you're looking for tips on how to save money, you're in the right place. Take a look at 6 strategies that can help you save money from your salary paycheck. 1. Break your paychecks down First things first, go over your paycheck to see how much take-home pay you have to work with.
0205.00004; Your take-home is what's left after your employer takes out taxes, insurance and any other deductions, like 401(k) plan contributions from your salary.
0205.00005; Speaking of 401(k) contributions, an easy way to boost savings is to notch up your contribution rate. If you're wondering how much to save monthly, there's a simple rule you can follow. At the very least, it's good to save enough of your salary to get the full employee match into your retirement plan if your employer offers one.
0205.00006; So, as you're looking over your paycheck, figure out what your current contribution rate is and see whether you can bump that up by a percentage or two.
0205.00007; Even a fractional increase can make a difference in how much you're able to save long-term. This paycheck impact calculator can help you gauge how your take-home pay would be affected by upping your 401(k) savings rate. 2. Find money in your paycheck to save If you've been struggling to save so far, this is where you'll need to dig into your budget to see where you may be able to free up extra cash.
0205.00008; When it comes to saving money from a paycheck as a salary employee, it all comes down to keeping a good budget, says David Pipp, founder of finance blog Living Low Key.
0205.00009; If you have money to cover your cost of living and a little money for fun, everything after that should go towards savings. For example, one of your biggest budget expenses may be food. If you're dining out a lot, you could look for money-saving hacks to cut down on the cost.
0205.00010; Or, eliminate some meals out and eat more often at home.
0205.00011; Plan meals for the week, based on what's on sale.
0205.00012; Create menus that are designed to minimize food waste.
0205.00013; Shop with a list and stick to the list.
0205.00014; Consider using your grocery store's pickup service if it's free to avoid making impulse buys. Use coupons and cash back apps to earn cash rewards or discounts on groceries.
0205.00015; Check for bargains at your local farmer's market if you have one. Other expenses you may want to downsize include utility bills or subscription services you don't use.
0205.00016; You could also find savings in your budget by switching to a bank account with no fees.
0205.00017; Make your debt payments less expensive Consider how you can make your debt payments less expensive.
0205.00018; Refinancing student loans, for example, can help you get a lower rate.
0205.00019; This can also lower your monthly payment, giving you more money in your budget to save.
0205.00020; The same is true for transferring high-interest credit card debt to a new card with a 0% introductory promotional rate.
0205.00021; Make more money than your salary paycheck If you're falling short of your savings goal, maybe it's time to earn more.
0205.00022; There are two ways to save more money: earn more or spend less, says Ben Watson, CPA and personal finance expert at DollarSprout.
0205.00023; The best way is to do both at the same time: take on extra hours, start a side hustle, mow lawns or go crazy selling unused items on Facebook marketplace while taking a hard look at your budget to see what you've been wasting money on, says Watson.
0205.00024; Automate savings from your salary paycheck Once you know how much you need to cover your bills and expenses, you can set money aside from your paycheck to put toward your savings.
0205.00025; There are two simple, yet highly effective ways to do this:  Set up into your savings account from your paycheck. This way, the money goes straight to savings every payday.
0205.00026; If your employer doesn't offer direct deposit, you can set up an from checking to savings each time you're paid. You just choose the amount to save and the frequency you want money transferred and you're done. These two savings hacks can also be a great way to build your emergency savings fund or add money to savings for a long-term goal, like a down payment on a home.
0205.00027; Consistency can be your ace in the hole for growing your money Here's how this works.
0205.00028; You figure out what you need (or want) to save each month.
0205.00029; Instead of putting it into the bank right away, you keep it in cash at home.
0205.00030; You do this for a month or two to see if you ever have to dip into your savings for any reason.
0205.00031; After that, move the cash to a bank account.
0205.00032; If you're totally new to the saving habit, considering giving this strategy a test run, says Eric Holland, founder of family finance blog High Five Dad.
0205.00033; If you had to dip into savings, evaluate the reasons why, Holland says.
0205.00034; For example, it might be due to poor planning or an emergency.
0205.00035; Trying this little experiment can help you decide if there are any changes you need to make to your savings strategy. How much should you save each month?
0205.00036; That's a great question and it's an important one to ask if you're hoping to stretch your salary paycheck as far as possible.
0205.00037; The answer for how much to save monthly ultimately comes down to how much you're taking home, what your expenses are and how much, if anything, you're paying toward debt.
0205.00038; But if you're looking for some specific numbers to work from, the 50/30/20 rule is a good place to start.
0205.00039; The 50/30/20 rule advocates putting 50% of your income toward your essential expenses each month, spending 30% and then saving the remaining 20%.
0205.00040; You can do the math on your own or run the numbers through a simple calculator.
0205.00041; Over a year, that adds up to $13,800.
0205.00042; That number can include the 401(k) plan contributions mentioned earlier if you have an employer plan.
0205.00043; So, let's say you contribute 6% of your salary to your 401(k).
0205.00044; Your employer matches 50% of your contribution. This means $6,210 is going into your plan each year, based on the $69,000  median salary number mentioned earlier.
0205.00045; If you're basing your savings on biweekly salary paychecks, you'd have to save $291.92 every payday after your retirement contributions are taken out to hit the 20% total savings target.
0205.00046; The next step is to make sure you actually have that amount of money in your budget to save.
0205.00047; Are you ready to save from your salary? Have you established a regular savings habit yet?
0205.00048; If not, there's no time like the present. And as you start saving, remember to give those dollars a job. Having a clear financial goal or purpose in mind for the money you save can help motivate you to stay the course.
0206.00001; By coinmaker  September 24, 2019  Crypto is an Intangible Asset, Global Accounting Standards Body Argues Cryptocurrency News No comments  Cryptocurrency holdings are neither cash nor financial assets, but meet the definition of an intangible asset, at least according to an influential global accounting standards body.
0206.00002; The Korea Times said in a report on Monday that according to the Korea Accounting Institute, the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) made such decisions after a meeting in London in June. Indeed, the London-based IFRIC, which sets the International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS), concluded in a little-noticed document dated June 21 that holdings of cryptocurrency meet the definition of an intangible asset, on the grounds that (a) it is capable of being separated from the holder and sold or transferred individually and (b) it does not give the holder a right to receive a fixed or determinable number of units of currency.
0206.00003; Intangible assets are defined by the committee as non-monetary assets without physical substance.
0206.00004; It has also concluded that cryptocurrency is not equity and does not give the holder contractual rights of exchange.
0206.00005; Importantly, it said crypto is not cash because it is not, for practical purposes, a medium of exchange.
0206.00006; The Committee added that in some cases, cryptocurrency could be accounted for as inventory if an entity hold cryptocurrencies for sale in the ordinary course of business.
0206.00007; Stepping back, the treatment of cryptocurrency was not added to the committee's standard-setting agenda, which means that the recent disclosure only reflects the thinking of the body and not an actual rule.
0206.00008; But once the committee sets a standard, it tends to be followed, as IFRS is used in about 144 jurisdictions and is required for public companies in Singapore, South Korea and almost all of Europe, though the U.S. has so far been only using the framework of the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Accounting treatment for cryptocurrency has been in discussion since about 2016, with numerous talks held and papers submitted.
0206.00009; The IFRIC recently received 23 comment letters on the subject from a wide range of interested parties, including the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), The Indonesian Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Korea Accounting Standards Board (KASB) and the Accounting Standards Board of Japan (ASBJ).

0207.00001; Global Economic Developments Output growth across major advanced economies remained subdued, confronted by legacy headwinds, including the subsisting trade war between the US and China, regional hostilities in the Middle-East, rising debt levels, growing uncertainties around BREXIT and increasing political tensions between the US and Iran, including fragilities in the financial markets. In the EMDEs, output growth remained broadly mixed with some economies performing stronger than others. Consequently, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its projected global growth forecast to 3.2 per cent in 2019 from 3.6per cent.
0207.00002; Domestic Economic Developments Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 1.94 per cent in the second quarter of 2019, compared with 2.10 and 1.50 per cent in the preceding and corresponding quarters, respectively. This mediocre growth, we believe, is consistent with global trends of dampening output growth and was driven mainly by the oil sector, which grew by 5.15 per cent while the non-oil sector grew by 1.64 per cent.
0207.00003; At 57.7 and 58.0 index points, the Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMI) grew moderately for the 30th and 29th consecutive months, respectively, in September 2019.
0207.00004; This optimism in growth prospects is anchored on the new momentum of rising credit to the private sector.
0207.00005; However, the headwinds to the growth prospects remain high unemployment, rising public debt and heightening insecurity across the country.
0207.00006; The Committee noted the continued moderation in headline inflation (year-on-year) to 11.02 per cent in August 2019 from 11.08 per cent in July 2019, driven by decline in the food and core components to 13.17 and 8.68 per cent in August 2019 from 13.39 and 8.80 per cent in July 2019, respectively.
0207.00007; The development in the food and core components of inflation was partly due to improved agricultural production in the current harvest season, supported by the Bank's sustained intervention in the agricultural sector as well as the continued stability in the foreign exchange market.
0207.00008; The Committee, however, noted the upward pressure imposed on prices due to rising insecurity in the food producing areas of the country, increased liquidity injection from FAAC disbursements and late budget cycles. It also highlighted the imperative to address the economy's infrastructural deficits, such as power supply, upgrade of transport and production infrastructure as a means of reducing cost-push inflation.
0207.00009; The Committee observed that broad money supply (M3) grew by  5.65 per cent in August 2019, compared with the level at end December 2018, annualized to 8.48 per cent, but remaining below the 2019 indicative benchmark of 16.08 per cent. The growth was largely driven by the increase in Net Domestic Credit (NDC), which grew by 24.36 percent in August 2019 from the level at endmDecember 2018. The growth in NDC was accounted for by the significant increase in credit to Government, which grew by 94.33 per cent while credit to the private sector grew by 9.36 per cent in August 2019.
0207.00010; The Committee urged the Management of the Bank to explore new initiatives to further improve lending to the private sector, while calling on Government to adopt other ways of funding its operations outside the banking sector.
0207.00011; In the review period, money market rates oscillated within the standing facilities corridor due to prevailing liquidity conditions in the banking system.
0207.00012; The monthly weighted average Inter-bank Call and Open Buyback (OBB) rates increased to 8.00 and 13.37 percent in August 2019 from 6.52 and 11.01 per cent in July 2019, respectively.
0207.00013; The Committee observed the continued bearish trend in the equities market, while noting the increased activity in the sovereign bonds market, reflecting global trends and investor preference for fixed income securities. In the light of this development, the AllShare Index (ASI) declined by 11.62 per cent to 27,779.00 index points on September 13, 2019, from 31,430.50 index points at end December 2018.
0207.00014; Market Capitalization (MC), however, grew by 15.37 per cent to N13.62 trillion on September 13, 2019, from N11.72 trillion at end-December 2018. This increase in market capitalisation was attributed to the listing of 2.75 billion ordinary shares by Airtel Africa in July 2019.
0207.00015; This is evidenced by the sustained weakening of global growth across regions, amplified by the persisting trade tensions between the US and its major trading partners, rising corporate and public debt levels.
0207.00016; Committee's Considerations The Committee noted the decline in output growth in the second quarter of 2019, partly attributable to the delay in implementation of the 2019 budget.
0207.00017; It however, observed that this was an improvement over the corresponding quarter of 2018. In addition, it noted the broad slowdown across key economies and the response of major central banks to revise their policy rates downwards.
0207.00018; On price developments, the Committee commended the progressive moderation in consumer prices and urged the Bank to sustain its intervention in the real sector of the economy to reduce the output gap.
0207.00019; The MPC noted the improvements in the financial soundness indicators and urged the Management of the Bank to sustain its regulatory surveillance to ensure continued financial system stability.
0207.00020; The Committee, particularly noted the growth in the size of industry loans from N15.4 trillion in June to N16.23 trillion in September 2019. On the recent directives to deposit money banks to increase their Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR), the Committee underscored the need to grow consumer, mortgage and corporate credit to drive aggregate demand and ensure a reduction in unemployment and increase in output growth.
0207.00021; Consequently, the Committee urged the Management of the Bank to fast-track the development of the credit scoring system, to promote increased.
0207.00022; In addition, the Committee commended the introduction of the Global Standing Instruction (GSI) initiative aimed at de-risking credit in the industry by committing bank customers to repay their loans to banks.
0207.00023; The MPC further noted the increased supply of micro credit to key Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and efforts through the Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) Microfinance Bank to extend the reach of its credit facilities across the country.
0207.00024; The MPC however, observed that the growth in credit to the private sector remained significantly low, relative to the absorptive capacity of the economy. The MPC further underscored the linkage between high unemployment and heightened insecurity, emphasizing the critical need for urgent steps towards more jobs and wealth creation in the country. As an interim solution, the Committee called on Government at all levels to ratchet up public works programmes aimed at easing the threat of rising unemployment in the country.This, the Committee argued, would be achieved through efficiency in public spending.
0207.00025; The MPC also noted the Government's current drive to increase Value Added Tax (VAT), adding that this will improve fiscal revenue to support expenditure and reduce the budget deficit as well as Government borrowing when implemented. The Committee, however, noted that this was too little to close the gap in Government finances.
0207.00026; Consequently, the MPC called on the Government to, as a matter of urgency, adopt what it termed a BIG BANG approach towards building fiscal buffers by purposefully freeing-up redundant public assets through an efficient, effective and transparent privatization process.
0207.00027; This would raise significant revenue for Government and resuscitate the redundant assets to generate employment and contribute effectively to national economic growth. The MPC noted the unstable oil prices, its implications on accretion to external reserves and its persistent call on the Government to build fiscal buffers.
0207.00028; The Committee's Decision In its considerations regarding the policy options to adopt, the MPC as usual, felt compelled to review the options of whether to tighten, hold or loosen. The Committee noted the positive moderation in inflation, though slowly from 11.08 per cent in July to 11.02 per cent in August 2019.
0207.00029; Given that this was still above the target range of 6-9 per cent, and considering the pressure on reserve accretion caused by the relatively weak crude oil price, the MPC felt the imperative to tighten.
0207.00030; On the contrary, the Committee was of the view that doing so in the midst of a fragile growth outlook would increase the cost of credit, and further contract investment and constrain output growth.
0207.00031; On loosening, the Committee felt that this would result in increased system liquidity and hence, heighten inflationary tendencies in the economy.
0207.00032; In particular, the MPC was of the view that loosening would drive growth in consumer credit but without a corresponding adjustment in real sector output.
0207.00033; The Committee was also convinced that increased liquidity and interest rate moderation would result in exchange rate pressures as money supply rises.
0207.00034; As regards the option to hold, the MPC opined that the option requires a clear understanding of the quantum and timing of liquidity injections into the economy, before deciding on possible adjustments to the stance of monetary policy.
0207.00035; The Committee was also of the opinion that retaining the current position of policy offers pathways to appraising the effects of the suit of heterodox monetary policy to encourage credit delivery to the real sector, especially in the light of the subsisting implementation of the Loan-to-Deposit Ratio policy.

0208.00001; By Current Publishing on Fishers Community  By Tony Sandleben  The Fishers City Council unanimously approved an income tax increase of .1 percent to help fund the Hamilton County Dispatch Center.
0208.00002; Fishers Mayor Scott Fadness said the tax adjustment is meant to more evenly spread out the payment for the center.
0208.00003; Back in 2012-2013, the Town of Fishers entered into an agreement with all the large communities of Hamilton County to consolidate our dispatch center, Fadness said. Fadness said the plan was for all county communities to help pay for the center, but that did not happen.
0208.00004; Several smaller communities in northern Hamilton County, early on in the stage of this consolidation, did not pay anything into that agreement, Fadness said. Fadness said the money is important to keep first responders well-equipped for emergencies. He cited last year's Noblesville West Middle School shooting as an example.
0208.00005; The active shooter scenario that we had in Noblesville last year, when we had several different jurisdictions responding, thousands of calls being flooded, we had to make sure that we had the reliability of a sustainable network that would allow us to communicate in those critical minutes that make the difference between life and death, Fadness said.
0208.00006; Not everyone supported the measure. Fishers resident Michael Colby said a redistribution of funds should pay for the center, not a tax increase.
0208.00007; I recommend you take a look at some of the spending that's being done elsewhere in the community and redirect those funds to pay for this to keep it off the backs of the taxpayers, Colby said.
0208.00008; City councils in Carmel, Noblesville and Westfield also must discuss the tax increase.
0208.00009; If city governments including half of the population of Hamilton County approve the increase, it will become law. Current Publishing

0210.00001; Long Ideas | Financials | Germany  |  About: Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (DB)  by: Labutes IR  Labutes IR  Long/short equity, mutual fund manager, foreign companies, banks  Summary  Deutsche Bank's new strategy seems to be credible and should lead to a more sustainable bank in the long term.
0210.00002; Significant restructuring charges will affect earnings in 2019 and 2020, thus a re-rating based on improving profitability is not expected during this period.
0210.00003; Nevertheless, its depressed valuation makes downside quite limited, and Deutsche Bank is a deep value play right now for long-term investors.
0210.00004; As I've discussed previously, Deutsche Bank (DB) has fixed many of its issues in the recent past, but its business strategy needed to change for the bank to be profitable in a sustainable way.
0210.00005; The bank's management acknowledged this reality and has recently revealed a new strategy, aiming to change Deutsche Bank's business profile in the next few years. If executed well, the bank can improve a lot its profitability, and its current depressed valuation makes downside limited, while upside can be significant if the bank reaches its financial targets in the coming years.
0210.00006; Deutsche Bank has been one of the global banks most affected by the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and the overcapacity in the investment banking industry worldwide. Moreover, due to past misconduct, Deutsche Bank's earnings were negatively impacted for several years from high litigation costs, leading to negative earnings in some years or very low levels of profitability in others. Deutsche Bank has resolved most of its litigation cases until 2017 and performed a capital increase to regain investor and customer confidence, but its financial performance continued to be quite poor compared to most of its peers.
0210.00007; Therefore, a couple of months ago, the bank announced a new group strategy focused on fixing the bank's woes in the next 3-5 years.
0210.00008; The main goal is to improve the bank's profitability, measured by its return on equity ratio (ROE), a performance indicator that has been below its cost of capital since 2009, which means that Deutsche Bank has destroyed shareholder value nearly for a decade.
0210.00009; To improve its business profile, Deutsche Bank has decided to focus on businesses where it has some competitive advantage and exit operations that had losses or low profitability.
0210.00010; This means that Deutsche Bank will increase its focus on the corporate bank, while, on the other hand, it will downsize its investment banking activities through the exit of equities sales & trading and resize fixed income operations. The goal is to have a smaller bank, but with a more sustainable business model less dependent on capital markets in the long term.
0210.00011; To achieve this, Deutsche Bank has decided to create a new Capital Release Unit (CRU), to where it transferred some €74 billion ($81 billion) of risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and €288 billion ($316 billion) of leverage exposure.
0210.00012; This will improve the bank's revenue profile of the core businesses, being less exposed to volatile activities as seen in the next graph.
0210.00013; Source: Deutsche Bank  Its goal is to eliminate these assets from the bank's balance sheet in a few years, which is expected to have restructuring costs of more than about €2 billion ($2.2 billion) in the next three years plus accounting charges (non-cash expenses) and liberate some €5 billion ($5.5 billion) of capital until 2022.
0210.00014; As the bank will cut more than 20% of its RWAs and leverage exposure, it does not expect to increase capital during the next few years, something that seems to be achievable given the significant reduction in total assets.
0210.00015; Other key financial targets are for core revenue of €25 billion ($27.5 billion) in 2022, adjusted costs of €17 billion ($18.7 billion) and a return on tangible equity (RoTE) of 8%. This means that Deutsche Bank expects to increase revenue at about 2% per year during 2019-2022, reduce costs by 7% per year and increase its profitability (RoTE) from only 0.5% to a level much closer to its cost of capital.
0210.00016; This strategy makes sense and targets seem to be conservative, but execution risk is high and the bank's track record on previous restructuring programs is very weak.
0210.00017; This means that Deutsche Bank needs to rapidly show good execution of its plan to gain credibility from investors, with a rapid reduction of its CRU assets the major milestone to achieve in the short term. Indeed, Deutsche Bank expects the majority of the CRU run-down to happen in the next 18 months, showing that it wants to rapidly change the group's balance sheet and revenue profile, something that is key for a change of investor sentiment towards the bank.
0210.00018; Source: Deutsche Bank  Regarding its capitalization, Deutsche Bank currently has sound capital metrics that enable it to absorb capital hits without the need to raise new capital.
0210.00019; In the short term, the restructuring program is expected to reduce Deutsche Bank's fully loaded core tier 1 (FL CET1) ratio to a level of about 13%, which is still an adequate level.
0210.00020; Going forward, due to its less risky business profile, it targets a FL CET1 ratio of at least 12.5% compared to 13% previously.
0210.00021; Given this capital target, the bank only expects to have an excess capital position in 2021 and, therefore, has suspended dividend payments in the coming years. Source: Deutsche Bank. It expects to return capital to shareholders again starting in 2022, but this depends on sound execution of its business plan.
0210.00022; The market seems to be giving the bank the benefit of the doubt, given that current consensus expectations expect a small dividend payment in 2020, contrary to the bank's own dividend guidance. Beyond its new strategy, Deutsche Bank also has announced recently earnings related to Q2 2019, maintaining a relatively weak performance, especially at its investment banking unit. Its revenues during the first six months of 2019 declined significantly (-5% year-on-year), while revenues in the investment banking dropped by 12% year-on-year (yoy), being the major drag to Deutsche Bank's top-line in the most recent quarters.
0210.00023; Equities and fixed-income reported an 18% decline in revenues compared to the same period of last year, showing that the bank's strategy of reducing its exposure to investment banking is the right one, after several years trying to defend its position in this industry.
0210.00024; Source: Deutsche Bank  Other units performed better reporting slightly higher revenues compared to H1 2018, which bodes well for the future as the bank decreases its reliance on more market-sensitive activities. Nevertheless, despite strong capital markets in the past few months, Deutsche Bank's asset management unit increased revenues by only 1% yoy, which is not an impressive achievement compared to some of its peers. Even though asset management is an area where the bank has better growth prospects over the long term, this relatively weak performance shows that Deutsche Bank needs to regain customer confidence to grow its business and achieve revenue growth in core activities.
0210.00025; Regarding costs, Deutsche Bank's cost-to-income ratio was above 100% in the first half of 2019 (including the CRU unit), a terrible level that means Deutsche Bank was not able to make an operating profit during this period. This happens because revenue erosion is faster than cost reductions, showing that stabilizing revenues is critical for the bank to improve its financial profile.
0210.00026; Considering only the 'core bank', Deutsche Bank's cost-to-income ratio was 90%, still a very high level and one of the worst in the European banking sector.
0210.00027; The bank targets a cost-to-income ratio of 70% by 2022 by cutting some €6 billion ($6.6 billion) in annual expenses and some revenue growth, which should be the key to reach its profitability target in the medium term.
0210.00028; Due to one-off deferred tax assets (DTA) impairment of €2 billion ($2.2 billion) in the past quarter, Deutsche Bank's reported bottom-line in Q2 2019 was negative in more than €3.1 billion ($3.4 billion).
0210.00029; This means that the bank will report again an annual loss this year due to restructuring costs, but even excluding extraordinary items the profit in the last quarter was quite low which is a bad signal for the bottom-line in the next year. Despite the significant reported loss, Deutsche Bank's capital hit was only 32 basis points and its FL CET1 ratio was 13.4% at the end of June, still a good capitalization level within the European banking system.
0210.00030; Source: Deutsche Bank.
0210.00031; Going forward, Deutsche Bank is expected to report significant restructuring charges in the next few quarters due to its rundown of assets in the CRU unit and, according to analysts' estimates, only return to report a meaningful profit in 2021.
0210.00032; However, there is a significant execution risk regarding its business plan and the macroeconomic environment has deteriorated further in the past two months due to increasing expectations of lower rates for longer in Europe, which has prompted the bank to slightly change its guidance of revenue target in 2022 from about €25 billion, to €24-25 billion.
0210.00033; Given that Deutsche Bank's strategy was presented only two months ago, this is not a good signal and doesn't help investors and customers regain confidence in the bank rapidly. Deutsche Bank's new strategy seems to make sense and will change significantly the bank's financial profile, which should lead to a much more sustainable and stronger banks in a few years. Then, it may pursue a different strategy, namely grow through acquisitions in the asset/wealth management industry.
0210.00034; After several years of very weak share price performance, Deutsche Bank currently trades at a very low valuation of only 0.27x book value. This means that downside seems limited right now and upside can be significant if the bank executes well its new strategy.
0210.00035; However, this will take time, and Deutsche Bank can be a good deep value play for long-term investors, but for more risk-averse investors, I suggest to remain on the sidelines for the time being.

0212.00002; Posted by Staff MMJStockWatch | Sep 17, 2019 | Stock News  Photo credit: commons.wikimedia.org  Only buy something that you'd be perfectly happy to hold if the market shut down for 10 years.
0212.00003; -  Warren Buffett  Click Here For The Top Dividend Stocks 2009-2019   The Warren Buffett investment philosophy calls for a long-term investment horizon, where a decade-long holding period, or even longer, would fit right into the strategy.
0212.00004; How would such a strategy have worked out for an investment into Franklin Resources Inc (NYSE: BEN)?
0212.00005; This would have turned a $10K investment made 10 years ago into $11,778.59 today (as of 09/16/2019).
0212.00006; On a total return basis, that's a result of 17.82% (something to think about: how might BEN shares perform over the next 10 years?).
0212.00007; [These numbers were computed with the Dividend Channel DRIP Returns Calculator.]
0212.00008; Always an important consideration with a dividend-paying company is: should we reinvest our dividends?Over the past 10 years, Franklin Resources Inc has paid $10.91/share in dividends. For the above analysis, we assume that the investor reinvests dividends into new shares of stock (for the above calculations, the reinvestment is performed using closing price on ex-div date for that dividend).
0212.00009; Based upon the most recent annualized dividend rate of 1.04/share, we calculate that BEN has a current yield of approximately 3.50%.
0212.00010; Another interesting datapoint we can examine is 'yield on cost'  -  in other words, we can express the current annualized dividend of 1.04 against the original $33.75/share purchase price.
0212.00011; This works out to a yield on cost of 10.37%.
0212.00012; More investment wisdom to ponder: Taking risks is really the only way to consistently achieve above-average returns.

0215.00001; (Reuters) - A Delaware judge ruled on Friday that Tesla Inc's (TSLA.O) board of directors must defend at a trial Chief Executive Elon Musk's multibillion dollar pay package, which a shareholder lawsuit said unjustly enriched the head of the electric vehicle company.
0215.00002; FILE PHOTO: Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk attends the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) in Shanghai, China August 29, 2019. REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo  Tesla estimated the 2018 compensation package was worth $2.6 billion when it received stockholder approval in March 2018, although stock analysts at the time said it could be worth up to $70 billion if the company - which has yet to post an annual profit - grew quickly.
0215.00003; The compensation award includes no salary or cash bonus for the Silicon Valley billionaire Musk, but sets rewards based on Tesla's market value rising to as much as $650 billion over the next decade.
0215.00004; On Friday, Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of the Delaware Court of Chancery ruled against Tesla's request to dismiss the lawsuit by shareholder Richard Tornetta at an initial phase in the litigation because of the way the board approved the package. As a result, the board must now defend against allegations that it breached its fiduciary duty in approving the package, and that the package unfairly enriches Tesla's CEO.
0215.00005; The ruling opens the way for additional discovery into the decision-making process.
0215.00006; Tornetta had asked that the pay package be rescinded and the board of Tesla be overhauled to better protect investors.
0215.00007; The ruling turned on Tesla's compensation committee, which the company conceded was not independent of Musk, according to Slight's opinion.
0215.00008; Had the package been negotiated by truly independent directors and approved by a majority of shareholders who were unaffiliated with Musk, Slights said he would have dismissed the lawsuit. Plaintiff has well pled, however, that the board level review was not divorced from Musk's influence, Slights wrote.
0215.00009; Musk's compensation package passed shareholder approval with about 73 percent of votes cast, excluding votes by Musk and his brother Kimbal. The vote result indicated some, but not all, big investors were prepared to support a large payout at the founder-led company, which has struggled to produce its electric vehicles efficiently and profitably. At the time, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services recommended voting against the compensation, noting that if achieved Musk's award would surpass anything previously granted to top U.S. executives.
0215.00010; Under the award, which involves stock options that vest in 12 tranches, Tesla's market value must increase to $100 billion for the first tranche to vest and rise in additional $50 billion increments for the remainder.
0215.00011; The package does not require Tesla to hit profitability metrics.
0215.00012; Musk does not hold a majority of the Tesla's stock, but in a separate case, Slights determined that Musk's sway over Tesla made him in effect a controller from a legal standpoint. As a controller, the board is subject to a higher standard of legal oversight for decisions it makes regarding its relationship with Musk. The judge did dismiss Tornetta's claim that the package amounted to a waste of corporate assets.

0216.00001; McConnell says he's a friend to coal.
0216.00002; But will his record with miners hurt him in 2020? James Bruggers InsideClimate News  Published 6:24 AM EDT Sep 24, 2019  WHITESBURG, Ky.  -  Mitch McConnell staked his last Senate campaign five years ago in large part on his support for the coal industry and coal miners.
0216.00003; But McConnell's unwillingness to shore up the fund that supports miners with black lung disease or their pension fund, even after dozens of his constituents traveled 10 hours by bus this summer to his Washington office, has allowed a well-funded opponent to seize on what should be McConnell's strength: coal.
0216.00004; Coal miners risked their lives to fuel our country and our growth into a world power, Democratic challenger Amy McGrath says in a recent attack ad.
0216.00005; Borrowing a union battle cry that still echoes in the hills and hollows around here after more than 80 years, McGrath says: The question for anyone in Congress is, which side are you on? In an indication that it struck a nerve, McConnell's campaign quickly hit back with his own ad, asserting that Kentucky coal country knows that Mitch fights and wins for miners.
0216.00006; As the coal economy of Eastern Kentucky has collapsed in recent years after decades of decline, there's a growing impatience expressed even by some local Republicans and community activists with McConnell's leadership on behalf of sick and out-of-work coal miners and their struggling towns in his home state.
0216.00007; McConnell has propped up a dying coal industry as the economic engine of the region, instead of going all-in on supporting economic diversity that could provide a future for communities.
0216.00008; He failed to support legislation that would reclaim mine land for economic development.
0216.00009; He shied away from a bipartisan coalition in his state that is nurturing tech, medical and even solar jobs.
0216.00010; He led the Republican effort to cut taxes on the coal companies  -  taxes that would help struggling miners.
0216.00011; He has not pushed to shore up a badly underfunded miners' pension fund.
0216.00012; See also: Protesting miners focus nation's attention on coal's problems  McConnell and other Kentucky politicians doubled down on coal at a time when they should have been shifting energy and resources to what was going to come after it, said Jason Bailey, who follows the state's economy as executive director of the liberal-leaning Kentucky Center for Economic Policy.
0216.00013; That proved to be a tremendous mistake for the region.
0216.00014; Beyond his home state, McConnell's role as the all-powerful Senate majority leader and President Donald Trump's most important ally on Capitol Hill amplifies their campaign for sweeping deregulation of the fossil fuel industry and jeopardizes the nation's ability to fight climate change. In Eastern Kentucky, mining jobs have slid 88% since 1984  -  when McConnell was first elected to the Senate  -  from 29,801 to 3,449, as mechanization increased, companies embraced more mechanized strip mining coal reserves shrunk and demand for coal faded. Cheaper natural gas now outcompetes coal  -  and so do renewable forms of energy, such as solar and wind.
0216.00015; In April, for the first time ever, U.S. renewable energy hit a milestone, with the renewable sources producing more electricity than coal.
0216.00016; Coal mining is deeply embedded in Kentucky's economic and cultural history, the subject of bloody labor battles, deadly mining accidents and haunting folk music.
0216.00017; Still, there are signs that coal is losing its almost mythological hold over political leaders in a state where it has long been at the core of the power structure.
0216.00018; When McGrath, a former Marine fighter pilot who describes herself as a moderate Democrat, announced in July that she would challenge McConnell in 2020, it was no accident that she made reference to an ailing coal miner who is looking for someone to offer more than words.
0216.00019; McConnell declined an interview request.
0216.00020; His spokesman Robert Steurer said in an email that McConnell continues to advocate for pro-coal, pro-family policies to help ensure that coal miners and their families get the help they need to recover from the Obama administration's war on coal, which devastated eastern Kentucky.
0216.00021; Barry Johnson, a retired Kentucky coal miner and federal mining inspector who is a Republican, said most people in Eastern Kentucky are more practical than die-hard political, wondering who is going to take care of them, who is going to help along the way.
0216.00022; Whether people in coal country can count on McConnell, he said: I can't say. I think a lot of people, now, are asking themselves that question.
0216.00023; Earlier: McConnell asks Labor Department to support jilted coal miners  In 1984, when McConnell was seven years into his tenure as judge-executive of Jefferson County, he took on two-term incumbent Democrat Walter Dee Huddleston for his U.S. Senate seat.
0216.00024; It was President Ronald Reagan's landslide reelection year, and McConnell came from far behind in the polls to win, portraying his opponent as an absentee politician who missed key votes.
0216.00025; Coal was not a factor in the race.
0216.00026; Thirty-five years later, McConnell is now the longest-serving senator in Kentucky's history.
0216.00027; He's also the longest-serving Republican leader in the Senate, becoming minority leader in 2006 and majority leader in 2015, halfway through President Barack Obama's second term.
0216.00028; When the Obama administration adopted rules to curb pollution from coal plants and mines, McConnell accused the president of declaring a war on coal and ratcheted up his rhetoric as a leading Obama obstructionist.
0216.00029; Today, McConnell has amassed enormous power and could, by virtue over his control of the Senate, undoubtedly get the miners and their communities what they are seeking, said Norman Ornstein, the veteran political scientist and expert on Congress and American elections at the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute. McConnell exerts absolute control over the Senate's calendar, able to schedule votes on  -  or block  -  any bill he chooses to, said Ornstein, who doubts Trump would deny McConnell, his most important ally, budget requests for Kentucky. Whitesburg, in the far southeastern corner of Kentucky, has a compact downtown with narrow streets lined by brick and stone buildings housing small shops, lawyers, a newspaper, city offices and a library named after the late hometown author Henry M. Caudill.
0216.00030; Caudill's seminal 1963 book, Night Comes to the Cumberlands: A Biography of a Depressed Area, laid bare the despoiling of the mountains of Eastern Kentucky and the poverty of Appalachia and helped to move a nation to launch a war on poverty. The region still suffers.
0216.00031; A June report from the Appalachian Regional Commission, established by Congress in the mid-1960s to lift all of West Virginia and parts of 13 states out of poverty, including Kentucky, identified 80 counties across its region as economically distressed  -  meaning they rank among the worst 10% of counties in the nation.
0216.00032; Nearly half of those are in Eastern Kentucky, including Letcher County, home to Whitesburg.
0216.00033; And as the coal economy of Eastern Kentucky declined, the pain has been felt in many ways  -  community budgets have been slashed as coal severance tax payments to them plummeted the opioid epidemic has fueled despair and people have moved away to find work.
0216.00034; The county government budget is half of what it was when I went out of office, said Carroll Smith, a retired coal miner and school bus driver who served 12 years as the Republican Letcher County judge-executive.
0216.00035; It's getting hard for them to pick up the garbage.
0216.00036; The trucks stay broke down.
0216.00037; A coal mining operation outside Whitesburg, Kentucky, this summer. Photo provided by James Bruggers  See also: McGrath ad calls out McConnell for short visit with Kentucky coal miners  Fire departments are struggling to pay their bills. School funding has been slashed.
0216.00038; In my county, all children receive free lunches because of the level of poverty here, said Angie Hatton, a lawyer, coal miner's daughter and Democratic state lawmaker, speaking in the wood-paneled lobby of her Whitesburg office.
0216.00039; When you think of a community that poor, that unhealthy and opioid-addicted, you would think they don't have good representation in Congress.
0216.00040; McConnell should feel an overwhelming responsibility to be the voice of Eastern Kentucky, she said, while adding he does a lot of important things nationally and internationally.
0216.00041; Smith's views of McConnell and coal are more nuanced.
0216.00042; If I had to pick somebody to be hard on, it would be Obama, he said.
0216.00043; I don't think Mitch McConnell voted to do away with coal.
0216.00044; Whether he sat back and allowed it to happen and didn't do anything about it, that's another thing.
0216.00045; There certainly should have been some planning.
0216.00046; Snavely told a gathering of coal companies and representatives of Southern governors in May that he saw a greatly diminished future for the industry. Black lung is caused by breathing in coal dust, which leads to inflammation, scarring, shortness of breath and respiratory failure.
0216.00047; The complications can include chronic bronchitis obstructive pulmonary disease, which keeps air out of the lungs and lung cancer.
0216.00048; It can take years for the disease to develop, and there is no cure. The federal Black Lung Disability Fund provides more than 25,000 miners or their dependents with cash assistance and medical benefits.
0216.00049; The maximum cash assistance payments ranged from about $660 to $1,320 per month in 2018, depending on the beneficiary's number of dependents.
0216.00050; For more than 40 years, the disability fund was supported by taxes levied on each ton of mined coal. But when the tax was rolled back by 55% Jan. 1, as the mining industry had wanted, McConnell chose not to schedule a vote on legislation to stop the reduction.
0216.00051; After the General Accounting Office reported in June that taxpayer obligations to the disability fund, already $4 billion in debt, could swell to $15 billion by 2050 without further action by Congress, McConnell remained noncommittal on bills to restore funding and cut red tape so that miners could obtain benefits more easily.
0216.00052; What they have done is shift the cost to the taxpayers from coal mining companies, said Phil Smith, spokesman for the United Mine Workers of America.
0216.00053; It's corporate welfare. Steurer, McConnell's spokesman, provided a statement saying black lung benefits have continued as they have been and that the senator and his staff have been working closely with interested parties regarding future funding for the program.
0216.00054; But without further action by McConnell's Senate majority to restore the tax on coal, the disability fund could begin to run out of money as early as next year.
0216.00055; It will run out of money in 2022 or 2023 without federal assistance. The pension fund was paid for by payments from mining companies, but bankruptcies and mine closures have meant much of that money is no longer coming into the fund.
0216.00056; Its fate is now tied to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., a federal backstop for failed companies that cannot meet their pension obligations.
0216.00057; But the pension benefit corporation, also facing insolvency, often covers less than half of the pensions workers earned.
0216.00058; Nobody else can fix this problem, Smith, the union spokesman, said of McConnell and the recent coal company bankruptcies.
0216.00059; There isn't enough coal industry left to fix this.
0216.00060; The program is funded by a fee assessed on each ton of coal produced.
0216.00061; He said in late June that McConnell was solely responsible for the lack of action on a bill. With the pension fund very much on his mind, Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers, sidestepped a question at the National Press Club in early September about whether his organization would throw its weight against McConnell's reelection.
0216.00062; If you ask Mitch McConnell, we have rallied against him almost every election, Roberts said.
0216.00063; But, he added, our main goal here is to save our pension plan.
0216.00064; If Mitch McConnell wants to be part of saving our pension pan, I will publicly thank him and say I appreciate it very much, and that ought to be helpful to him and his reelection. If he does not, then we will have to reevaluate that.
0216.00065; Stuerer said McConnell has been looking for a broader solution that would involve other troubled pensions. Related: Lawmakers seek to close 'loophole' after coal bankruptcy  In 2013, when McConnell as Senate minority leader was sharply criticizing Obama's coal record, two leading Kentucky politicians chose a different road, with thousands of coal families hurting from layoffs.
0216.00066; Steve Beshear, the state's Democratic governor from 2007 to 2015, and Republican Congressman Hal Rogers, who has represented the state's Appalachian coalfield since 1981, agreed to hold a summit around a regionally difficult-to-swallow fact: Coal was no longer king  -  and it wasn't coming back.
0216.00067; The event in December 2013 drew 1,700 people. But not McConnell. He showed up in Pikeville a few days before the summit for a meeting of his own with hand-picked coal industry supporters to criticize the Obama administration's plan to curb carbon emissions from power plants.
0216.00068; The Beshear-Rogers summit launched the SOAR program, or Shaping Our Appalachian Region, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that has established a network of partners, including the Appalachian Regional Commission and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to create jobs, expand broadband, promote public health and fight opioid addiction.
0216.00069; To date, the program has begun a digital job training program through a $3.5 million grant from the ARC, helped support the installation of 800 miles of new fiber optic cable, helped create a call center for families seeking drug treatment, and supported a new treatment voucher program.
0216.00070; Jared Arnett, SOAR's executive director, said McConnell, while never an overt SOAR participant, has been supportive (of SOAR) behind the scenes and has sent his staff to some of the meetings.
0216.00071; McConnell has found the use of strong pro-coal rhetoric advantageous to what has always been his singular goal of winning elections, said Al Cross, the director of the Center for Rural Journalism and Community Issues at the University of Kentucky. Cross has covered McConnell his entire Senate career. Cross said a McConnell staffer once told him during an unguarded moment that fully embracing SOAR would be seen as throwing coal under the bus.
0216.00072; In written responses, Steurer, McConnell's spokesman, did not directly answer a question about his boss' participation in SOAR.
0216.00073; Instead, Steurer ticked off a list of McConnell's accomplishments. They include protecting the endowment of Kentucky's Berea College, which largely serves Appalachian students, from a new tax so that it could continue to offer free tuition, and securing hundreds of millions of dollars for various economic development efforts serving the wider Appalachian region, including Kentucky.
0217.00001; It had $28 billion in combined annual revenues and controlled dozens of food and beverage brands that for generations were staples of American households, including Heinz ketchup, Kraft cheese, Oscar Mayer meats and Planters nuts. These days, however, the mega-merger is a mega-mess.
0217.00002; Sales and profits have slumped.
0217.00003; After taking a $15.4 billion write-down in February and slashing its dividend by a third, the company reduced the value of its assets by an additional $1.22 billion last month.
0217.00004; Securities regulators are looking into its accounting, and after an internal investigation uncovered employee misconduct, Kraft Heinz said it would restate its financials for 2016 and 2017.
0217.00005; It faces numerous shareholder lawsuits.
0217.00006; And after laying off thousands of people over the last four years, it announced more job cuts in the second week of August. For the Brazilian-based investment firm 3G Capital and Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, the deal has so far been a rare  -  and costly  -  misstep. While their earlier acquisitions have produced big returns, the Kraft Heinz deal has created billions of dollars in paper losses.
0217.00007; The company's stock has plummeted 51 percent in the past year. Last week, 3G sold more than 25 million of its Kraft Heinz shares, bringing its stake in the company down by almost 10 percent. Some analysts and former Kraft Heinz employees place much of the blame at the feet of 3G and its use of a highly vaunted zero-based budgeting strategy that critics say focuses more on cutting costs than creating products that people want to buy.
0217.00008; Others analysts note that the company's profit margins are much higher than at peers like General Mills and Kellogg.
0217.00009; They argue that Kraft Heinz is facing the same headwinds as other large packaged goods companies, struggling to adapt as the public turns to healthier, and often organic, foods. There is also competition from retailers like Walmart and Kroger, which have private-label brands.
0217.00010; In August, Target announced plans for its own line of grocery products that it expects will include more than 2,000 items and become a multibillion-dollar brand by the end of next year.
0217.00011; Kraft's problems are in the marketplace, said Jim Peterson, a former Kraft executive who left before the merger and is now the chief financial officer for Price Chopper Supermarkets.
0217.00012; Do its products have the same appeal as they used to?
0217.00013; How are they going to grow revenues?
0217.00014; That's the dilemma they're in, and it's not easily answered. The person who will have to try is Miguel Patricio, who took over as chief executive in June. To truly change the direction of a business like ours, we need to understand the future, know where the consumer's needs and the marketplace are headed  -  and then invest quickly and consistently to make sure our core brands address those needs better than our competitors, Mr. Patricio said in an emailed statement.
0217.00015; Mr. Patricio declined to address questions about what happened before he arrived at the company, saying he was focusing on the next phase of growth.
0217.00016; He came to the company from Anheuser-Busch InBev, which 3G created in 2008 when it orchestrated the takeover of the American beer giant Anheuser-Busch by a company it operated called AmBev. More acquisitions followed.
0217.00017; In 2010, 3G acquired Burger King and took it private. In 2013, it teamed up with Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway on a $23 billion takeover of H.J. Heinz.
0217.00018; In 2014, the pair acquired the Canadian doughnut chain Tim Horton's, merged it with Burger King and named the entity Restaurant Brands International.
0217.00019; The firm's zero-based budgeting requires managers to justify every expense on an annual basis, not just build on the previous year's budget.
0217.00020; (3G did not respond to a request for comment, and Berkshire Hathaway declined to comment.)
0217.00021; When Kraft and Heinz merged, Bernardo Hees, a Brazilian economist who had led Burger King, became chief executive of the combined company.
0217.00022; He told analysts that the merger would yield $1.5 billion in annual cost cuts.
0217.00023; Managers and employees inside Kraft said they had spent long hours and weekends after the deal closed gathering data on everything from expected travel expenses to estimates of how many paper copies their departments would make that year.
0217.00024; Those figures were stuffed into voluminous spreadsheets and given to 3G.
0217.00025; That became the foundation for 3G's cost cutting. Travel for some departments was cut in half.
0217.00026; There were no more color printouts of presentations.
0217.00027; Office snacks  -  like the free Kraft cheese and Planters nuts that employees could grab between meetings  -  were eliminated.
0217.00028; The biggest cuts came in staffing.
0217.00029; In August 2015, about a month after the deal closed, Kraft Heinz laid off 2,500 employees, roughly 5 percent of its global work force.
0217.00030; That included around 700 people, or about a third of the staff, at Kraft's headquarters in Northfield, Ill.
0217.00031; In November, Kraft Heinz announced plans to shut down seven plants in the United States and Canada, cutting 2,600 more jobs.
0217.00032; From London to Chicago, important responsibilities once divided among multiple employees, like market analysis and negotiations with supermarkets, fell to a single individual or a small group.
0217.00033; With each round of layoffs, those who remained became increasingly dispirited, according to former employees.
0217.00034; In London, talk of growing discontent at the Kraft Heinz office made it difficult to hire, said a former high-ranking official at that branch, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.
0217.00035; Kraft personnel, including some with decades of experience, were replaced by 3G leaders, some of whom had virtually no experience in the consumer packaged goods industry, said Robert Moskow, an analyst at Credit-Suisse who tracks Kraft Heinz.
0217.00036; In other 3G companies, that strategy injected new energy and a new way of thinking and a way to get rid of sacred cows, he said. But it's a very risky strategy.
0217.00037; For the first year or so, it appeared the strategy was paying off.
0217.00038; Kraft Heinz's stock price climbed, and in early 2017 it offered to buy the European conglomerate Unilever for $143 billion.
0217.00039; After being rebuffed, Kraft Heinz withdrew the offer a few days later.
0217.00040; Problems soon began to emerge.
0217.00041; Sales started softening, and while 3G's cost-cutting efforts resulted in robust profit margins, the stock dropped as investors got nervous. This year, Kraft Heinz acknowledged that its problems ran deep.
0217.00042; The company disclosed it had received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission related to an investigation of its accounting. And in February, the company took the $15.4 billion write-down, signaling that its beloved brands were less valuable than when it acquired them four years ago.
0217.00043; Part of the issue, analysts say, was that 3G made its cuts when Kraft Heinz should have increased research and development to compete with the start-ups increasingly taking shelf space away from food giants.
0217.00044; In 2014, before the merger, Kraft spent $149 million on R&D.
0217.00045; In 2017, the combined Kraft Heinz spent $93 million, according to regulatory filings.
0217.00046; This month, Kraft Heinz shareholders criticized the company for falling behind in the market for plant-based meat, which has drawn a surge of consumer interest and investment from major food companies.
0217.00047; You're competing now with a lot of these typically smaller start-up companies who have some version of a less processed, more natural, potentially organic product that's more affordable and oftentimes better tasting, said Michael Lavery, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. It's made it tough.
0217.00048; Since the merger, some of the products that Kraft Heinz has introduced have drawn ridicule, like salad frosting, a repackaged ranch dressing designed to appeal to children. Other major food manufacturers are learning from Kraft Heinz's mistakes.
0217.00049; General Mills has managed to improve its margins while introducing new products, like revamped macaroni and cheese recipes and a line of French-style yogurts. Mondelez, the snacks giant, has invested in smaller food start-ups. We're actually in a higher cost of growth environment, where constant reinvestment is necessary, said Mr. Moskow, the Credit Suisse analyst.
0217.00050; You can't cut your way to prosperity.

0218.00001; Business  AT&T Chief Laid Plans for His Exit. That Set Off an Activist Challenge.
0218.00002; By Drew FitzGeraldWSJ Shalini RamachandranWSJ Corrie DriebuschWSJ  Fri., Sept. 13, 2019timer9 min. read  Randall Stephenson, AT&T Inc.'s longtime boss, got an unexpected phone call Sunday evening from a hedge-fund manager at Elliott Management Corp., one of Wall Street's biggest and most aggressive activist investors.
0218.00003; The call was brief and cordial, but behind it was a stinging rebuke of the telecom veteran's mission to turn the phone company into a media giant and leave a top lieutenant to finish the job.
0218.00004; Investor Jesse Cohn told Mr. Stephenson the hedge fund had concerns about AT&T's strategy and execution, reflecting worries percolating around the company, said people familiar with the matter.
0218.00005; Mr. Stephenson alerted his lead director.
0218.00006; Elliott's report Monday also questioned whether Mr. Stephenson's presumed successor could successfully integrate the conglomerate into a force able to compete for advertising dollars against the likes of Google and win a costly battle for streaming supremacy with rivals like Netflix Inc. and Walt Disney Co.
0218.00007; Plans for Mr. Stephenson's triumphant exit, as early as next year, now threaten to turn into a monthslong fight over the direction of the $280 billion telecom company and a test of the board's loyalty to his long-term vision.
0218.00008; The challenge issued by Elliott pits the 59-year-old AT&T chief executive against a 39-year-old Wall Street manager known for pressuring his targets to shake up their operations. Mr. Stephenson has spent most of his dozen years as chairman and CEO piecing together a modern media company that will be his legacy. The three-decade company veteran - who said HBO's Succession was one of his favorite TV shows - has signaled interest in stepping down as soon as next year, people familiar with his thinking said.
0218.00009; Mr. Cohn is seeking sweeping changes despite Elliott owning a $3.2 billion, or roughly 1%, stake in AT&T shares and options.
0218.00010; Other activists have used similar stakes to shake up corporations as big as Procter & Gamble Co. and General Electric Co., often taking seats on the board.
0218.00011; YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN... Mr. Cohn, a partner who runs U.S. equity activism at Elliott, has told other investors that he wants AT&T to explore the sale of DirecTV and other assets, as well as have a say in picking its next leader. Elliott must decide by the end of January whether to initiate a proxy fight, but Mr. Cohn told Mr. Stephenson that he wanted to work together. AT&T said it looked forward to engaging with Elliott, and that it was already pursuing some actions laid out in Elliott's report: AT&T's Board and management team firmly believe that the focused and successful execution of our strategy is the best path forward.
0218.00012; Mr. Stephenson, who declined to comment, has defended his strategy, saying AT&T is boosting its programming investments, helping HBO compete with growing numbers of streaming services and harnessing data from its phone and TV customers to compete with the biggest ad platforms. He has said AT&T's subscriber pool offers its media units a broad distribution system.
0218.00013; The business model does have to change, he said after winning an antitrust case last fall to buy Time Warner.
0218.00014; He will get a chance to make his case to investors Tuesday when he takes the stage at a Goldman Sachs conference in New York. Despite the high-profile acquisitions, AT&T shares have been flat since Mr. Stephenson took over.
0218.00015; They hit a multiyear low near $27 in December as investors worried about the more than $160 billion in debt the company had accumulated from its acquisitions.
0218.00016; The shares had gained 33% this year before Elliott released its letter.
0218.00017; Sam Hendel, president of Levin Easterly Partners, which owns roughly 3.5 million shares of AT&T, said he sees potential, particularly in wireless as 5G networks expand. Time Warner is a great asset, he said, but he agreed with Elliott that AT&T has to add experience in media to the board and senior management. Elliott, which is run by billionaire Paul Singer and manages about $38 billion, is known for its 15-year crusade to get Argentina to make payments on defaulted bonds and for battles with chief executives, including at Arconic Inc.
0218.00018; The Communications Workers of America, a union that represents about 100,000 AT&T employees, said Elliott's push would cut its workforce.
0218.00019; Anyone who thinks that Paul Singer and Elliott Management intend to 'deliver far-reaching benefits' to AT&T's customers is not familiar with the destruction this vulture hedge fund leaves in its wake, CWA President Chris Shelton said.
0218.00020; Conglomerates have fallen out of favor on Wall Street, where many investors now prefer nimble, focused companies. Investors this year have valued AT&T, which has about 30% more revenue, a top Hollywood studio and popular cable channels, slightly more than Verizon Communications Inc., which has largely stuck to the wireless business. These days, AT&T looks more like Comcast Corp., a cable operator that owns NBCUniversal and Sky.
0218.00021; When I was there, it was focused on becoming the biggest and best telecommunications company in the world and we sort of stuck to what we knew, said Edward Whitacre, who as chief executive from 1990 to 2007 rebuilt AT&T into a nationwide giant by snapping up regional Baby Bells.
0218.00022; But time has moved on and maybe they made the decisions that they had to make.
0218.00023; Last month, one of AT&T's top executives, John Donovan, announced his plan to retire after finding out he wasn't getting the top job.
0218.00024; Soon after, AT&T's board met to approve the promotion of John Stankey, one of Mr. Stephenson's longtime allies, to a newly created role of president and operating chief, making him the heir apparent. Mr. Stankey, 56, joined one of the Baby Bells in 1985 and rose through the ranks.
0218.00025; He and Mr. Stephenson share a friendship built through more than two decades as the regional phone company grew into the second-largest wireless carrier in the U.S.  Mr. Stankey backed the DirecTV deal and inherited the top post there and at Time Warner, where he took the helm last year.
0218.00026; The move pushed aside veteran executives in each company. He has clashed with those below him, according to former executives, and seen by some as imperious.
0218.00027; HBO boss Richard Plepler and Turner chief David Levy left.
0218.00028; The board voted unanimously to approve Mr. Stankey's promotion, spurring Elliott to go public with its stake, according to people familiar with the matter.
0218.00029; The hedge fund had been studying AT&T since the Time Warner deal.
0218.00030; It viewed the promotion of Mr. Stankey to oversee both media and companywide operations as hasty, the people said.
0218.00031; I'm a Stankey fan, said Mr. Whitacre, the former AT&T CEO, who described him as a smart strategic thinker.
0218.00032; YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN... AT&T will resist any attempt to dictate its executive suite, according to people close to the company.
0218.00033; Board members see room to improve AT&T's performance but support Mr. Stephenson's strategy and praise Mr. Stankey's leadership, according to a person familiar with the board's thinking.
0218.00034; There aren't many people from the outside who would be obvious candidates to run a complicated media and communications business, the person said.
0218.00035; A lot of people who run media companies don't know anything about operating a telecom business. That raises the prospect of a protracted, monthslong battle between the corporate behemoth and the hedge fund. AT&T is working with Goldman Sachs bankers, among others, to mount a defense against a potential proxy fight.

0218.00037; Sign Up Now  I don't think there's going to be much management change until there's blood in the street, said an investor familiar with AT&T's leadership.
0218.00038; When Mr. Stephenson took the reins of AT&T in 2007, there were no more Baby Bells to adopt. Regulators thwarted a 2011 attempt to buy wireless rival T-Mobile USA Inc.
0218.00039; In search of growth and cash flow to sustain AT&T's needs, including what is now a nearly $15 billion annual dividend, Mr. Stephenson looked to entertainment.
0218.00040; He closed the purchase of DirecTV in 2015, which turned out to be near the peak of the pay-TV market. There was internal disagreement over prospects of the newly enlarged business, which had amassed 26 million U.S. subscribers.
0218.00041; A board-level presentation in early 2014 warned that the number of pay-TV households were likely at their peak and expected to decline. AT&T's overall TV business has shrunk, and losses have accelerated. Analysts expect AT&T to end the year with fewer than 22 million paying TV customers in the U.S.  Elliott is seeking shareholder support to press AT&T to sell the DirecTV business, according to people familiar with the matter.
0218.00042; Industry M&A experts said it would likely be valued at less than $25 billion, excluding debt, about half of what AT&T paid. If it were put up for sale, there would be few interested buyers.
0218.00043; AT&T finance chief John Stephens said Wednesday that a hookup between DirecTV and satellite rival Dish Network Corp. has been tried already.
0218.00044; From a regulatory perspective, he said, it hasn't been successful.
0218.00045; Former executives say Messrs. Stephenson and Stankey also misjudged the demands of running a media business compared with a telecom business.
0218.00046; The culture clash has been especially stark at Time Warner, where employees were used to calling their former CEO Jeffrey Bewkes by his first name.
0218.00047; AT&T has tried to impose a telephone-company culture on a creative company, a former Time Warner executive said.
0218.00048; A WarnerMedia spokesman said top executives who left the company all departed for different reasons, and he cited a deep pool of writers, directors and other creative talent working for the media unit.
0218.00049; Mr. Stankey, along with his promotion to chief operating officer, remains CEO of WarnerMedia.
0218.00050; He replaced the leaders of HBO, Turner and Warner Bros., seeking to break down fiefs and develop a single strategy. He brought in former NBC programming executive Robert Greenblatt and reduced a 600-person Time Warner corporate office to fewer than 100. Elliott criticized AT&T for pushing out much of the leadership at DirecTV and Time Warner, a sentiment shared by some current and former executives.
0218.00051; AT&T stalwarts disagree, saying key people continue to work at both units.
0218.00052; This week, Mr. Stankey secured a content partnership with Hollywood director and producer J.J. Abrams, who signed with WarnerMedia over other suitors including Apple, a person familiar with the deal said. Mr. Stankey's biggest initiative, a streaming service that can compete with Netflix, as well as new offerings from Apple Inc. and Disney, has yet to launch. Soon after the Time Warner deal closed, Mr. Stankey detailed plans for a three-tiered streaming service with graduated pricing and varied content.
0218.00053; He sought little input from top executives at Warner Bros. and HBO, blind-siding them with the announcement, people familiar with the process said. By June, Mr. Stankey had to backtrack.The three-tier plan was confusing both to the industry and inside the company, and rivals were coming out with simple, single-priced offers.
0218.00054; AT&T now plans one service, called HBO Max, which will include HBO shows and other Warner content, including Friends. It is expected to cost more than $15 a month, according to people familiar with the project.
0218.00055; Inside the company, some executives have been confused by the shifting strategy on streaming.
0218.00056; Strategy sessions for HBO Max in June were supposed to clarify the company's approach.
0218.00057; Yet many who attended left with many questions unanswered on topics that spanned pricing to programming, according to a person familiar with the matter.

0220.00001; May 29, 2019 You've probably heard a lot of talk about Income Share Agreements (ISAs) lately. It's been all over the news , with many students and institutions opting for ISAs in lieu of student loans.
0220.00002; We often share how ISAs make education more accessible and affordable, but what does that really mean?
0220.00003; Allow us to clear up your questions about ISAs: So, what exactly is an ISA? In the realm of education, an Income Share Agreement is established when a school covers a student's tuition upfront and sets up a contract for that student to pay back their tuition with a fixed percentage of their income (for a fixed number of years) after they leave the program. Students at Kenzie only pay back their ISAs once they make at least $40,000/year. Essentially, we don't get paid until you do.
0220.00004; How do ISAs Make Education More Accessible and Affordable? There's no denying that the cost of education can be steep-- especially for those thinking of attending a traditional 4-year university. For many low-income folks in the U.S., getting approved for loans, grants, or having the ability to make incremental payments isn't feasible.
0220.00005; Because ISAs don't require upfront tuition payments, those with lower incomes are provided with a form of equity that allows them to take that first step toward continuing their education and an amazing career. Kenzie Academy students who choose a full ISA pay 17.5% of their monthly earned income for only 4 years. With a Kenzie ISA, once a student has fulfilled their obligation over the 4 years they've completed their education payments.
0220.00006; We believe you shouldn't have to have money to make money.
0220.00007; That's why Kenzie is proud to offer ISAs and invest in our students' success!

0224.00001; By Newinhomes on Sep 13, 2019  With the federal election right around the corner, REALTOR® associations across Canada came together to make recommendations for all levels of government in an effort to make home ownership more attainable for Canadians.
0224.00002; Canadian housing markets vary so much across the country. It hardly makes sense to take a one size fits all approach to balancing the housing market.
0224.00003; Combined, these REALTOR® associations add up to 92,000 REALTORS®, which is about 70% of all the REALTORS® in Canada.
0224.00004; The Edmonton market is extremely different than Toronto's. Nova Scotia is completely different than Vancouver.
0224.00005; But they all agree on one thing - it should be easier to buy a home in Canada.
0224.00006; With increasing pent-up demand and accelerated price growth, recent policies focused on demand such as the mortgage stress test have made home ownership less attainable.
0224.00007; The Ontario government and the City of Toronto are working on solutions to bring more supply on-line, but specific milestones should be set.
0224.00008; The federal election is on October 21. Hopefully the leading candidates take these REALTORS® seriously and run on a platform that prioritizes helping Canadians realize their dreams of home ownership.

0225.00001; Dividend Stocks  Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on Pinterest  Share on LinkedIn  High-yield stocks that pay steadily growing and relatively high dividends tend to do quite well over time.
0225.00002; The current average dividend yield of the S&P 500 is 1.92%, while the long-term average is 2.09%.
0225.00003; After the financial crisis of 2008, the long-term yield value decreased from a peak of 3.86% to around 2% where it is today.
0225.00004; The current average dividend yield is up from a year ago when it was 1.76%. That's a 9% difference. So finding high-yield stocks that can consistently boost their payouts more than a time 9% and have higher dividend yields than 2% should be the goal for income investors.
0225.00005; Such companies tend to have higher than average payout ratios.
0225.00006; They pay out the average 35% of earnings or better to investors.
0225.00007; Below are 5 stocks selling with higher than average dividend yields and whose dividends have been rising 15% or more per year.
0225.00008; The companies have higher than average payout ratios. None of these stocks are turnarounds.
0225.00009; They have been growing consistently for the past several years.
0225.00010; You can rely on them to continue to increase their dividends at these rates.
0225.00011; Compare Brokers  Broadcom (AVGO) Dividend Yield: 3.7%  Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO ) is a semiconductor company that makes a variety of chips used in data centers, set-top boxes, telecom equipment, and smartphones. Earnings have been growing consistently and have beat market expectations. Broadcom stock trades at a low 13x price-to-earnings ratio and has a 3.7% dividend yield.
0225.00012; AVGO pays out about half its earnings in dividends.
0225.00013; Broadcom's dividends have been growing consistently at a high rate over the past 3 years (+74%) and five years (+55%).
0225.00014; Look for AVGO stock to follow this consistent trend.
0225.00015; Broadcom's earnings should do well over the next telecom cycle as 5G equipment begins to roll out.
0225.00016; Compare Brokers  Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP) Dividend Yield: 5.9%  Phillips 66 Partners (NYSE: PSXP ) operates, develops and acquires crude oil, refined petroleum products and natural gas liquids pipelines, terminals and other transportation and midstream assets. PSXP stock sports a 5.9% dividend yield and trades for just 13 times trailing earnings per share. PSXP pays out 83% of its annual earnings in dividends.
0225.00017; Phillips 66 stock is a high-quality master limited partnership with significant growth in the pipeline and terminal volumes expected over the next year. Several new pipelines and terminals are expected to come online during that period.
0225.00018; Its assets are spread across the major shale oil-producing regions in the U.S.  PSXP stock has paid out consistently higher dividends to its shareholders and it should continue doing so. This is because analysts expect its volumes to increase as six projects come online in the next year or two. Another reason is that the U.S. Energy Department has reported continuing growth in U.S. oil output from the Bakken region and other areas where PSXP operates.
0225.00019; Compare Brokers  Shell Midstream Partners (SHLX) Dividend Yield: 8.4%  Shell Midstream Partners (NYSE:SHLX) owns and operates energy pipelines and terminals.
0225.00020; The company transports and stores crude oil, natural gas, and refinery gas products in the Gulf Coast and Midwest.
0225.00021; SHLX stock has increased its dividend 23% on average over the past four years.
0225.00022; Shell Midstream stock has a high dividend yield at 8.4%.
0225.00023; SHLX stock's yield is high since it pays out over 100% of its earnings, using debt and asset sales to fund the overage. This will allow SHLX stock to continue its good track record in dividend increases.
0225.00024; Compare Brokers  Delta Air Lines (DAL) Dividend: 2.8%  Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL ) has increased its dividend by over 27% on average over the past three years and 36% over 5 years. The stock is a general play on economic growth as well as its moves to diversify earnings. Delta's recent Q2 revenues were up 9% year-over-year.
0225.00025; Earnings shot up an incredible 32%. Analysts are especially optimistic about the new credit card that DAL is going to co-brand in partnership with American Express (NYSE: AXP ).
0225.00026; Delta stock has an above-average dividend yield. With the DAL stock dividend rate at $1.61, the pay-out ratio is just 22%. So there is plenty of room for the company to continue to increase the dividend.
0225.00027; OKE stock pays a very healthy dividend of 4.7% and pays out 93% of its earnings as dividends.
0225.00028; OKE has $5.5 billion of projects under construction, including a number that will be completed soon.
0225.00029; These will help support the OKE stock dividends.
0225.00030; OKE stock has increased its dividends on average over 13% annual for the past 3 and 5 years.
0225.00031; Its distributable cash flow more than covers its cash dividend payments.
0225.00032; OKE's debt is under control with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.2 times.
0225.00033; Investors can expect OKE stock to continue to raise its dividend over the next several years at a similar rate in 2019.

0227.00004; Technicals  Investors will be paying extra close attention to company earnings reports during this current season. With stocks bordering on all-time highs, any substantial earnings beats may propel stocks to even greater heights.
0227.00005; On the flip side, stocks that may be overvalued could see a significant correction if earnings disappoint.
0227.00006; Every earnings season has its share of big winners and big losers.
0227.00007; Trying to project the stocks that will post large beats for the quarter can be tricky.
0227.00008; Even if the research points to a company handily beating on the earnings front, the stock may not always react as expected.
0227.00009; Trading around earnings reports can get quite dicey for even the most seasoned investors.
0227.00010; In taking a look at some other notable technicals, BP Midstream Partners LP (NYSE:BPMP)'s ROIC is 0.123123.

0227.00013; Companies may issue new shares and buy back their own shares.
0227.00014; This may occur at the same time.

0227.00016; BP Midstream Partners LP (NYSE:BPMP) has a current MF Rank of 7461. Developed by hedge fund manager Joel Greenblatt, the intention of the formula is to spot high quality companies that are trading at an attractive price.

0227.00018; In general, companies with the lowest combined rank may be the higher quality picks.
0227.00019; We can now take a quick look at some historical stock price index data.
0227.00020; BP Midstream Partners LP (NYSE:BPMP) presently has a 10 month price index of 0.90712. The price index is calculated by dividing the current share price by the share price ten months ago.
0227.00021; A ratio over one indicates an increase in share price over the period.
0227.00022; A ratio lower than one shows that the price has decreased over that time period.
0227.00023; Looking at some alternate time periods, the 12 month price index is 0.81624, the 24 month is 0.94313, and the 36 month is 0.94313. Narrowing in a bit closer, the 5 month price index is 0.98074, the 3 month is 0.95089, and the 1 month is currently 0.98217.
0227.00024; The C-Score is a system developed by James Montier that helps determine whether a company is involved in falsifying their financial statements. The C-Score is calculated by a variety of items, including a growing difference in net income verse cash flow, increasing days outstanding, growing days sales of inventory, increasing assets to sales, declines in depreciation, and high total asset growth. The C-Score of BP Midstream Partners LP (NYSE:BPMP) is 3.00000.
0227.00025; The score ranges on a scale of -1 to 6. If the score is -1, then there is not enough information to determine the C-Score.
0227.00026; If the number is at zero (0) then there is no evidence of fraudulent book cooking, whereas a number of 6 indicates a high likelihood of fraudulent activity.
0227.00027; The C-Score assists investors in assessing the likelihood of a company cheating in the books.
0227.00028; Investors might be trying to figure out how to play the stock market at current levels.

0230.00020; Maria Luz-Campos
0231.00001; He was the de-facto leader of OPEC and the most respected oilman in Saudi Arabia and on the world stage. So well respected that when crown prince Mohammed bin Salman needed to salvage his credibility after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, it was energy minister Khalid al-Falih who he turned to.
0231.00002; But in a surprise move, he was ousted and replaced by Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, a half-brother of MBS. It is the first time that a member of the ruling Saudi family has been appointed to the post.
0231.00003; Technocrats like al-Falih have always been the nation's choice to run the oil ministry.
0231.00004; Al-Falih was also relieved from his role as chairman of the state-owned oil giant Aramco.
0231.00005; Saudi Arabia has a 13 percent share of the world's petroleum market.
0231.00006; During al-Falih's tenure, he struggled to raise the price of oil to $80.
0231.00007; That price would give Mohammed bin Salman the financial firepower to transform the economy, moving it away from its oil addiction.
0231.00008; It would also enable it to balance its budget and not exhaust foreign reserves on imports.
0231.00009; Oil is crucial to Saudi Arabia.
0231.00010; It accounts for 40 percent of its economy, 70 percent of government revenue and nearly 80 percent of export earnings.
0231.00011; According to Reuters, Saudi export earnings from oil fell from more than $800m a day in April 2014 to less than $300m per day in February 2016 - due to the shale oil boom in the United States.
0231.00012; In June this year, it was earning $400m a day. Saudi Arabia has used everything in its policy toolbox to raise prices.
0231.00013; Al-Falih elicited the help of Russia and other non-OPEC nations to cut production.
0231.00014; Saudi Arabia cut its own production to its lowest level in five years - to no avail. It also needs high oil prices to meet the ambitious $2 trillion valuation for Saudi Aramco's stock market listing early next year.
0231.00015; At the moment, analysts believe the world's most profitable company is worth between $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion.
0231.00016; But MBS wants a higher valuation and on that count al-Falih also failed to deliver.
0231.00017; Saudi Arabia has ambitious investment plans, vision 2030, and other areas and so I think certainly the slow progress, as probably the Saudis would see it, towards achieving a more balanced market and the price increase they would expect to come with that is going to be a big part of what has driven this change, Richard Mallinson, senior analyst and the co-founder of Energy Aspects, tells Counting the Cost.
0231.00018; According to Mallinson, Prince Abdulaziz is very deeply involved in the (oil) industry and is perceived as a safe pair of hands and experienced person when it comes to oil markets. So I think the fact that he is a prince and the fact that he is the half-brother of the crown prince isn't the relevant factor here, it is much more that he is knowledgeable about the portfolio and he is seen as someone who won't rock the boat when it comes to policy, says Mallison.
0231.00019; I don't think we will see a dramatically different policy.
0231.00020; I think we may see a different style of communication perhaps, maybe a move back towards an approach we saw in the past from Saudi Arabia where there was less talk, less comment to the press.
0231.00021; There was a narrower focus on a message that the kingdom wants to communicate to oil markets.
0231.00022; Earlier this year, the California-based utility Pacific Gas and Electric filed for bankruptcy protection as costs related to wildfires ballooned.
0231.00023; It was probably one of the clearest cases of how climate change wiped out a company that had not done enough to prepare for a warming planet. -  Addressing climate change mitigation and addressing climate change adaptation is in the interest of all countries and in the interest of all companies.
0231.00024; Feike Sijbesma, Dutch life sciences company Royal DSM  PG&E faced approximately $30bn in liabilities as a result of its role in the 2017 and 2018 fires.
0231.00025; Federal judge William Alsup blamed the cause of some of the fires on the utility's negligence. The judge also said the utility had paid $4.5bn to shareholders in dividends over the past five years while failing to take adequate safety precautions.
0231.00026; And Germany's car industry is facing up to the threat of losing its crown as the leading centre for production.
0231.00027; A series of missteps - from diesel-cheating scandals to a lack of preparedness for the end of the combustion engine - has left the road open to Uber, Tesla and Chinese electric brands. An industry that employs more than 800,000 people is facing a make-or-break moment.
0231.00028; Both cases raise many questions: Are businesses doing enough to prepare for climate change or do executives have their heads in the sand? Our economics editor Abid Ali talks to Feike Sijbesma, chief executive of Dutch life sciences company Royal DSM, about climate change adaptation and why it is important for businesses - despite a lack of political will from the likes of US President Donald Trump who withdrew from the Paris climate change accord. Germany's BMW has been one of the earlier movers in producing electric cars.
0231.00029; It currently stands fourth behind Tesla and two Chinese companies in terms of sales. Al Jazeera's Dominic Kane speaks with BMW board member Pieter Nota at the Frankfurt Motor Show about BMW's electric car production and other challenges the industry is facing.

0232.00001; New Delhi: The Uttar Pradesh government on Friday decided that its ministers will start paying their own income taxes, ending a four-decade-old practice of the state exchequer shelling out the amount annually for them.
0232.00002; The announcement came after it came to light that the chief minister and the council of ministers do not dip into their own pockets to pay income tax according to provisions of the UP Ministers' Salaries, Allowances and Miscellaneous Act, 1981. The existence of the four-decade-old law, which makes the state government pay the income tax of all ministers, came as a shocker to many. The amount goes to the Income Tax authorities from the state exchequer.
0232.00003; State Finance Minister Suresh Kumar Khanna in a statement on Friday night said the ministers will pay their own income taxes.
0232.00004; The income tax bill till now was paid through the state treasury, he said.
0232.00005; The decision has been taken on the directives of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Khanna said. The chief ministers who saved on their taxes have been from across parties  -  including Adityanath, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Akhilesh Yadav, Mayawati, Kalyan Singh, Ram Prakash Gupta, Rajnath Singh, Sripati Mishra, Vir Bahadur Singh and ND Tiwari. For the last financial year, the state government paid Rs 86 lakh as the ministers' tax bill, a senior finance ministry official said.
0232.00006; There is an act existing from 1981 during VP Singh's time.
0232.00007; Whatever is being done is in pursuance with that Act, Uttar Pradesh Power Minister Shrikant Sharma said earlier on Friday, assuring that the government would look into any suggestion about what could be done about it. A section of the Act says, The salary referred to in sub-sections (1) and (2) shall be exclusive of the tax payable in respect of such salary (including perquisites) under any law relating to income tax for the time being in force, and such tax shall be borne by the state.
0232.00008; It was argued in 1981 that the state government should bear the income tax burden as most ministers were from poor backgrounds and had meagre incomes, a Congress leader and a colleague of the then chief minister VP Singh said.
0232.00009; But over the years, the state has been led by leaders like Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati who is worth Rs 111 crore as per her affidavit for the Rajya Sabha polls in 2012.
0232.00010; Another former chief minister, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav, owns assets worth over Rs 37 crore together with his wife Dimple, according to the affidavit filed for the recent Lok Sabha polls.
0232.00011; According to the affidavit submitted for the Legislative Council elections in 2017, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's assets total Rs 95,98,053.
0232.00012; Senior Congress leader and former MP PL Punia said the provision doesn't seem right and needs review.
0232.00013; The salaries have gone up several times and there appears to be no relevance for this relaxation. It needs reconsideration and withdrawal, Punia, who was principal secretary to Mayawati when she was chief minister, said. Many like BSP leader and former UP finance minister Lalji Verma said they were not aware of the law.
0232.00014; Verma said as far he remembers he used to pay his own taxes.
0232.00015; Social activist Anil Kumar said the news is a shocker for the common man who pays large sums in taxes.
0232.00016; Why should he bear the burden of those who have all the benefits.
0232.00017; Like all of us, they should also pay for themselves instead of putting an extra burden on us, Kumar asked.

0235.00001; At this time, it's my pleasure to turn the floor over to Mr. Brian Baker, CEO.
0235.00002; Sir, the floor is yours.
0235.00003; Brian Baker  Good morning, and thank you for participating in today's call.
0235.00004; I'm Brian Baker, Chief Executive Officer and with me is our Chief Financial Officer, David Wirthlin.
0235.00005; We issued a press release this morning announcing the financial results of our fourth fiscal quarter and full year ended June 30, 2019.
0235.00006; Today, I'll provide a brief commentary and then I'll turn it over to David for a financial report.
0235.00007; I'll follow this up by providing guidance on our 2020 fiscal year.
0235.00008; At the conclusion, we'll have the operator open the phone lines for questions.
0235.00009; I will now ask David to remind you of our reliance on the safe harbor under the federal securities laws.
0235.00010; David Wirthlin  Thank you, Brian.
0235.00011; Before we begin, let me remind you that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our current expectations, plans, projections and financial performance relating to our business. These forward-looking statements reflect our view as of today only, and they involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those discussed today.
0235.00012; Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by our forward-looking statements today are included in our most recent 10-K and other reports filed with the SEC.
0235.00013; We caution you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements we make this morning.
0235.00014; We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements.
0235.00015; Brian Baker  Thank you, David. By way of introduction, I've been with Dynatronics for about 1.5 years. I joined the company in February 2018 to lead Dynatronics' legacy operations in Utah and Tennessee.
0235.00016; In May of this year, my role was expanded to Chief Operating Officer.
0235.00017; I focused a great deal of my time working with key distributors, our direct sales force and operational leaders at each of our locations.
0235.00018; I believe the relationship I have fostered inside and outside the company will make my transition to CEO a natural evolution for employees, vendors and customers. Before I joined Dynatronics, I was Head of Global Operations at SeaSpine in Southern California. I was part of the spinout management team from Integra Lifesciences and consolidated two Integra distribution sites, established operational leadership and information systems for the new organization.
0235.00019; Early in my career, I acquired and grew a company called Physician Industries, which I operated for nearly 14 years before I sold the business to Integra Lifesciences.
0235.00020; My experience with Integra since that time enables me to develop relationships with many of our shareholders and directors, including our largest shareholder, Prettybrook Partners. Today, we are providing the report on our fourth quarter and fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.
0235.00021; Let me start by focusing on a few highlights.
0235.00022; First, we delivered on the most recent sales guidance. We strive to forecast the business accurately, and we are pleased that our fourth quarter and fiscal year sales are in line with the guidance we provided on our last call.
0235.00023; Second, we have been working to improve operational effectiveness and reduce costs.
0235.00024; We've made significant organizational and operational improvements that enabled us to reduce ongoing operating expenses by approximately $1.7 million in fiscal 2019.
0235.00025; Third, the company generated positive cash flow from operations in fiscal 2019.
0235.00026; In the fourth quarter, we had short-term increases in our working capital related to the timing of international sourcing and collections.
0235.00027; This negatively affected cash flow for the quarter. However, for the full year, we generated $326,000 in positive operating cash flow.
0235.00028; Our overall strategy for the company remains steady.
0235.00029; We aim to become the recognized standard in restorative solutions.
0235.00030; In the near term, our focus will be to continue improving our operational performance and to achieve our stated guidance. David will now provide a financial report.
0235.00031; David Wirthlin  Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone.
0235.00032; I am pleased now to review the financial performance during the quarter and briefly cover the year-end results.
0235.00033; Net sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2019, decreased $1.4 million or 8.2% to $15.5 million compared to $16.9 million in the same quarter of the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in sales of our physical therapy and rehabilitation products in both our direct and dealer channels.
0235.00034; Gross profit for the quarter decreased $478,000 or 9.5% to $4.5 million, representing 29.3% of sales compared to $5 million or 29.7% of sales in the same quarter of the prior year. Lower sales was the primary cause of the decrease, reducing gross profit by approximately $414,000.
0235.00035; The decrease in gross margin percentage to 29.3% from 29.7% contributed about $64,000 to the reduction in gross profit.
0235.00036; Selling, general and administrative expenses, which includes research and development, for the quarter decreased approximately $596,000 or 10.9% to $4.9 million compared to $5.5 million in the same quarter of the prior year.
0235.00037; The decrease included lower selling expenses of $231,000, consisting primarily of lower fixed sales management salaries and lower commissions, a decrease of $132,000 in research and development expenses and a decrease of $233,000 in other general and administrative expenses.
0235.00038; Net loss for the quarter was approximately $232,000 compared to net loss of $538,000 in the same quarter of the prior year. For the fiscal year, I'll highlight just a few points.
0235.00039; First, as Brian noted, we delivered on our most recent sales guidance with fiscal year 2019 sales of $62.6 million. Second, we decreased SG&A expenses by $1.7 million and improved our operating profitability by $455,000. And third, we improved our net loss by $681,000.
0235.00040; As of June 30, 2019, we had cash balances of approximately $256,000.
0235.00041; We have an $11 million asset-based line of credit, pursuant to which we had borrowed $6.5 million.
0235.00042; It is worth noting that the June 30 line of credit balance was somewhat elevated. We expect the September 30, 2019, balance to decrease to approximately $5.5 million.
0235.00043; This reflects decreases in our working capital accounts and positive cash flow from operating activities since June 30, offsetting the negative operating cash flow in the fourth quarter.
0235.00044; We currently have availability on our line of credit of about $2.2 million based on our current borrowing base.
0235.00045; This concludes our summary of operating results.
0235.00046; I will now turn the time back to Brian.
0235.00047; Brian Baker  Thank you, David.
0235.00048; In terms of our guidance for fiscal 2020, we expect consolidated net sales to be in the range of $58 million to $62 million.
0235.00049; We expect the distribution of our revenue fee between quarters to align with historical trends.
0235.00050; We historically have not given quarterly guidance. However, with the first quarter nearly complete, we can say we expect fiscal quarter net sales to be in the range of $16.1 million to $16.3 million.
0235.00051; Consistent with the past two fiscal years, we expect to generate positive cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2020 with some volatility in quarters based on working capital changes.
0235.00052; We expect gross margin to be in the 31% range and SG&A to be about 31% of sales for the current fiscal year, including approximately $1.8 million or 3% of sales in noncash charges. We believe there continues to be opportunity to improve in all of our financial metrics.
0235.00053; The number of common shares outstanding as of June 30, 2019, was approximately 8.4 million. We expect our outstanding shares to increase by approximately 140,000 per quarter. Again, this guidance is based on our current operations and does not include the impact of any potential acquisitions.
0235.00054; All guidance is also subject to risk factors and other forward-looking statements and uncertainties contained in our filings with the SEC.
0235.00055; As I've reflected on my time with Dynatronics, I am optimistic about the future of our company and the opportunity we have to grow in the markets we serve.
0235.00056; We have strong brands with excellent reputation in the market, and we are structuring the operations for long-term success.
0235.00057; These changes will require some patience to be fully reflected in our financial statements, but I am confident that we are on the right path.
0235.00058; We will continue to execute on the necessary steps to bring growth back to the business and to deliver on our stated guidance.
0235.00059; We appreciate and thank our investor base and employees for their ongoing support. We're committed to effectively serving our customers by providing restorative products that accelerate optimal health. I will now turn it over to the operator for questions.
0235.00060; Question-and-Answer Session  Operator  [Operator Instructions]. We'll go first to Scott Henry with Roth Capital.
0235.00061; First, 2019, at least through the first half, had some rationalization of revenues or -- which created sort of difficult comps for 2020 because you're still going up against some of that rationalization.
0235.00062; The question is, from an organic revenue standpoint, should we be thinking about 2020 is starting to be a growth, modest growth albeit, but how should we think about the organic growth after factoring in some of the rationalization that's in the comps, but not in this year?
0235.00063; Scott, it's nice to hear you on the call this morning.
0235.00064; Coming to your question, as far as looking at revenue, we would like to reflect you back to what our current guidance is. We believe we got a good plan in place to hit those guidance numbers that we provided. And I do see that there is some areas that we can continue to work on, be more tactical and enhance our customer relationships.
0235.00065; For example, we have the advantage of having a well-known and respected brand in market, and we are leveraging that position to expand our product distribution to establish national distributors and regional dealers. Another question with regards to gross margins, it's somewhat flattish in 2019 and 2020 guidance.
0235.00066; How should we think about the outlook for gross margins long term? And do you still target sort of a corporate goal of improving those even as high as 40% I think I've heard in the past?
0235.00067; How should we think about that?
0235.00068; I, Scott, would again just refer you back to our recent guidance on how we look at margins and how that was reflected and how our plans are. And as you look beyond our guidance on profitability, I would look at it as, in the short term, we're protecting our curved margins by controlling costs and really wouldn't want to go out further than what we have in our guidance.
0235.00069; Scott Henry  Okay. I guess the final question, and I recognize you don't have anything to announce today, but how should we think about the acquisitional environment out there? I mean would you be surprised if you didn't do a deal in 2020?
0235.00070; Or I'm just trying to get a sense of what the environment is like and where in the process you are as far as looking for additional acquisitions.
0235.00071; We have a strong pipeline of companies that we have built up over the years, and we continue to add to that list.
0235.00072; We are in various stages of discussions with several of those companies.
0235.00073; And I would continue to look at it as we maintain a steady approach to our acquisition strategy, and we regard ourselves as value-oriented buyers.
0235.00074; And we'll go next to Nathan Weinstein with Aegis Capital. Nathan Weinstein  Just on the Bird & Cronin and Hausmann, those are acquisitions consummated in 2017.
0235.00075; Do you have any comment to make on how those are performing now that you've had them in the organization for a couple of years? Thanks for the question. We don't report on a division level, and we've kind of moved away from divisional organizational structure, but I can say that we're pleased with the performance of both of those acquisitions.
0235.00076; Nathan Weinstein  And just following up on the prior question where you were discussing the acquisition pipeline.
0235.00077; If you could just maybe make a comment about the environment?
0235.00078; Have the acquisition multiples in the space risen? Are people looking for, I guess, more money for their companies?
0235.00079; Do you have any sort of anecdotal comments you can make on the environment?
0235.00080; David Wirthlin  Yes.
0235.00081; Nathan, I don't think the environment has changed over the last year. It is still the pipeline companies that we did engage with historically.
0235.00082; And again, I'll just reiterate, we're in various stages of conversation with those companies that we're talking with. And then the last question I have, just the $170 million goal of revenue for 2025, is that something that you guys are still thinking of as being attainable for the business? David Wirthlin  Yes.
0235.00083; Our current strategy has not changed at all, Nathan.
0235.00084; We maintain the focus that we put out there in our five year strategic plan.
0235.00085; We are looking to become the recognized standard in restorative solution, and we stated objectives that we do want to grow organically and continue to look for opportunities to expand margin. And again, we look at the acquisitions as part of our growth strategy as well.
0235.00086; Operator  [Operator Instructions].
0235.00087; Mr. Baker, there appears to be no further questions at this time.
0235.00088; I'd like to turn the call back over to you for any closing comments. Brian Baker  Thank you for the questions and for your interest in Dynatronics. If you have any further questions, please direct them to our Investor Relations contact, Jim Ogilvie.
0235.00089; Operator, you may end the call. Operator  Thank you.
0235.00090; And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.
0235.00091; We appreciate your participation.
0235.00092; You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a great day.

0237.00001; 'Nightmare scenario' would see Max jet not flying again Max factor: Arrival time of new Boeing 737 aircraft the main topic of conversation at the Ryanair AGM in Dublin's City North Hotel.
0237.00002; Pictured are group chief executive Michael O'Leary and deputy chairman Stan McCarthy. Photo: Damien Eagers / INM Independent.ie The nightmare scenario for Boeing and other airlines is if the troubled Max jet never flies again, according to Ryanair group chief executive Michael O'Leary.
0237.00003; The nightmare scenario for Boeing and other airlines is if the troubled Max jet never flies again, according to Ryanair group chief executive Michael O'Leary.
0237.00004; It's highly unlikely, but it could be very damaging for air travel, he told shareholders at the airline's annual general meeting yesterday.
0237.00005; Please log in or register with Independent.ie for free access to this article.
0237.00006; Ryanair has 210 of the Boeing Max jets on order and had expected to start receiving deliveries earlier this year.
0237.00007; But following two fatal crashes, the aircraft were grounded all over the world. It's currently looking like the jets won't be in service until early next year at the earliest.
0237.00008; Mr O'Leary said he doesn't think Ryanair will take its first delivery until at best January or February, and that it could slip further by a couple of months.
0237.00009; But he still expects to have 30 in the Ryanair fleet before next summer.
0237.00010; It had originally expected to have about 60 delivered by this time next year.
0237.00011; The airline has also frozen its pre-delivery payments to Boeing for the Max, he said .
0237.00012; Having 30 of the jets in time for next summer would allow Ryanair to fill the schedule it currently has on sale to customers for the season. He warned that if Max deliveries run any later than March, April and May, the carrier would have to take aircraft out of next summer's schedule, which will hit Ryanair's growth.
0237.00013; If it [the Max] flies in North America this side of Christmas, then I think we're pretty secure we'll be back flying by sometime at the end of February, March, said Mr O'Leary. Ryanair has predicated its future growth on the Max aircraft, which will provide significant fuel savings and other economies.
0237.00014; The delay in the aircraft being recertified has also forced Ryanair to seek up to 700 redundancies.
0237.00015; Mr O'Leary said that if the Max was never to return, it would transform the industry.
0237.00016; There would be a shortage of aircraft around the world, airfares will rise and it would be a devastating outcome for the industry and for consumers generally, he said.
0237.00017; Given that it's not dramatic new technology - it's still a 737, and I don't mean to in any way undermine safety issues - it is an aircraft that has had two fatal accidents in a reasonably short period of time, so it does need to be fully addressed, he added.
0237.00018; Mr O'Leary told shareholders that Ryanair doesn't have a 'Plan B' if it didn't ever take delivery of the Max jets.
0237.00019; If we can't take delivery of those aircraft, we can't grow, and if we can't grow it means inevitably there will be far less growth in European aviation, he predicted.
0237.00020; The outcome of that is that prices will rise.
0237.00021; We will make out like bandits for a few years. Shareholders will see in the short-term, superior returns, dividends, buybacks - all that kind of stuff.
0237.00022; But it would be wrong and bad for the medium-term growth of the industry, which fundamentally depends on delivering people low-cost air travel, not high-cost air travel.
0237.00023; The airline boss said that the Max issue is the biggest operating challenge that Ryanair is currently facing.
0237.00024; We are in continuous, on-going dialogue with Boeing, said Mr O'Leary, who added that he also met the European Aviation Safety Agency this week. He also said that Ryanair remains in talks with Boeing about recovering the cost to the carrier of lost traffic and other costs, including it surplus headcount.
0237.00025; However, he said that he remains confident about the Max and that aircraft will transform Ryanair's cost base for the next five to 10 years. He added that Ryanair's senior pilots and chief pilot are very happy with the jet.
0237.00026; I don't think anybody believes in the industry that there's a fundamental safety problem with the aircraft, said Mr O'Leary.
0237.00027; He paid tribute yesterday to Ryanair chairman David Bonderman. He's been chairman since 1996. Yesterday was his last annual general meeting at Ryanair.
0237.00028; Ex-Kerry Group CEO Stan McCarthy takes over the role next year. He's currently deputy chairman at Ryanair.
0237.00029; Mr Bonderman's long tenure has been previously criticised by some shareholders.
0238.00001; 19th Sep 2019  Related topics  Today, the Trussell Trust has published its new #5WeeksTooLong: why we need to end the wait for Universal Credit report.
0238.00002; This new research shows that in areas where Universal Credit has been rolled out for at least a year, food banks in their network have seen a 30% increase in demand.
0238.00003; JRF responds to Trussell Trust report on Universal Credit  Responding to these findings, Iain Porter, policy & partnerships manager at the independent Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said:  Universal Credit has the potential to be a force for good in our society, but the current design of the system is stifling its ability to provide the support families need.
0238.00004; For millions of people, every day feels like they are constantly swimming against the tide, at risk of being pulled under by the powerful currents of low pay, high rents or an unexpected bill.
0238.00005; The Trussell Trust is right that there is nothing compassionate or just about the initial five week wait for Universal Credit. Nor can we stand by while the system is forcing families to turn to foodbanks when it should be helping to end the need for them.
0238.00006; We estimate that 2 in 5 families yet to move onto Universal Credit will be unable to meet basic living costs during the five week wait.
0238.00007; The Government has a responsibility to go beyond sticking plaster solutions to this problem by ending the immoral five week wait.
0238.00008; Ministers have shown a willingness to take action before to correct flaws in the system, they must do so again if Universal Credit is to provide a reliable lifeline to families when they hit hard times.
0238.00009; JRF is calling on the Government to:  Make the option of fortnightly payments available to everyone from the start of a Universal Credit claim.
0238.00010; Urgently introduce an upfront non-repayable grant aimed at those most in need of support. Alongside this a two-week run-on of child tax credit should be introduced to help families with children.
0238.00011; Incorporate greater flexibility for claimants around repaying an Advance under Universal Credit or backdating their claim, so no one is pulled deeper into poverty or destitution

0240.00001; Ryanair  Ryanair boss could get €100m bonus despite shareholder revolt Michael O'Leary may benefit from fixed-price shares after 50.5% remuneration approval  Gwyn Topham Transport correspondent  @GwynTopham  The Ryanair group chief executive, Michael O'Leary.
0240.00002; Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA  Almost half of Ryanair shareholders have voted against a controversial new pay package for the chief executive, Michael O'Leary, that could result in the airline handing him a €100m (£89m) bonus within five years.
0240.00003; A wafer-thin majority, 50.5%, approved the remuneration report at Ryanair's annual meeting in Dublin, which means O'Leary could land the extraordinary windfall despite widespread shareholder dissent. O'Leary's current pay and annual bonus will be halved to a total maximum €1m a year. However, he will have an option to buy 10m shares at a fixed price of €11.12 a share, should the airline either record €2bn profit in any one year by 2024, or should the share price rise above €21.
0240.00004; In the latter scenario, O'Leary's options would be worth at least €99m.
0240.00005; Both targets are stretching but appear far from unattainable.
0240.00006; The airline's share price is currently just under €10 but was as high as €18.6 in 2017. Ryanair made profits of €1.45bn in 2018. O'Leary was paid a total package of €3.4m with bonus and shares.
0240.00007; His current stake in Ryanair, with 3.9% of the total stock, is worth around €400m. Under a new company structure, O'Leary is the group chief executive of Ryanair Holdings, above four airline chief executives running the main Dublin-based European carrier, Ryanair UK, which has been hived off ahead of Brexit, and two other subsidiaries, Laudamotion and Ryanair Sun. About 30% of shareholders also voted against the re-election of Howard Millar  -  the chair of the remuneration committee  -  and Ryanair's chairman, David Bonderman, who has already announced his intention to step down.
0240.00008; Ryanair has struggled with industrial relations in recent months and its growth plans have been curbed by the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max, delaying the first deliveries this summer of an order for 135 of the planes.
0240.00009; Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  Pilots in the UK started a further seven days of strikes on Wednesday.
0240.00010; Ryanair said that 96% of its flights departed on time, with any delays due to air traffic issues.
0240.00011; The strikes had not caused cancellations, the airline said.
0240.00012; It is bringing in contractors and flying in pilots from other European countries in an effort to maintain its services.
0240.00013; The Balpa union said on Thursday that Ryanair told pilots that benefits would be removed should they take part in the strike, in a standoff that shows little sign of abating.
0240.00014; Ryanair said it remained open to meeting, but Balpa said Ryanair had refused to go to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) for talks.
0240.00015; Balpa's general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: Instead of seeking to resolve the current impasse via negotiation, Ryanair seems hell-bent on prolonging the dispute by threatening pilots with the removal of staff travel benefits and inflated and draconian deductions from salary.

0241.00001; LONDON (Reuters)  -  London Stock Exchange Group Chief Executive David Schwimmer said he feels very good about the proposed $27 billion acquisition of data and analytics company Refinitiv, in which Thomson Reuters has a minority stake.
0241.00002; Last week, the LSE rebuffed a proposed $39 billion takeover bid from rival Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, which vowed to press on with its proposal by speaking directly to the London bourse's shareholders.
0241.00003; Thomson Reuters, a professional information company that is the parent of Reuters News, holds a 45% stake in Refinitiv.
0241.00004; Schwimmer said two big drivers of change going forward are the increasing importance of data and multi-asset class investment strategies. We think that the Refinitiv transaction is a very strong fit strategically from that perspective, and really positions the London Stock Exchange Group very well to take advantage of growth in these areas, Schwimmer told a conference held by derivatives industry body ISDA.
0241.00005; I don't think there is a lot of controversy around the increasing importance and focus on data.
0241.00006; Refinitiv brings content and distribution on a global basis that would be transformational for the LSE, raising recurring revenues and lowering exposure to volatile market transaction volumes, Schwimmer said.
0241.00007; It's a transaction that we feel very good about, said Schwimmer, a 20-year veteran of Goldman Sachs bank who became CEO of the LSE last August. (Reporting by Huw Jones, editing by Deepa Babington and Jon Boyle)

0242.00006; Expensive new machinery and international competition transformed farming from a sleepy vocation handed down between generations to international global commerce driven by technology and sophisticated business metrics. Farming became a real business.
0242.00007; Small farms disappeared as expensive machinery demanded economies of scale that could create a sufficient return on capital investment.
0242.00008; International competition lowered prices to where new technology was required to compete with lower-cost international labor. Farmers needed to raise the level of planning beyond pushing seeds into the ground and waiting for favorable weather.
0242.00009; They began to pay attention to detailed yield metrics and weather patterns, planning irrigation to effectively use natural rain patterns.
0242.00010; They used Monte Carlo simulations to plan which crops to plant and sell. The ones who didn't change went bankrupt or sold and retired.
0242.00011; Musicians held a concert, Farm AID, to call attention to the farmer's plight.
0242.00012; Driving to work this morning, I realized that changes in the CPA industry parallel the plight of the small farmer in the 1980s.
0242.00013; Solo and small firms face fundamentally the same challenges small farmers faced in the 1980s.
0242.00014; Competition disrupts pricing and profitability in traditional service areas.
0242.00015; Foreign competition from outsourcing demands lower labor costs at the same time domestic employees are increasingly expensive and in short supply.
0242.00016; Expensive new technology demands sufficient scale to create a sufficient return on investment. The best tax and accounting technology is too expensive for small firms.
0242.00017; Yet small firms need efficiency boosts most.
0242.00018; The hot-off-the-internet presses Accounting Firm Operations and Technology Survey from industry tech gurus Randy Johnston and Brian Tankersley rips the band-aid off the coming pain and disruption solo and small firms will suffer over the next decade. Who makes the technology acquisition decisions for solo and small firms?
0242.00019; The survey suggests partners and maybe firm administrators make these decisions.
0242.00020; Of course, the decisions are limited by their tech knowledge, which is likely to be lacking compared to IT professionals and even tech partners in larger firms.
0242.00021; The survey shows that solo and small firms don't even use IT consultants extensively. How informed can these decisions be? We can logically conclude solo and small firms will fall even further behind in technology, which impacts their ability to compete in commoditizing traditional markets.
0242.00022; From the survey, solo practitioners rate understanding new technology as a bigger challenge than attracting new clients.
0242.00023; Small firms rank practice improvement as their number two challenge.
0242.00024; That's really just a proxy for identifying the right tech solutions.
0242.00025; In the survey, solo and small firms rate examining technology to solve workflow inefficiencies as their second most effective way to control costs. Yet, how can they do that with limited knowledge? Avoiding the issue by selling at retirement won't work.
0242.00026; The survey also shows that the likely suitors for small firms, medium-sized firms, aren't that interested.
0242.00027; Less than 20% of medium firms believe firm acquisitions are an effective way to generate revenue.
0242.00028; Show that to the broker, who tells you that you'll get a 1.2 collections multiple on your sole proprietorship.
0242.00029; I had lunch recently with a CPA firm owner, who had made four recent acquisitions. He told me that the maximum multiple he paid was 0.8 times.
0242.00030; He avoids any firm that has brokered up. They don't know the reality of the declining value of 1040 practices. If selling and retiring isn't a solution, what is?
0242.00031; Rather than listening to vendors and consultants, who have never worked five minutes in a CPA firm, maybe we can generate the solutions ourselves.
0242.00032; We need a new type of vendor/consultant, who brings solutions from experienced CPA's to other CPA's. Effective practice management arises from interdependent components:  Workflow Software Human resource management  We need a new type of vendor/consultant, who can marshal resources to solve challenges with all three components.
0242.00033; Good workflow means nothing without good software.
0242.00034; Good software means nothing without a good workflow.
0242.00035; Both workflow and software fail in the face of poor staff management.
0242.00036; Our current vendors know little about the day-to-day grind of solo and small firms.
0242.00037; At best, they are great software developers. At worst, they are international conglomerates, who had the misfortune of acquiring companies serving CPA firms.
0242.00038; They have no emotional investment in our success or our clients. They haven't known the joy and challenge of preparing thousands of tax returns in a small firm.
0242.00039; They couldn't care less about the small businesses, who depend on small CPA firms for advice that literally keeps small businesses open. These vendors provide training led by product specialists, who know every little bit of product functionality but have zero knowledge leveraging the features for small firm success.
0242.00040; They know the software, but not workflow or people management. They address an isolated piece of the practice improvement equation. Our version of Farm AID won't be led by musicians.
0242.00041; Our plight just isn't as tears-worthy as farmers. Our version of CPA AID won't be a concert.
0242.00042; It will be support for CPA's by other CPA's.
0242.00043; Start by following the advice from our industry visionaries like Randy Johnston, Brian Tankersley, Donny Shimamoto, and Ed Mendlowitz.
0242.00044; Then demand solutions from vendors with real-world experience running CPA firms. John Mellencamp won't be writing a song that will solve our problems. We'll write that song ourselves.

0245.00001; How many times a year do you plan on putting some cash in your savings account, but instead you get hit with a bill that seems to pop out of nowhere? Or how often do you find yourself scrambling to pay for a large, but predictable expense like new car tires? Probably more times than you would like to admit.
0245.00002; And most likely, many of these situations come with a bit of stress.
0245.00003; Stressful thoughts like how am I ever going to pay this bill? Or I just can't get ahead - how am I ever going to get control of my finances? It's not fun and can feel like your money is controlling you instead of the other way around.
0245.00004; This is where the good old sinking fund comes to the rescue. Sinking funds are one of the best things that I could have done for myself.
0245.00005; They have allowed me take control of my finances. And, as a result, I feel less stress around money.
0245.00006; I strongly believe they are one of the core components to setting yourself up for financial success.
0245.00007; Let's take a look at what sinking funds are and how we can use them to feel at ease with our finances. A sinking fund is a way to gradually, but consistently, save for an expected future expense.
0245.00008; Sinking funds can be used to save up money for just about anything that you foresee needing money for in the future.
0245.00009; This could be things like the holiday season, back-to-school shopping, a new tv, medical bills or car repairs.
0245.00010; When it comes time to pay an expected expense, you can turn to your sinking fund to get you through the expense pain free. It's a pretty liberating feeling.
0245.00011; Sinking funds are simple in theory.
0245.00012; You set money aside on a regular basis to pay for your expenses and the things you want in your life.
0245.00013; For example, I pay my car and homeowners insurance once a year. And it's a pretty hefty bill of over $1600! I don't want to be scrambling to come up with $1600 when I get the bill once a year so I set aside $133 each month into my insurance sinking fund.
0245.00014; It's an amazing feeling when the bill comes to be able to pay the bill in full stress free. So you may be thinking, I have an emergency fund so why would I need sinking funds for some of these expenses?
0245.00015; The big difference is that the emergency fund is money that is set aside for exactly that - an emergency.
0245.00016; But what constitutes as an emergency?
0245.00017; The best way to tell if something is an emergency or not is to ask yourself, do I expect this expense to occur?
0245.00018; Do you expect to get into a car accident? No  Do you expect that a 15 year old air conditioner will die soon?
0245.00019; Yes  Do you expect to pay your annual car registration or insurance? Yes  Every time you say yes to these questions, it's a sign that a sinking fund could help you mitigate the stress of dealing with the large, but expected, expense.
0245.00020; As it turns out, an emergency fund is simply a type of sinking fund that is established to pay for those unexpected situations.
0245.00021; Now that we know what a sinking fund is and is not, let's take a look at why it's the game changer of personal finance.
0245.00022; Save  I didn't expect to run out of wine so soon, but I stayed strong and didn't dip into my emergency fund to buy more. Why are Sinking Funds Important for your personal finances?
0245.00023; Let's say your 20 year old furnace breaks down in the dead of a Midwestern winter.
0245.00024; Obviously you have to repair your furnace. If you don't have a sinking fund set up for your old ass furnace, you may find yourself having to take on debt to buy a new furnace.
0245.00025; But if you have a sinking fund already set up, knowing that furnaces eventually break down, then you have set yourself up to buy a new furnace without going into debt.
0245.00026; Let's look at the same example as above - the broke ass furnace causing you problems in the coldest part of winter.
0245.00027; Only this time, you haven't set up a sinking fund.
0245.00028; In this case, you really don't want to go into debt to pay for the repairs, so you search your budget to find the money elsewhere. In your search, you find a vacation fund you started for a big trip you want to take next year.
0245.00029; You then decide that the vacation will just have to wait and then use the money to buy a new furnace.
0245.00030; It's beyond frustrating when you have to steal money from another priority to pay for something, especially when you could have predicted the expense.
0245.00031; When you have a stash of cash tucked away for that washing machine that has been making horrendous noises, you are not even going to bat an eye when the darn thing finally craps out on you. You will be able to head straight to that hardware store, and pick yourself out a new one without worrying where the money is going to come from or how you are going to wash your clothes.
0245.00032; This in turn reduces your stress around money.
0245.00033; With a sinking fund there is no reason to stress about where they money is going to come from to allow you to wash clothes at home again.
0245.00034; Purposefully and gradually saving for something helps you make intentional purchases.
0245.00035; When you make an effort to put away a bit of money each month for a new video game system, you won't feel guilty when you finally bring it home.
0245.00036; This is because the money spent was intentionally saved for buying a video game system.
0245.00037; It wasn't an impulse buy which is usually the reason we feel guilty about a purchase.
0245.00038; Now that we understand how much of a game changer sinking funds can be for your personal finances and as a stress reducer, let's take a look at some sinking funds that might be helpful to start right away.
0245.00039; Save  I got this kickass gravy boat using my gravy boat sinking fund.
0245.00040; I started this sinking fund on my 4th birthday and finally saved enough for the gravy boat of my dreams.
0245.00041; Everyone's sinking funds will be different. Don't stress out about trying to figure out all of the sinking funds you need right away. It took me a few years of unexpected expenses popping up to have a good handle on what sinking funds I needed to establish.
0245.00042; Here are a few ideas to get you started:  Insurance Premiums (if not monthly)  New Car Fund (this one is a game changer to avoid a future car loan)  Car Maintenance  Home Maintenance  Vacations  Home Furnishings  Pet medical expenses  Annual subscriptions (Amazon, Costco, Sam's Club, etc)  Extracurricular activities for yourself and/or kids  Gift giving for holidays, birthdays, weddings, etc  Back-to-school supplies and clothes  Out-of-pocket medical expenses  Anything you want to save up for! TV, Video games, new bike, etc  You may be thinking…..ok, all of these sinking funds sound great and they could really help me get my finances in order, but how do I find the money to start funding all of them?. The answer to that is You don't  As with most things, I suggest starting slow.
0245.00043; Start by focusing on the non-monthly bills that you know will pop up first whether you like it or not.
0245.00044; Things like your insurance premiums, car registration, etc.
0245.00045; Figure out how much your annual bill will be and each month add 1/12th of that amount to the fund. That way when the bill is due, you have a stash of cash to pay it off worry free.
0245.00046; Once you get a handle on creating and funding sinking funds for your non-monthly bills you can start to add more sinking funds for your other priorities. This is where sinking funds start to be fun!
0245.00047; Save  As a person who likes numbers, the choice for my first sinking fund was simple: my calculator of the month club.
0245.00048; Got this little beauty in December of 1987.  There are many ways to organize your sinking funds.
0245.00049; When I only had a few sinking funds, I kept separate savings accounts for each one.
0245.00050; But as I increased the number of sinking funds, this became too hard to manage. The key is to find a way that is simple and works for you.
0245.00051; Something that you can stick with. For me, I use YNAB (You need a Budget) to help keep track of my sinking funds.
0245.00052; YNAB allows me to put all of my sinking funds in one savings account, while still being able to see how much money I have allocated to each of my sinking funds.
0245.00053; Other options for keeping track of your sinking funds are:  Use a spreadsheet  Keep a cash envelope for each of your sinking funds  How do you know how much to put in sinking funds each month?
0245.00054; You are now armed with the list of sinking funds you want to start and how to keep track of them, but how do you know how much to put in each month?
0245.00055; For annual bills where you know the exact amount, divide the bill by 12 to give you the amount to add each month so that you have enough to pay the bill in full when it comes due.
0245.00056; If it's a quarterly expense, divide the bill by 4.
0245.00057; You get the picture.
0245.00058; For expenses where you don't know the exact amount, like car maintenance or out-of-pocket medical expense, estimate how much you think you'll need and divide it by the number of months before you'll need the money.
0245.00059; When I first started using sinking funds to help manage my finances there were a few stumbles along the way. The concept of sinking funds is simple, but I've learned it takes patience, trial-and-error and commitment. Here are some of the learnings I had when I first started my adventure with sinking funds.
0245.00060; Stashing away a few dollars every month to pay for upcoming bills and priorities sounds simple in theory, but when it actually came down to doing it I consistently struggled. Sure, I had plans to put $100 dollars towards my car maintenance fund. But I wasn't going to bring my car in for a few months, so I bought a new shirt or three instead.
0245.00061; These were the types of decisions I was frequently making and they prevented me from funding my sinking funds.
0245.00062; Fortunately, there finally came a time when I realized that if these sinking funds were going to work for me I had to make them a priority. And to do this, I applied the pay yourself first rule to my sinking funds.
0245.00063; Pay Yourself First - Make saving a non-negotiable, just like paying your rent or mortgage each month.
0245.00064; This way, rather than thinking about saving after you've paid all of your expenses, save first before it gets eaten up by other expenses or you're tempted to spend it.
0245.00065; Making my sinking funds a priority and funding them before I allocated money to my discretionary accounts, like going out to eat, helped me finally fill them up.
0245.00066; It took making them a non-negotiable for them to actually serve their purpose and reduce my stress around money.
0245.00067; I had to learn to be patient.
0245.00068; I suck at being patient.
0245.00069; Slowly saving up for a new computer can be excruciating.
0245.00070; I was accustomed to buying things when I wanted, no matter if I had the money saved for it or not.
0245.00071; I would figure out a way to pay for it when the credit card bill arrived, right?
0245.00072; And I did find the money, but not without a little stress.
0245.00073; Adopting a save before you buy it mentality was difficult, and it took patience and remembering how waiting until I saved enough money was helping me stick to my money goals.
0245.00074; After a year or so of making sinking funds a part of my money plan, I started to feel their benefits.
0245.00075; There was minimal stress around paying bills and I didn't feel guilty when I made a purchase with money I purposely stashed away in a sinking fund.
0245.00076; It was amazing and made learning to apply some patience worth it. The I forgot to create a sinking fund for this sinking fund For the first few years of managing my money with sinking funds, I was constantly getting hit with bills that I forgot to create sinking funds for.
0245.00077; It was frustrating, but after awhile I learned all the things I needed to create sinking funds for.
0245.00078; So my advice to anyone starting off with sinking funds, in order to prevent this frustration, is to create a sinking fund for things you forgot.
0245.00079; How much you want to put in this account is up to you, but I found it beneficial to make a sinking fund with $100 in it for those darn expenses that slipped my mind, like my Amazon Prime subscription.
0245.00080; Save  I ALWAYS remember to buy my dog a birthday present, but it's the lavish annual party that I always forget about. Sinking funds are a great tool to use to help you feel less stress around your finances.
0245.00081; They allow you to feel prepared and ready to take on the expenses of life.
0245.00082; But they won't magically appear overnight. They take time to fund, and patience and commitment is key. If you keep at it, slowly but surely you will have established and funded a plethora of sinking funds.
0245.00083; They will become your best friends, relieving you of the stress your living expenses can often throw at you.
0245.00084; They will also allow you to fund your priorities, such as a great vacation, guilt free.
0245.00085; So go ahead, pick a few sinking funds to start with.
0245.00086; Figure out how much to add to them each month and slowly start to feel the anxiety around money fade.
0245.00087; You got this.

0246.00001; B.C. Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson Sept. 24 called on Premier John Horgan to restore the Rural Dividend Fund that many interior communities rely on for development in infrastructure needs.
0246.00002; Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development Doug Donaldson announced earlier this month a $69 million support package for workers displaced in the forestry sector downturn.
0246.00003; article continues below  What he left out, Wilkinson said, is that the funding came partially from the suspension of the $25 million fund.
0246.00004; The previous Liberal government established the fund to strengthen and diversify smaller communities. It has provided some $73 million to communities, First Nations and organizations over time.
0246.00005; But, Wilkinson called the transition program half-baked. This is an insult to every single community that has lost its primary forestry employment, and now the NDP is taking away their only real hope of diversification, he said.
0246.00006; Donaldson, however, said the government made a decision that workers affected by temporary or permanent mill closures need help so they could remain in their communities.
0246.00007; That's why we temporarily repurposed the funding in the Regional Development Program just to fund in part the $69 million.
0246.00008; But, say leaders in those communities, their development and community health are threatened by the financial hit.
0246.00009; Williams Lake Mayor Walt Cobb said his city was going to use funds to build a water treatment plant as the community is on a boil-water order due to manganese contamination.
0246.00010; That plan is now on hold. Horgan said Cobb could have called him to discuss the infrastructure project. We'll certainly be working with Williams Lake on that significant investment, Horgan said.
0246.00011; There are other places where that funding can be accessed.
0246.00012; Lumby Mayor Kevin Acton said the program had been used to do planning and economic diversification work.
0246.00013; This has been a devastating blow to our community, Acton said. Fort Nelson regional District Coun. Danny Soles said the funds are being used to help people with the same problems people in his region are already experiencing.
0246.00014; We need things like the R&D for development purposes, he said.
0246.00015; MLA for Cariboo-Chilcotin and opposition critic for rural development Donna Barnett called rural communities the backbone of the province.
0246.00016; For this government to take this away from our rural communities, to take them backward, is absolutely disgraceful, Barnett said.
0246.00017; She said the funding removal would alienate small communities, drive away economic growth and put towns at risk.
0246.00018; The Prince George-based United Steelworkers Local 1-2017 said the Liberals and mayors shouldn't be questioning help being given to out-of-work employees in affected communities.
0246.00019; These same people have been slamming government for not taking action to assist forest workers and communities, local president  Brian O'Rourke said.
0246.00020; What they're saying now makes no sense. This funding diversion will be grouped with additional funding to help dozens of affected communities and thousands of workers and families in the forest sector.
0246.00021; He said thousands of workers are currently not earning an income, a similar situation to 2009 when thousands of forest workers received financial assistance to get through that economic downturn under the then-Liberal government.
0246.00022; We fully support the government's current actions to assist forest workers, O'Rourke said. It may mean a short term setback for local special projects, but this funding will by far reach and benefit more workers and communities through these challenging times.

0247.00001; iYab  German prosecutors dealt a blow to Volkswagen's efforts to put the 2015 emissions-cheating case behind it, charging the automaker's chief executive, chairman and former CEO with stock manipulation for not telling investors at the time that the scandal was about to break.
0247.00002; The charges announced Tuesday could pose a major distraction for CEO Herbert Diess as he pushes ahead with the company's shift toward zero-emissions vehicles and a new, more environmentally friendly image.
0247.00003; FILE  -  Hans Dieter Poetsch, chairman of the board of directors of the Volkswagen car maker company, attends the annual shareholders meeting in Hanover, Germany, May 10, 2017.
0247.00004; Diess, Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch and former CEO Martin Winterkorn were accused of deliberately informing markets too late about the huge costs to VW that would result from the scandal, which erupted when regulators discovered that millions of diesel cars had been fitted with software designed to thwart pollution tests. Winterkorn was previously charged in the scandal itself. Poetsch and Diess had not faced charges until now.
0247.00005; Volkswagen called the new allegations groundless and threw its support behind Poetsch and Diess.
0247.00006; But the case could require Diess to spend time on his defense at a crucial time for the company.
0247.00007; FILE  -  CEO of Volkswagen Herbert Diess introduces the new VW ID.3 at the IAA Auto Show in Frankfurt, Germany, Sept. 9, 2019. Just days ago, Diess stood on stage at the Frankfurt Motor Show with the company's new battery-powered vehicle, the ID.3, and showed off a new version of the VW logo to underscore the automaker's transformation. The new car is aimed at bringing zero-emissions driving to the masses.
0247.00008; The vehicle is supposed to be carbon-dioxide neutral throughout its production chain. Tido Park, a lawyer for Diess, told German news agency dpa that the indictment won't prevent Diess from performing his duties as CEO. It is not unprecedented for a German CEO to continue while fending off charges.
0247.00009; Deutsche Bank's Josef Ackermann had to spend two days a week in 2004 defending himself against breach-of-trust charges in connection with his duties as a board member at mobile phone company Mannesmann.
0247.00010; He was acquitted.
0247.00011; Prosecutors said Winterkorn knew of the impending scandal and the potential financial damage since at least May 2015, Poetsch since late June of that year, and Diess since late July, less than a month after he became head of the company's VW brand. The scandal broke when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency went public with it in mid-September 2015.
0247.00012; That led to a drop in the automaker's stock. The charges could bring up to five years in prison, authorities said.
0247.00013; FILE  -  Martin Winterkorn is seen prior a presentation at the IAA Frankfurt Auto Show in Frankfurt, Germany, Sept. 17, 2015. Winterkorn resigned shortly after the scandal erupted.
0247.00014; Poetsch was chief financial officer at the time and became chairman in late 2015.
0247.00015; Winterkorn was succeeded as CEO by Matthias Mueller, who was then replaced by Diess in April 2018.
0247.00016; Volkswagen's board said that based on expert legal advice, it had anticipated a negotiated settlement with the EPA and did not expect the agency to announce a violation. VW said that before the EPA announcement, management had no concrete evidence that would have made immediate notification of the capital markets necessary.
0247.00017; As a result, the board said, the successful work with the chairman and the CEO should be continued. Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen, said the charges could be more of a concern for Poetsch, since he was finance chief, while Diess was only indirectly involved.
0247.00018; Volkswagen stock fell 1.9 percent after the news. Illegal software  Volkswagen admitted installing software that turned on pollution controls when vehicles were being tested and switched them off during everyday driving.
0247.00019; That made it look as if the cars met tough U.S. limits on pollutants known as nitrogen oxides.
0247.00020; In all, some 11 million cars worldwide were equipped with the illegal software. The scandal has cost Volkswagen more than 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in fines, recall costs and civil settlements.
0247.00021; The automaker apologized and pleaded guilty in the U.S., where two executives were sentenced to prison and six others, including Winterkorn, were charged, though they could not be extradited.
0247.00022; Separately, German prosecutors in April charged Winterkorn and four others with fraud in the emissions scandal. Prosecutors alleged that Winterkorn knew about the software since at least May 2015.
0247.00023; Legal proceedings are still going on.

0248.00001; Walters: Will two new laws push California to its tipping point?
0248.00002; During several changes of ownership and names, it continued to make belts in a factory in San Francisco's Bayview District, the largest manufacturing facility remaining in the city.
0248.00003; However, earlier this month, Circa announced that it was closing its plant, laying off 92 employees and moving its headquarters to Atlanta.
0248.00004; Due to changing economic conditions in the city and globally as well as a shifting customer base, Circa of America has made the business decision to move, a Circa spokeswoman told the San Francisco Chronicle. Circa had reached its tipping point, when the disadvantages of operating in San Francisco outweighed the advantages.
0248.00005; A two-hour drive to the southeast, Jim deMartini had already reached his tipping point. A prominent farmer and Stanislaus County supervisor, deMartini announced in July that he was not only giving up his political position, but had sold his 1,100 acres of farmland and was moving to Nevada.
0248.00006; Not for business reasons.
0248.00007; I've had it with California, deMartini said.
0248.00008; Circa apparently isn't alone.
0248.00009; Joseph Vranich, who helps businesses relocate, has published a report, entitled Why Companies Leave California, claiming that between 2008 and 2016, at least 13,000 companies moved out of state during that nine-year period. Vranich says high taxes and increasingly onerous regulatory laws are the major reasons for business departures.
0248.00010; DeMartini isn't alone either.
0248.00011; California routinely loses more people to other states than it gains, with Texas the No. 1 destination of ex-Californians. There are numerous anecdotal reports of wealthy people, such as deMartini, quietly opting to relocate to no- or low-tax states such as Nevada and Texas as their tax burdens increase.
0248.00012; The larger question is whether California as a whole could reach a tipping point when high taxes, regulation, soaring housing, utility and fuel costs, choking traffic congestion, disease-ridden encampments of the homeless and other negative factors overwhelm the positives of living and doing business here and the state begins to experience economic and social erosion.
0248.00013; We have seen tipping points in California before, both positive and negative.
0248.00014; We saw the San Francisco Bay Area explode as a generator of jobs and wealth when technical innovation, venture capital and entrepreneurial spirit combined in just the right proportions.
0248.00015; We saw Los Angeles County implode when the end of the Cold War ravaged its aerospace industry and more than a million people fled the region, leaving it with the worst poverty in a state with the nation's worst poverty. What might be California's tipping point?
0248.00016; Could it be one or more of the bills just passed in the Legislature?
0248.00017; Could it be Assembly Bill 5, which would, by codifying a state Supreme Court decision, force businesses to place more workers on their payrolls, rather than treat them as contractors? Could it be Assembly Bill 1482, which imposes limits on rents in older apartment houses?
0248.00018; Or could it be one of the measures that voters might face next year to raise property taxes on commercial real estate or boost income taxes on the highest income Californians?
0248.00019; We may not be there yet, but logic  -  and history  -  tell us that there is always a tipping point.
0248.00020; The decline and fall of the Roman Empire is one obvious reminder. More to the point, we should remember that Detroit, the booming Silicon Valley of its time, arrogantly assumed that its prosperity was impregnable, and then stumbled into a socioeconomic abyss.
0249.00001; Owners of blighted or obsolete buildings in Traverse City could soon receive tax benefits for redeveloping them under a program up for consideration by city commissioners tonight (Monday).
0249.00002; Commissioners will consider a policy that would allow the Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act (OPRA) to operate in Traverse City. The state program has been in place since 2000 and offers a tax incentive to assist in the redevelopment of older buildings in which a facility is contaminated, blighted, or functionally obsolete, according to program documents. Eligible projects  -  which must result in a commercial or mixed-use building  -  could have their taxable values frozen for up to 12 years, providing owners a considerable savings on property taxes.
0249.00003; By freezing the taxable value, it provides an incentive for the developer to make significant improvements to a building without increasing the property taxes on the building, documents state.
0249.00004; While offered by the state to qualifying communities  -  including Traverse City  -  for nearly two decades, city officials until now have never adopted a process for local applications to be considered.
0249.00005; That changed recently when Catalyst Development  -  the company that purchased the Old City Hall building on Cass Street and is completing a total renovation of the building (pictured)  -  inquired about the OPRA program, according to Downtown Development Authority (DDA) CEO Jean Derenzy.
0249.00006; Without a process in place to apply for the program, the development group moved ahead without it  -  but their request prompted Derenzy to recommend city commissioners put a process in place to allow future requests to be considered.
0249.00007; Even though it's available at the state level, locally we should have a policy to let anyone interested in this to have a procedure in place to follow, says Derenzy.
0249.00008; The city's proposed policy spells out eligibility requirements for property owners  -  including having a commercial or commercial housing property that is blighted, obsolete, or a facility (ie environmentally contaminated), having a legal interest in or purchase agreement for the site, and not being delinquent in any taxes or financial obligations to the city. Only projects initiated after the policy's adoption can be considered, and applicants will have to pay a to-be-determined fee to the city when applying for the program.
0249.00009; Requests are subject to both local and state approval, and city commissioners will receive an annual report summarizing the number of projects approved, estimated amount of property taxes abated and paid, and projected job and investment data from OPRA sites.
0249.00010; Derenzy says the program is another tool in the economic toolbox to encourage development and job growth in Traverse City. Any kind of tools to help with job creation make sense, she says.
0249.00011; You need as many options as you can to (encourage) different opportunities. > Commissioners will consider approving a recommendation from the planning commission to add hospitality house as a type of building use in hospital districts.
0249.00012; Planning commissioners originally discussed allowing short-term vacation rentals in hospital districts to accommodate patients or visitors of patients who were looking to stay near their hospitals.
0249.00013; However, a much narrower definition of hospitality house is proposed to be added to the city's code of ordinances to prevent other types of short-term rentals from taking off in such districts.
0249.00014; Under the proposed language, a hospitality house is defined as a noncommercial use of a building where living quarters are let to transient patients or relatives or companions of transient patients exclusively while receiving medical care doctors nurses or other transient medical staff or medical students of a local hospital or medical facility located in a hospital district.
0249.00015; > Commissioners will consider setting an October 7 public hearing regarding a residential permit parking program for city neighborhoods. The program would allow residents in certain areas to obtain free permits to park beyond posted time limits on their streets.
0249.00016; Commissioners could vote immediately after the public hearing at the October 7 meeting to approve the program.
0249.00017; > The new owners of the former Holiday Inn West Bay Beach resort will seek to transfer over all of the property's liquor licenses from the previous management as part of a planned transformation of the site. Charles Mallory and George Cochran would become the new recipients of the property's resort class-b hotel liquor license (including a specially designated merchant license) and four additional bar permits that also include allowances for Sunday sales, food sales, two outdoor service areas, and dancing/entertainment.
0249.00018; Mallory and Cochran told The Ticker in January they plan to spend $10 million transforming the 179-room hotel into Delamar Traverse City, a four-star property that would become an icon and showpiece for the region.
0249.00019; > Finally, commissioners will consider making several appointments to city boards and committees Monday.
0249.00020; Scott Moorey is recommended to be appointed to a three-year term on the Parks and Recreation Commission, while Nelson Asper and Andrea Deibler are recommended to be appointed to three-year terms on the Brown Bridge Advisory Committee.
0249.00021; Commissioners will consider appointing one of their own members to serve on the commission's adult-use (recreational) marijuana ad hoc committee, which is working with City Attorney Lauren Trible-Laucht and City Attorney Benjamin Marentette on possible city regulations for recreational marijuana facilities.
0249.00022; Commissioner Michele Howard previously served on the ad hoc committee but is resigning from the commission effective September 23, creating a vacancy on the ad hoc.
0250.00001; Stock markets across the world may have experienced a turbulent and disappointing period over recent months, but their long-term return prospects continue to be relatively bright.
0250.00002; In fact, the track record of the stock market suggests that it could provide a more appealing risk/reward opportunity than other investment opportunities, such as gold and Bitcoin.
0250.00003; Furthermore, through buying dividend stocks and reinvesting the income received from your investments, you may be able to build a surprisingly large nest egg in order to retire early.
0250.00004; While investing in gold can prove to be a worthwhile move during periods of economic uncertainty, in the long run the growth potential offered by the stock market may mean it is a better idea.
0250.00005; Certainly, buying gold miners while they trade on low valuations can be a shrewd move. Just as with any stock, paying a fair price for a high-quality business is always highly appealing. However, buying a gold ETF or even physical gold may inhibit an investor's long-term return potential versus dividend stocks.
0250.00006; Gold's lack of income, as well as its reduced utility following price increases, could mean that its long-term returns fail to match those of a diverse range of stocks.
0250.00007; That's especially the case when compounding is factored in, with the stock market offering the potential to build a larger nest egg, as well as greater diversification, than buying into the gold price.
0250.00008; As well as its lack of income, Bitcoin also has an unclear long-term future. It could prove to be closely correlated to the prospects for the wider economy, since its price is dependent upon investor sentiment rather than facts and figures.
0250.00009; As such, if investors become increasingly risk averse due to the risks facing the world economy, Bitcoin's price may come under significant pressure.
0250.00010; Furthermore, with the virtual currency's role in the world economy being unclear, it appears to have significant risks.
0250.00011; For example, other virtual currencies could become more prominent than Bitcoin, while concerns among lawmakers surrounding its security may mean that its future progress in terms of becoming a mainstream payment method is rather restricted. This may lead to disappointing returns for holders of Bitcoin over the coming years when compared to dividend stocks. The risk/reward opportunity presented by dividend stocks appears to be compelling  -  especially when compared to other assets such as Bitcoin and gold.
0250.00012; Buying a range of dividend-paying stocks has historically provided not only a sustainable income for investors that grows over the long run, but also access to capital returns which have largely outpaced other mainstream assets.
0250.00013; Unlike gold and Bitcoin, it is possible to obtain a large amount of diversity in the stock market.
0250.00014; Investors can buy companies operating across the global economy in a variety of sectors, and with a range of market caps.
0250.00015; This helps to reduce overall risk, and offers a more resilient return profile.
0250.00016; As such, while gold and Bitcoin may have delivered rises in recent months, dividend stocks appear to offer the best means of building a nest egg so that you can retire early.

Sebi restrained three entities belonging to Thapar-led Avantha Group from diverting their money or disposing of their assets email this article Your Email: Send me a copy: Gautam Thapar ALSO READ The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Tuesday debarred Gautam Thapar, the ousted chairman of fraud-hit CG Power and Industrial Solutions, from accessing the capital market for a number of alleged irregularities, including diversion of money.
0254.00003; The market regulator also barred the chief financial officer (CFO) and two directors of the company for their involvement in dubious transactions.
0254.00004; Further, Sebi restrained three entities belonging to Thapar-led Avantha Group from diverting their money or disposing of their assets. It has also directed CG Power to take necessary steps to recover the amount due to it and take legal action to safeguard the interests of investors.
0254.00005; The Sebi order comes nearly a month after the CG Power board said the company had been hit by an accounting scandal and the liabilities of the group had been understated by over Rs 1,600 crore for 2017-18.
0254.00006; Sebi said Thapar-promoted and -related entities owed Rs 1,723.19 crore as receivables to the company, while connected parties owed another Rs 462.74 crore.
0254.00007; Funds diverted from CG Power were fraudulently transferred to its promoter company Avantha Holdings and entities related/connected with the company, Avantha International, Acton, Ballarpur International, Mirabelle and Solaris, without the knowledge of the company and without any approval from its board, the report said.
0254.00008; After CG Power's disclosure of significant accounting irregularities, Sebi met its officials and studied the preliminary investigation report submitted by the company.
0254.00009; Sebi's examination of the report showed several irregularities and fraudulent transactions being carried out by key officials of the company including Thapar.
0254.00010; The transactions were purportedly carried out by certain company personnel (both current and past) including certain non - executive directors, etc.
0254.00011; The aforesaid transactions are prima facie designed to divert/siphon off money from the listed company, which rightfully belongs to its shareholders.
0254.00012; Some of the outgoing fund transfers do not appear to be supported by any comprehensible underlying transactions raising doubts on the bona fides and leaving gaps between various transactions, wrote G Mahalingam, whole-time member, Sebi, in his order.
0254.00013; According to Sebi's examination of the preliminary investigation report, some of the dubious transactions conducted by CG Power include sale of properties at Nashik and Mumbai to Blue Garden Estate and overseas remittance to some Avantha Group entities.
0254.00014; Sebi said a more detailed forensic audit could bring out the complete picture and the extent of the misappropriation. The market regulator said action was warranted against Thapar and others before the forensic audit is complete to safeguard investors.
0254.00015; At this stage, it is necessary to adopt some urgent measures to safeguard the interests of shareholders of CG Power and protect the integrity of the securities market, by securing any further erosion of the fundamentals of the listed company.
0254.00016; Sebi has directed the BSE to appoint an independent auditor for conducting a detailed forensic audit of the books of accounts of CG Power from the 2015-16 onwards.
0254.00017; Even before the company made disclosures on the accounting fraud, shares of CG Power had hit a downward trend, triggering invocation of promoter pledged shares by lenders.
0254.00018; At the end of last year, the promoter shareholding in CG Power was 34 per cent, which has now come down to 0.01 per cent since the pledge by promoters (of their entire shareholding) has been invoked by the lenders due to non-payment of dues.
0254.00019; Some of the large non-promoter shareholders are now lenders including YES Bank, HDFC Mutual Fund and Aditya Birla MF. Shares of CG Power and Industrial Solutions on Tuesday climbed 5 per cent after private equity giant KKR India picked up nearly 10 per cent in the company.

0255.00001; Load Error  Describing the U.S. economic outlook as favorable, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the rate cut was designed to provide insurance against ongoing risks including weak global growth and resurgent trade tensions. If the economy does turn down, then a more extensive sequence of rate cuts could be appropriate, Powell said in a news conference after the Fed announced it had lowered its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 1.75% to 2.00%.
0255.00002; It was the second Fed rate cut this year.
0255.00003; But, Powell said, what we think we are facing here is a situation which can be addressed, which should be addressed, with moderate adjustments to the federal funds rate, noting that the U.S. labor market was strong and inflation was likely to return to the Fed's 2% annual goal.
0255.00004; We are going to be highly data-dependent ...
0255.00005; We are not on a pre-set course, we are going to be making decisions meeting by meeting, Powell said, adding that the Fed would stop cutting rates when we think we've done enough.
0255.00006; Trump blasted Powell, saying the central bank chief had No 'guts,' no sense, no vision!
0255.00007; A terrible communicator, Trump tweeted before Powell had even begun his news conference.
0255.00008; Underscoring divisions within the central bank, the quarter-point rate cut on Wednesday drew dissents from three of the 10 voting policymakers.
0255.00009; Kansas City Fed President Esther George and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren called for no rate cut, and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard wanted a bigger half-point rate cut.
0255.00010; Forecasts from all 17 policymakers released at the end of the meeting showed even broader disagreement, with seven expecting a third rate cut this year, five seeing the current rate cut as the last for 2019, and five who appeared to have been against even Wednesday's move.
0255.00011; TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS  The central bank also widened the gap between the interest it pays banks on excess reserves and the top of its policy rate range, a step taken to smooth out problems in money markets that prompted a market intervention by the New York Fed this week.
0255.00012; In a hint that the Fed may soon take bigger steps, Powell acknowledged that strains in funding markets had been bigger than expected, and he said the central bank may need to resume increases to the Fed's balance sheet earlier than previously thought.
0255.00013; U.S. stocks, lower ahead of the statement, extended their losses and the U.S. Treasury yield curve flattened. The 10-year Treasury note yield inched up to 1.79%.
0255.00014; The dollar gained ground against the euro and yen .
0255.00015; Another rate cut from the Fed to try to shield the U.S. economy from global headwinds, said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.
0255.00016; Today's move was more of a hawkish easing in that the Fed's median forecasts for rates suggested no more cuts this year, while some officials dissented.
0255.00017; Still, traders of interest rate futures were betting on one more quarter-point rate cut this year.
0255.00018; New projections showed Fed policymakers at the median expected rates to stay within the new range through 2020. There is a lot of uncertainty around rate-path views and the economic outlook, Powell said.
0255.00019; There was little change in policymakers' projections for the economy, with GDP growth seen at a slightly higher 2.2% this year and the unemployment rate to be 3.7% through 2020. Inflation is projected to be 1.5% for the year, below the Fed's 2% target, before rising to 1.9% next year. The Fed also cut rates in July, the first such move since 2008, as it responded to risks from Trump's trade war with China and other overseas developments.

Getty Images Hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers were stranded on Monday by the collapse of the world's oldest travel firm Thomas Cook , sparking the largest peacetime repatriation effort in British history.
0256.00005; The liquidation marks the end of a British company that started in 1841 running local rail excursions and grew to pioneer the family package holiday across Europe, America, Africa and the Middle East.
0256.00006; Running hotels, resorts and airlines for 19 million people a year, it currently has around 600,000 people abroad and will need the help of governments and insurance firms to bring them home from places as far afield as Cancun, Cuba and Cyprus. Thomas Cook's demise, announced in the early hours of Monday after failing to secure a deal with creditors or a government bailout, sparked alarm at hotels where some customers have been asked to pay their bills again by out-of-pocket resort owners.
0256.00007; I'm not going to pay for my holiday again, David Midson from England told Reuters, trying to find information at the front desk of a hotel in Roda, Corfu.
0256.00008; I wish I had brought a driving license, because I can't get a taxi (to the airport). As well as its 21,000 employees, the company's fall hit global booking websites, credit card companies, travel firms using its airlines and British high streets where its travel agents were forced to shut.
0256.00009; Turkey and Greece also warned their hoteliers would suffer.
0256.00010; Thomas Cook has been brought low by a $2.1 billion debt pile, built up by a series of ill-fated deals, that hobbled its response to nimble online rivals.
0256.00011; It had to sell three million holidays a year just to cover interest payments.
0256.00012; As it struggled to pitch itself to a new generation of tourists, the company was hit by the 2016 coup attempt in Turkey, one of its top destinations, and the 2018 Europe-wide heatwave which deterred customers from going abroad.
0256.00013; It had agreed a 900 million pound rescue package with its banks and largest shareholder, China's Fosun, but lenders asked for an additional 200 million pounds to keep it operating through the winter.
0256.00014; In desperate meetings held over the weekend, it failed to secure more funds, with the British government also refusing a bailout, judging it was not a good long-term bet.
0256.00015; VIDEO3:3203:32 UK regulator on Thomas Cook collapse: 'Nobody will be stranded' Emergency flights Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to get stranded British travelers home, increasing pressure on the government just as it tries to negotiate an incredibly complicated withdrawal from the European Union.
0256.00016; It is a very difficult situation and obviously our thoughts are very much with the customers of Thomas Cook, Johnson told reporters on a plane as he headed to the U.N.
0256.00017; We will do our level best to get them home.
0256.00018; The UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said it had a fleet of planes ready to bring home the more than 150,000 British customers over the next two weeks.
0256.00019; Thomas Cook's German airline subsidiary, Condor, said there were 240,000 people booked on its flights awaiting a return home.
0256.00020; Its flights are still operating for now, and it has asked the German government for a bridging loan.
0256.00021; In Germany, insurance companies coordinate any repatriation.
0256.00022; There are around 50,000 holidaymakers affected in Greece, and around 35,000 from Nordic countries using Thomas Cook. I would like to apologize to our millions of customers, and thousands of employees, suppliers and partners who have supported us for many years, Thomas Cook Chief Executive Peter Fankhauser said in a statement.
0256.00023; At Manchester Airport in northwest England, all Thomas Cook branding was removed from check-in desks.
0256.00024; Pictures posted on social media showed staff walking away from their final flights.
0256.00025; Love my job so much, don't want it to end, Kia Dawn Hayward, a member of the company's cabin crew, said on Twitter.
0256.00026; The collapse could provide a boost, however, to major rival TUI , whose shares surged more than 10% on Monday, and to Europe's overcrowded airline sector, which could benefit from the closure of Thomas Cook's airline business.
0256.00027; VIDEO2:4402:44 Starting to see some cracks in the UK consumer: Strategist Corporate collapse Founded by a Baptist preacher who wanted to steer workers away from sin, Thomas Cook went on to forge the foundations of modern mass tourism.
0256.00028; On Monday, though, its own 178 year journey came to an end.UK customers were told not to travel to airports until they had been informed via a special website that they were booked on a return chartered flight.
0256.00029; The website showed some flights were returning to different British airports, but many were only running a few hours behind the original Thomas Cook scheduled flight and the system appeared to be working well. The British regulator is also contacting hotels hosting Thomas Cook customers to tell them they will be paid by the government, through an insurance scheme. That was after some customers were briefly held in a hotel in Tunisia when staff asked for additional payments to be made.
0256.00030; In the longer term, the collapse could hit the tourism sectors in the company's biggest destinations, such as Spain, Greece, Turkey and the Canary Islands, where some hotels work exclusively with Thomas Cook. Bondholders, banks and shareholders also lost out, while aircraft leasing companies were reclaiming their planes. This is an earthquake on a scale of seven, now we are waiting for the tsunami, Michalis Vlatakis, president of the Association of Travel Agents of Crete, told the Athens News Agency.

0257.00001; Finance Committee Sends Bills on Taxes, Insurance to Rules By  Susan Ellis  -  Share  Facebook  Twitter  Pinterest  Email  From left, Gary Halyard, Nesha Christian-Hendrickson, Gary Molloy, commissioner, and Elston George provide testimony to the senate about Department of Labor matters.
0257.00002; The approved bills will be forwarded to the Rules and Judiciary which can, if it chooses, pass the bills on to the full Legislature for approval.
0257.00003; The requested amount would be half of the federal excise tax of 18.3 cents a galleon. Director of Management and Budget Jenifer O'Neal told the lawmakers the refinery is expected to produce between 45,000 and 53,000 barrels a day ( A barrel is 45 galleons.)
0257.00004; She estimated the federal excise tax revenue between $370,575 and $436,455 a day and if the V.I. government received 50 percent of the excise receipts, it would amount to $67 million to $79 million per year, based on an average of 53,000 barrels per day.
0257.00005; It should be noted that any additional revenues received by GVI (Government of the Virgin Islands) would help alleviate a difficult financial situation.
0257.00006; The estimated structural deficit of GVI is estimated to be between $85 million and $115 million per year, she testified.
0257.00007; Donald G. Cole also testified in favor of the legislation.
0257.00008; He was part of a delegation from the 24th Legislature that petitioned the U.S. Congress to amend the Organic Act to authorize a refund to the U.S. Virgin Islands.
0257.00009; The USVI legislation was included in a large funding bill related to the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, drafted by the U.S. House of Representatives but not supported in the U.S. Senate.
0257.00010; Bill Simmons, director of Dutko Government Relations, a private firm that worked with the territory in the 2000 appeal, said the timing in Washington D.C. is ideal to try again. Dwayne DeGraff said I vote yes already, and the rest of the committee approved the measure, adding they need more action in the request to Congress. Labor Department to implement a new method to assign unemployment insurance taxes to employers.
0257.00011; According to commissioner of Labor Gary Molloy the change is necessary to bring the territory into compliance with federal law, will be easier to administer and will ensure the future solvency of the Virgin Islands Trust Fund.
0257.00012; Malloy testified that as of Sept. 11, the Virgin Islands outstanding trust fund loan balance was $63.4 million. There is $4.4 million in the our current trust fund to cover current benefits, he said. The recession in 2007 and the loss of Hovensa LLC in 2012 depleted the trust fund, which had been $66 million in 2001.
0257.00013; The 24th Legislature than decided to lower the rate paid for unemployment insurance to zero for current employers and 1.5 percent for new employers.
0257.00014; If not for this change, the VIUTF most likely would have remained solvent.
0257.00015; This continued imbalance eventually led to the total insolvency of the Virgin Islands Unemployment Trust Fund, Molloy said. Although the governor vetoed the bill, the Senate overrode it according to Vialet and not changes were made until 2012 when the rates were raised to one percent and one and a half percent.
0257.00016; Then, Molloy raised the rate to a flat 2.5 percent.
0257.00017; The proposed legislation will base the employers' tax rate on their payroll and contributions into the system  -  the highs and lows of the company's payroll  -  instead of a flat tax rate. Employers being charged for employees who left the business but were not laid off will not be charged.
0257.00018; The U.S. Virgin Islands has until Oct. 31 to come into compliance and eliminate the flat tax rate, according to Molloy.
0257.00019; DeGraff said they didn't have much choice but to approve the bill. Oakland Benta wanted to know if the new rate would hurt small businesses and Molloy said all businesses would be motivated to increase their payroll and that small businesses now carried the brunt.
0257.00020; The bill was approved unanimously.
0257.00021; The last four bills involved changes in the Virgin Islands Code to allow the Division of Banking, Insurance and Financial Regulation to undergo and pass a certification inspection by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
0257.00022; Senators commended testifiers, Gwendolyn Brady, Division director and Glendina Matthew, assistant director and legal counsel, on a thorough presentation.
0257.00023; Gwendolyn Brady, director, said they are high risk, cash-infused businesses subject to violation of bank secrecy and anti-money laundering laws and need more monitoring.
0257.00024; Code and adds a section to provide protection for policyholders holding health and life insurance in the territory if a company becomes insolvent.
0257.00025; This is required for NAIC confirmation, according to Brady.
0257.00026; A third-party administrator is a person who underwrites, collects charges, collateral or premiums or adjusts or settles claims in connection with life, annuity, health or stop-loss coverage.
0257.00027; All reports are to be kept confidential, according to the bill. Speaking on behalf of the legislation, Henry Feuerzeig of Dudley, Newman, Feuerzeig LLP, also the general representative of Underwriters at Lloyds, said the bill will help the Division reach NAIC accreditation and put the territory on par with other U.S. jurisdictions with greater protection for policyholders.

0258.00001; (ANI Image)  The Election Commission on Wednesday ruled out the use of ballot papers in next month's Maharashtra Assembly elections, terming them history and defended EVMs, saying these machines cannot be tampered with. Addressing reporters after reviewing poll preparedness in the state, Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora also said the Assembly poll expenditure limit of candidates cannot be changed for now.
0258.00002; His comments come in the wake of parties like the Shiv Sena and the NCP demanding that ceiling be raised from the present Rs 28 lakh per candidate.
0258.00003; More central armed forces would be deployed in Left wing extremism-affected areas of the state, he said.
0258.00004; The Congress and NCP were among the key opposition parties which raised alarm about the use of the electronic voting machines (EVMs) in elections.
0258.00005; Parties keep raising the issue (of EVMs).
0258.00006; We have told them politely and firmly that ballot paper is history now.
0258.00007; And I can tell all of you, all of us can tell you looking into your eyes, that EVM cannot be, I repeat, cannot be tampered with, Arora said. It can malfunction like any other machine, like your watch, vehicle can malfunction.
0258.00008; But it cannot be tampered with, it is a standalone machine, different from other machines, he said. Even the Supreme Court, in its rulings on the issues relating to EVMs, has kind of upheld this, Arora said. The issue about discrepancy in actual votes polled and counted during the Lok Sabha election did not figure in the Commission's meetings with the political parties on Wednesday.
0258.00009; On some parties seeking specific election dates keeping in mind Diwali festival, Arora said the Commission considers various factors before preparing the poll schedule.
0258.00010; All the parties talked about Diwali next month and cited different dates (for holding elections), he said.
0258.00011; But in any case, while deciding the dates, the commission does try to take care of various factors like holidays and schools, examinations of kids, very important festivals of different religions, he said.
0258.00012; The election dates and number of phases it will be conducted in will be duly informed at a Press briefing in Delhi, he said.
0258.00013; Arora also said efforts will be made to increase voting percentage in the ensuing Assembly polls.
0258.00014; Movement of central forces from one place to another is a significant factor in deciding polling dates, Arora said.
0258.00015; Arora said Maharashtra's chief secretary asked him if the state administration can continue doing relief work in some Western Maharashtra districts like Sangli and Kolhapur.
0258.00016; We told them there are provisions on this in the MCC (model code of conduct) and if they (the state administration) will make a need-based case, the Commission will consider sympathetically, he said.
0258.00017; He said the Commission attaches maximum importance to ensuring conducive environment for free and fair elections whether it is Lok Sabha or the Assembly.
0258.00018; Voters' slip distribution should be started early enough, he said, adding Maharashtra's Chief Electoral Officer has assured that more care will be taken on this count.
0258.00019; The Commission has also sought effective utilisation of information technology applications such as CVigil, a tool of citizen empowerment, he said.
0258.00020; The parties feel polling stations should be located on ground floor to facilitate senior citizens and differently abled persons, he said.
0258.00021; The state administration has already shifted many polling stations to ground floor, he said. Arora said during their visit to Maharashtra, the election commissioners on Wednesday interacted with political parties, district administration and central regulatory agencies, chief secretary, DGP and other senior officials to review preparations for the Assembly elections.

0260.00002; Shares in the group shed as much as 10 per cent of their value today as Investec said that the cost of shutting or running down several business lines would cut about £42 million off pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of September.
0260.00003; The bank also said that, while parts of the group were performing well, a decline in fees from advising on merger deals and raising capital, as well as securities trading in the UK had acted as a drag on earnings.

0264.00002; The acquisition makes Kryton Sensohive's largest shareholder.
0264.00003; Kryton will also be the exclusive North American distributor of Sensohive's award-winning Maturix™ technology, which uses advanced sensors and software enabling contractors and engineers to wirelessly monitor the concrete hardening process in real time from virtually any internet-connected device. Sensohive's Maturix™ technology represents a significant leap forward in construction efficiency and productivity, said Kryton's President and CEO, Kari Yuers.

0264.00005; This acquisition is consistent with Kryton's goal of helping contractors build faster and smarter through innovation.
0264.00006; It's also an important addition to our Smart Concrete® brand, she added.
0264.00007; We are very excited to be partnering with a global brand like Kryton, said Sensohive Technologies CEO Casper Harlev.
0264.00008; Kryton has a long history of success and a well-earned reputation for quality and trust in the global construction industry.
0264.00009; We value their substantial experience in bringing innovative and valuable technologies to the concrete construction market. Real-time monitoring of structures is an evolving field in the construction industry made possible through the rapidly expanding Internet of Things (IoT)  -  the interconnected digital network allowing everyday objects to be embedded with electronics collecting and sharing data.
0264.00010; Maturix™ technology runs on the Sigfox 0G network, the world's largest IoT network covering 1 billion people in 65 countries.
0264.00011; Sigfox's long-range and low-power demand network allows Sensohive's sensor batteries to last for up to 10 years.
0264.00012; No other concrete sensor can claim such a long life, reliability, reusability and be completely wireless.
0264.00013; It is through the association of major players such as Kryton, Sensohive and Sigfox, each an expert and disruptor in their field, that the real digital transformation will take place in the construction sector, added Raouti Chehih, Chief Adoption Officer at Sigfox. We are extremely proud to see the winner of our Best Global Star award 2018 grow so quickly in the market.
0264.00014; Conventional single-use concrete sensors on the market today collect data through Bluetooth NFC transmitted to a phone or device or through a wireless gateway. This typically requires a person to visit the jobsite and be near the sensor to take the Bluetooth reading and send updates.
0264.00015; Maturix™ uses thermocouples and reusable temperature sensors providing real-time connectivity and remote monitoring of concrete maturity and strength. Data is automatically collected every ten minutes and transmitted wirelessly to the cloud with information available in various report formats.
0264.00016; Sensohive's wireless sensors have been used in numerous European construction projects including major projects built by PASCHAL GmbH, VolkerWessels, Heidelberg Cement, NCC, Skanska and Kruse Smith, among others.
0264.00017; PASCHAL has been in the construction business for more than 50 years, and we have a strong focus to support and enable the digital transformation in our industry.
0264.00018; We believe Maturix ™ is the right way to digitalize and improve all processes around curing concrete. We have already seen significant changes and improvements with our customers and believe there is a lot more to gain in the future, says Michael Stoevelbaek, CEO at PASCHAL-Werk G. Maier GmbH, located in Steinach, Germany. With the advent of smart buildings and smart cities, planners, designers and engineers are now taking an evidence-based approach to urban design and construction, which this type of technology can provide.
0264.00019; Smart buildings are not going to be built without smart sensors, points out Yuers.
0264.00020; And any major structure or project being built today starts with concrete.

0265.00001; 198 Main Street  Suite 100  Trussville, AL 35173  (205) 661-9333 MENU  Tip: Dividend Dates. There are four important dates for dividends: Declaration Date: The company announces when it will pay a dividend and how much the dividend will be worth.
0265.00002; Ex-Dividend Date: Shareholders of record before this date are entitled to receive the next dividend payment. Record Date: On this date, the list of stockholders is finalized.
0265.00003; Payable Date: On this date, the taxable dividend is paid to shareholders.
0265.00004; When interest rates reach historic lows, some investors in search of income-generating investments turn to dividend-yielding stocks.
0265.00005; Dividends are taxable payments made by a company to its shareholders.
0265.00006; When a company makes a profit, that money can be put to two uses - it can be reinvested in the business or it can be paid out to the company's shareholders in the form of a dividend.
0265.00007; Some dividends are paid quarterly and others are paid monthly.
0265.00008; Investors track dividend-yielding stocks by examining a pair of ratios.
0265.00009; Dividend per share measures how much cash an investor is scheduled to receive for each share of dividend-yielding stock. It is calculated by adding up the total dividends paid out over a year (not including special dividends) and dividing by the number of shares of stock that are outstanding. Dividend yield measures how much cash an investor is scheduled to receive for each dollar invested in a dividend-yielding stock.
0265.00010; It is calculated by dividing the dividends per share by the share price. Investing in dividend-paying stocks can create a stream of taxable income. But the fact that a company is paying dividends is only one factor to consider when choosing a stock investment.
0265.00011; Dividends can be stopped, increased, or decreased at any time.
0265.00012; Unlike interest from a corporate bond, which is normally a set amount determined and approved by a company's board of directors.
0265.00013; If a company is experiencing financial difficulties, its board may reduce or eliminate its dividend for a period of time.
0265.00014; If a company is outperforming expectations, it may boost its dividend or pay shareholders a special one-time payout.
0265.00015; When considering a dividend-yielding stock, focus first on the company's cash position. Companies with a strong cash position may be able to pay their scheduled dividend without interruption.
0265.00016; Many mature, profitable companies are in a position to offer regular dividends to shareholders as a way to attract investors to the stock. Dividend income is currently taxed at a maximum rate of 20%. Be cautious when considering investments that pay a high dividend.
0265.00017; While past history cannot predict future performance, companies with established histories of consistent dividend payment may be more likely to continue that performance in the future.
0265.00018; In a period of low interest rates, investors who want income may want to consider all their options.
0265.00019; Dividend-yielding stocks can generate taxable income but, like most investments, they should be carefully reviewed before you commit any dollars.
0265.00020; Keep in mind that the return and principal value of stock prices will fluctuate as market conditions change.
0265.00021; And shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

0268.00038; Compensation of employees is income for the contribution of labor inputs to the production process.
0268.00039; Secondary income consists of current transfers between residents and nonresidents.
0268.00040; Unlike an exchange, a transfer is a transaction in which a good, service, or asset is provided without a corresponding return of economic value.
0268.00041; Secondary income receipts and payments include U.S. government and private transfers, such as U.S. government grants and pensions, fines and penalties, withholding taxes, personal transfers (remittances), insurance-related transfers, and other current transfers.
0268.00042; The capital account consists of capital transfers between residents and nonresidents and the cross-border acquisition and disposal of nonproduced nonfinancial assets.
0268.00043; Capital transfers include debt forgiveness and certain disaster-related nonlife insurance claims. Nonproduced nonfinancial assets include natural resources and contracts, leases, and licenses.
0268.00044; Capital account transactions are distinguished from current account transactions in that capital account transactions result in a change in the assets of one or both parties to the transaction without affecting the income or savings of either party. The financial account consists of transactions between U.S. residents and nonresidents for direct investment, portfolio investment, other investment, reserves, and financial derivatives other than reserves. Direct investment is a category of cross-border investment associated with a resident in one economy having control or a significant degree of influence over the management of an enterprise resident in another economy.
0268.00045; Ownership or control of 10 percent or more of the voting securities of an entity is the threshold for separating direct investment from other types of investment. Direct investment transactions include transactions in equity (including reinvestment of earnings) and debt instruments. Portfolio investment transactions consist of cross-border transactions involving equity and investment fund shares and debt securities, excluding those included in direct investment or reserve assets.
0268.00046; Other investment is a residual category that includes cross-border financial instruments other than those included in direct investment, portfolio investment, financial derivatives, and reserve assets.
0268.00047; Other investment transactions consist of transactions in currency and deposits, loans, insurance technical reserves, trade credit and advances, and, for liabilities, special drawing rights allocations. Reserve assets are those external assets that are readily available to and controlled by monetary authorities for meeting balance of payments financing needs, for intervention in exchange markets to affect the currency exchange rate, and for other related purposes such as maintaining confidence in the currency and the economy and serving as a basis for foreign borrowing.
0268.00048; The major published components are monetary gold, International Monetary Fund (IMF) special drawing rights (SDRs), reserve position in the IMF, and other reserve assets.
0268.00049; Financial derivatives other than reserves consist of financial contracts that are linked to underlying financial instruments, commodities, or indicators. Transactions in financial derivatives consist of U.S. cash receipts and payments arising from the sale, purchase, periodic settlement, or final settlement of financial derivatives contracts.
0268.00050; Transactions in financial derivatives are only available as a net value equal to transactions for assets less transactions for liabilities. A positive value represents net cash payments by U.S. residents to foreign residents from settlements of derivatives contracts (net lending) and a negative value represents net U.S. cash receipts (net borrowing). The statistical discrepancy is the difference between net acquisition of assets and net incurrence of liabilities in the financial account (including financial derivatives) less the difference between total credits and total debits recorded in the current and capital accounts.
0268.00051; The statistical discrepancy can also be calculated as the difference between net lending (borrowing) measured from financial account transactions and net lending (borrowing) measured from current and capital account transactions.
0268.00052; The current account balance is the difference between credits (exports and income receipts) and debits (imports and income payments) in the current account.
0268.00053; The balance is a net measure of current account transactions between the United States and the rest of the world.
0268.00054; A positive balance indicates a current account surplus.
0268.00055; A negative balance indicates a current account deficit. Net lending (borrowing) measures the balance of funds supplied to the rest of the world.
0268.00056; Net lending means that, in net terms, the U.S. economy supplies funds to the rest of the world. Net borrowing means the opposite.
0268.00057; Net lending (borrowing) can be measured by current and capital account transactions or by financial account transactions.
0268.00058; Conceptually, the two measures are equal. In practice, the two measures differ by the statistical discrepancy.

0272.00001; A granddaughter of one time Cabinet minister the late Njenga Karume, who died on Saturday in United States, had begged for funds to cater for her medical bills, emails seen by the Daily Nation show.
0272.00002; Michelle Wariara Karume, 25, who died in Houston, Texas after a long battle with cancer, had on March 21, 2019 penned an emotional appeal for funds to the trustees of the multibillion estate of the late Karume. She was the daughter of the late Joseph Karume Njenga, a son of the former Kiambu politician, and had been ailing since 2014. TOO LATE   According to family sources, the funds were provided in May this year, too late in the day to turn the tide of cancer that was ravaging her.
0272.00003; The email was sent to George Waireri, one of the trustees of Mr Karume's estate and copied to her relatives.
0272.00004; But Mr Waireri Thursday said the death had nothing to do with lack of funds.
0272.00005; She was there for over a year being treated.
0272.00006; It has nothing to do with availability of funds, at all. The death came as a result of cancer.
0272.00007; She was assisted but could not survive the cancer, he said.
0272.00008; NO ACCESS TO FUNDS   This was disputed by Peter Munge, lawyer for Mr Karume's children, who said Ms Wariara died because she could not access treatment due to lack of funds.

0272.00010; My final wishes, I would like you all to take a minute to reflect on my current situation, because it has taken courage, compassion and faith in God to overcome and get through every day.
0272.00011; It is with a heavy heart that it has come to this, but I am running out of time here.
0272.00012; I kindly would like to know the way forward because it is such a terribly long time since I was on treatment, wrote Ms Karume on email.
0272.00013; What is the purpose of my grandfather's wealth if it alone cannot benefit someone as myself when it comes to my healthcare purposes?
0272.00014; MISSED MEDICATION   She explained in detail how she had missed her medication simply because funds were not forthcoming.

0272.00016; At first I was anxiously hesitant to accept it because I was required to pay a huge amount out of pocket to proceed with the treatment and then I was told to wait that money has being allocated and not fly back to Kenya.
0272.00017; I was enrolled into the trial in January....then February....then March....still waiting on funds.

0273.00001; Flourishing businesses of Mykola Zlochevskyi  -  Investigation 01.03.2017  Among those who became hugely wealthy during Yanukovych presidency is Mykola Zlochevskyi.
0273.00002; As Minister of Ecology he grew his business, the Burisma Group, into one of the biggest private gas producing companies in the country.
0273.00003; Licenses for gas deposit exploitation benefitting Zlochevskyi's companies were approved by his Ministry.
0273.00004; He fled the country after Maidan, but in three years since, his business is still running smoothly.
0273.00005; Zlochevskyi is no longer wanted, criminal proceedings against him have been closed by the prosecutor's office one by one.
0273.00006; Such decisions are not usually taken without consent from the country leaders.
0273.00007; Maybe the president's inner circle is interested in the stability of Zlochevskyi's business in the exploration of and selling of gas in Ukraine, the legitimacy of which is questionable?
0273.00008; Journalists of Schemes TV-progamme, the joint project of Radio Svoboda and UA:Pershyi channel have got access to the reports of Burisma Group for 2016 and analyzed who buys gas from Zlochevskyi's companies.
0273.00009; Abandoned fortress  Back in 2009, there was only bare forest was between Vyshorod and the village of Khotianivka near Kyiv.
0273.00010; In one year, on the site of felled trees, a huge construction project began on Kyiv Reservoir.
0273.00011; Mansion which was built by former Minister of Ecology Mykola Zlochevskyi on the dam of Kyiv Reservoir  As Minister of Ecology in the Azarov Government, Mykola Zlochevskyi started building his future fortresses there.
0273.00012; He moved here about a year before Maidan.
0273.00013; One of the mansions built by Mykola Zlochevskyi near Kyiv dam reservoir. How did Mykola Zlochevskyi enrich himself?
0273.00014; On the one hand, Zlochevskyi was the Head of the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources.
0273.00015; This position endowed him with the responsibility for granting access to, and permitting the extraction of Ukrainian sub-soil resources. On the other hand, Zlochevskyi was the owner of a business which received gas extraction licenses at several sites across Ukraine.
0273.00016; These licenses were issued with numerous legal violations, including the lack of auction or competition.
0273.00017; Thus, once in an influential position, Zlochevskyi built his own super-profitable business into one of the biggest gas extraction private companies in Ukraine  - the Burisma Group.
0273.00018; He even invited former-president of Poland Oleksandr Kvasnevkyi and the son of former US vice-president Hunter Biden onto the Board of Directors.
0273.00019; There is very clear evidence that companies associated with Zlochevskyi did not file one important document  -  that stating the approval of local community. Is this a violation? Yes, this is total violation.
0273.00020; states Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, the Head of Transparency International Ukraine.
0273.00021; Yurchyshyn believes that a court appeal, to cease the activities of such companies, based on the lack of this document would be possible.
0273.00022; What was Zlochevskyi's fate after Maidan?
0273.00023; After the Revolution of Dignity Zlochevskyi fled Ukraine.
0273.00024; His fortress on the Kyiv dam is still empty.
0273.00025; Law enforcement agencies started several criminal investigations against the former minister and his companies.
0273.00026; Yet, almost three years of investigation have come to nothing. Zlochevskyi's business is still running like clockwork.
0273.00027; Today, the Burisma Group's companies continue to extracting Ukrainian gas in 5 regions at 8 sites, while Zlochevskyi is navigating his issues with law enforcement both in Ukraine and abroad.
0273.00028; A London court lifted the freezing of $23,5 millon in Zlochevskyi's accounts by the UK Serious Fraud Office because the Ukrainian Prosecutor's office had not provided evidence that these funds had come from illicit sources.
0273.00029; The proceedings, begun in the UK were not investigated in a normal, professional and independent way by Ukrainian Prosecutor's office.
0273.00030; The investigation was dropped, possibly with the involvement of a political negotiations, states Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of Anti-Corruption Action Centre. The Ministry of Internal Affairs removed Zlochevskyi from its wanted list. The General Prosecutor's Office initially investigated Zlochevskyi's alleged illicit enrichment, but shifted its investigation to that of a more minor offense, tax evasion, and eventually closed the case in 2016.
0273.00031; Recently, the Burisma Group cheerfully declared that all proceedings against Mykola Zlochevskyi and his companies in Ukraine had been closed, thanks to the payment of 180 million UAH additionally charged taxes.
0273.00032; The decision to fully close all pending legal proceedings and criminal allegations was the result of many months of full cooperation between the Office of the General Prosecutor and the legal team representing the Burisma Group, the company stated.
0273.00033; Experts at Transparency International and the Anti-Corruption Action Centre who were monitoring the investigation from the beginning, believe that the General Prosecutor's Office's closing of criminal cases against Mykola Zlochevskyi and his company was the result of political negotiations.
0273.00034; It is obvious that the Prosecutor's office dropped the case against Zlochevskyi.
0273.00035; It is obvious that Prosecutor's office dropped the case against Burisma.
0273.00036; It is obvious that Prosecutor's office did not investigate in full how Zlochevskyi issued licenses for himself, says Daria Kaleniuk.
0273.00037; It could be political stich-up, Yaroslav Yurchyshyn agrees.
0273.00038; Zlochevskyi and his companies are, however, still the subject of interest for two other Ukrainian agencies, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the newly-created Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office.
0273.00039; The latter of which is trying to cancel the Burisma Group's gas extraction licenses through the courts.
0273.00040; This however, has not been with success.
0273.00041; Lobbing at the highest level?
0273.00042; Who exactly in the post-Maidan government permitted the whitewashing of this former official from the Yanukovytch era, who built himself a corrupt fortune in power?
0273.00043; Two men who look like Ihor kononenko and Mykola Zlochevskyi are meeting in Vienna.
0273.00044; Photo from Facebook of Olha Vasylevska.
0273.00045; These photos were recently published by Ukraininan journalist Olha Vasylevska.
0273.00046; What could possibly have been discussed by president Petro Poroshenko's closest associate, and a defendant in several criminal cases, also a previously close associate of Viktor Yanukovych?
0273.00047; It is no secret that Zlochevskyi's cases in Ukraine were investigated by the investigative department dealing with severe economic crimes in the Prosecutor General's Office, which is informally dubbed the Department of Kononenko-Granovskyi, referring to two MPs from the Petro Poroshenko Block.
0273.00048; Ihor Kononenko and Vadim Granovskyi's influence on the Prosecutor General's Office, which is headed by Yuriy Lutsenko has been detailed in numerous media investigations.
0273.00049; Inevitably, the publication of these photos has only increased suspicions that the closing of cases against Zlochevskyi, incorporated some sort of political agreement. Yet, what is the benefit for the government and the president's inner circle?
0273.00050; MP Ihor Kononenko and Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko  Those with stakes in the gas market suggest that Mykola Zlochevskyi could give up part of his business in exchange for immunity from prosecution.
0273.00051; However, analysis of his companies' ownership structure does not lend credence to these rumors.
0273.00052; Zlochevskyi remains the sole benefactor of the Burisma Group, as far as public official documents suggest.
0273.00053; So, why is the extraction and selling of extracting and selling of gas by Zlochevskyi's companies is beneficial for president's inner circle?
0273.00054; Maybe they are buying it for the needs of their own business? Schemes got access to the reports of the Burisma Group's companies for 2016 and analyzed who buys gas from Zlochevskyi's companies. Their suspicions were confirmed.

0273.00060; Some was sold to the companies of the Burisma Group for further resale.
0273.00061; The rest of the gas was delivered directly to real VIP-clients, companies of the President Petro Poroshenko, MP Igor Kononenko and Deputy Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleg Gladkovskyi.
0273.00062; Companies of Petro Poroshenko, Ihor Kononenko and Oleg Gladkovskyi paid more than 101 million UAH for gas to Mykola Zlochevskyi's company in 2016.

0273.00069; In 2016, the fitness club bought gas for more than 2,5 million UAH. Thus, three companies of the President of Ukraine and his business partners paid to Mykola Zlochevskyi's company more than 100 million UAH in 2016 alone.
0273.00070; Corruption consensus or just business?
0273.00071; At least several dozen companies, which are extracting and selling gas on such a large scale exist in Ukraine.
0273.00072; But firms of top officials are buying it from the Burisma Group, owned by Mykola Zlochevskyi, former Minister in the Azarov's Government, who fled Ukraine under the threat of criminal investigation.
0273.00073; Ukrainian prosecutors did not manage to cancel his gas licenses, issued with numerous violations.
0273.00074; What is this  -  just business? Or a consensus in favor of corruption under mutually agreed conditions?

0273.00080; But they also did not refute the fact that they bought gas from Zlochevskyi's company in 2016.
0273.00081; The reply for question on the duration and conditions of cooperation with Zlochevskyi's companies of Piskivsk Glassware Factory was the following: In order to reach highest financial results company has the right to choose the best offer among number of supliers, using many criteria including price… The disclose of commercial secret is unfeasible for the company in order to maintain effective high level competition on glass containers market.

0278.00001; 847-852-1420  The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act represents the most sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code in more than 30 years.1  For millions of Americans and businesses it means an altered financial and investment landscape with new opportunities and challenges in the years ahead. Keep in mind, however, that the information in this material is not intended as tax advice, and may not be used for the purpose of avoiding any federal tax penalties.
0278.00002; Businesses may begin benefiting from a number of changes, including  Reduction in the top tax bracket from 35 percent to 21 percent Full and immediate expensing of capital investments (phased out after five years) Implementation of a territorial tax system that taxes only income earned within the U.S. Special one-time tax on repatriation of foreign earnings Repeal of corporate Alternative Minimum Tax and A 20 percent deduction of qualified business income from certain pass-through entities.
0278.00003; Service industries (e.g., health, law, professional services) are generally excluded, except where income is below $315,000 for joint filers and $157,500 for other filers.
0278.00004; Business owners should consider meeting with a tax professional to understand the impact of these changes on employee benefits, business investment, and corporate structure. Keep in mind the information in this material is not intended as tax advice, and may not be used for the purpose of avoiding any federal tax penalties. The changes in tax law may affect companies differently, which could shift where future investment opportunities may be found.
0278.00005; For instance, the lower tax rate may be more meaningful to higher-taxed industries, which can include certain retail, healthcare and telecom firms.
0278.00006; Real estate investment trust companies also may benefit from the new pass-through deductions and exclusion from the new limit on interest deductibility of 30 percent of net income.
0278.00007; Conversely, with the changes made to individual taxation (see below), there may be a negative impact on home builders and realtors, while highly leveraged businesses potentially may burdened by the new cap on interest deductibility.
0278.00008; Past performance does not guarantee future results.
0278.00009; The return and principal value of stock prices will fluctuate as market conditions change.
0278.00010; And shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
0278.00011; The Tax Policy Center projects that taxes will fall for all income groups and result in an increase of 2.2 percent in after-tax income.
0278.00012; 7  These tax changes may have wide ranging impact on the financial choices you make. For example, you may want to consider the best use for your additional after-tax income.
0278.00013; Keep in mind the information in this material is not intended as tax advice, and may not be used for the purpose of avoiding any federal tax penalties.
0278.00014; The estate tax exemption was raised to $11.2 million, a doubling of the $5.6 million that previously existed.
0278.00015; As such, individuals benefiting from this change may want to re-evaluate the strategies they have in place to address the tax and liquidity issues that may no longer exist.
0278.00016; The nature and shape of the nation's tax system inevitably influences the everyday decisions made by individuals and businesses alike.

0279.00001; Dennis Uy debuts on the list with an estimated net worth of $660 million  Courtesy of Udenna Group  This story is part of Forbes' coverage of Philippines' Richest 2019. See the full list here.
0279.00002; Dennis Uy is a man in a hurry.
0279.00003; Through his Udenna group he has, in just a few years, bought stakes in more than 50 companies. Only 46, he now joins the ranks of the country's 50 richest, with an estimated net worth of $660 million.
0279.00004; Uy's ascent began in 2002, when he founded Phoenix Petroleum, growing it into the Philippines' largest independent fuel retailer. We disrupted petroleum.
0279.00005; And maybe now telco, he says, referring to Udenna's joint telecom venture with China Telecom, Dito Telecommunity. In July, Dito Telecommunity won a license to offer nationwide cellular service and crack the existing duopoly of PLDT and Globe Telecom. Some worry about Udenna's debt load of roughly 111 billion pesos ($2 billion), which Uy used to fuel his buying binge.
0279.00006; The group's total debt climbed 38% last year, more than double shareholder equity.
0279.00007; Yet Uy is unfazed.
0279.00008; Part of our challenges of being entrepreneurs, especially from the province and with no name, is how to borrow money, he says.
0279.00009; Udenna posted a profit of 2.6 billion pesos last year as sales jumped 86% to 95 billion pesos.
0279.00010; More on Forbes: Philippines' Richest 2019: William Belo Capitalizes On Construction Boom  Next up for Uy is a possible backdoor listing of Udenna. In January, Udenna reached a share-swap agreement with listed telecommunications holding company ISM Communications, in which Uy bought a controlling stake last year. Uy is now waiting for regulatory approval to complete the deal.
0279.00011; If I were a son of a taipan, growing into this business, nobody would question me, Uy says.

0281.00001; But Riskowitz, who runs Protea Asset Management out of the US as well as the Riskowitz Value Fund, is on a publicity blitz.
0281.00002; The FM asked why he's decided to go more public now.
0281.00003; We think that the investments we've made and the companies we invested in are doing cool things, [they're] good for SA, employees and shareholders. But the dearth of information … in the media and commentary about us just got to the point where we asked: Why is there such a misunderstanding?
0281.00004; Sure, but you've taken very big bets on companies that not many people would back, like Taste or Trustco. Trustco is a good example of a company that needs PR  -  we can't control their PR messaging. But if you read through the annual report you can build a very strong investment case.
0281.00005; How did you start?
0281.00006; Tyrone Moodley and I started in 2007 as investors in listed companies in SA.
0281.00007; We had started reading about investing as 16-year-old kids and the first thing we discovered was this idea of value investing  -  companies of high quality that are able to compound their underlying intrinsic value  -  and we grew from there. During university we went to interview at the big investment shops for analyst or intern positions and Tyrone and I came back from that process, independently, with the same conclusion: those are great businesses, but it's a different kind of business model that we believed in.
0281.00008; We [looked] for this type of long-term-orientated value investor and couldn't find it. So we said this … must mean there is a big opportunity. Out of university we started Midbrook Lane.
0281.00009; Who backed you?
0281.00010; Friends, family and fools.
0281.00011; We set out to raise R4m.
0281.00012; Of course we raised R400,000.
0281.00013; People said: Come on, guys, you don't know anything, you're young.
0281.00014; But we sort of just went from there.
0281.00015; And as we started our business, we had some good successes and we started to gather some assets. Then in 2009 my green card was approved and the opportunity to go to America was too significant not to pursue. I would tell people what I was doing and they'd say: This is really interesting … but we can't invest as American citizens in Midbrook, so why not start a fund in the US?
0281.00016; So that was the Riskowitz Value Fund.
0281.00017; But how are you actually different to any investor?
0281.00018; We try to find companies that meet [certain] criteria.
0281.00019; No 1: there must be an exceptional jockey.
0281.00020; No 2 is the jockey and the horse.
0281.00021; We only have six investments  -  Taste, Trustco, Calgro, Combined Motor Holdings, Finbond and Conduit.
0281.00022; We've historically only ever ranged between five and 11 [because] the combination of great horse and jockey is rare.
0281.00023; Third is runway: we always said we wanted to be shareholders forever.
0281.00024; We're more like a permanent owner of businesses in the public market.
0281.00025; If you don't sell, how do you raise capital? The advantage of the US market is it's so big and it's more open to alternative structures.
0281.00026; The people on behalf of whom we invest are a very specific niche type of investment crowd. Also, we have a five-year rolling lock-in period. It's a great filtering mechanism.
0281.00027; Is there vast well of untapped US capital wanting to invest in SA?
0281.00028; We have missed out on about R4bn in the past 18 months in our business. Not because of something wrong with the opportunities.
0281.00029; They are not comfortable with expropriation without compensation.
0281.00030; They say: Explain it to us.
0281.00031; They ask: How do we know there's a disincentive to doing bad things? The problem is major uncertainty. Everyone in America is bearish on SA because of the political situation, not because of anything else.
0281.00032; For about six years people have known that Eskom is on the brink  -  so they'll ask: What has been done about it? And I can't tell them.
0281.00033; So they'll say: The government has no plan?
0281.00034; And I'll say: The government plans to split it into three parts. And they'll ask: What more is there?
0281.00035; Foreign investors we talk to are relatively sophisticated and they look at who's investing domestically.
0281.00036; So you look at the stats and they'll say: Hang on, local investors are not investing. I think about the multiplier effects of that capital in SA: that's jobs, that's bigger companies, more companies, and it's not coming.

0285.00001; Reuters|  Sep 25, 2019, 09.28 PM IST  0Comments  Reuters  Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board will decide on the proposals at an extraordinary meeting shortly, the company said.
0285.00002; FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF: Thyssenkrupp said it was preparing to replace Chief Executive Guido Kerkhoff, making him the latest casualty at the German steel-to-submarines conglomerate which has been in crisis mode for more than a year.
0285.00003; The plan to ditch Kerkhoff after 14 months at the helm follows a loss of confidence among key investors, who no longer believe the 51-year old can deliver on a turnaround that includes selling the group's most profitable division, elevators.
0285.00004; It adds to turmoil at a company that has struggled to cope with falling steel prices, a weak car market and a cooling global economy.
0285.00005; Since Kerkhoff became CEO in July 2018, the group has issued four profit warnings. Most importantly, we see an increasing risk surrounding a timely execution of the elevator business strategy, in turn creating further questions over whether the company's stretched balance sheet can be fixed over the next 6-12 months, Credit Suisse analysts wrote, keeping an underperform rating.
0285.00006; Shares in the group were 0.2% lower at 1503 GMT after falling as much as 2.7% earlier.
0285.00007; Kerkhoff is to be replaced for an interim phase of up to 12 months by Supervisory Board Chairwoman Martina Merz, who will face pressure to quickly find a buyer for the elevator business, which is valued at up to 17 billion euros ($18.7 billion), more than twice that of its parent.
0285.00008; Kerkhoff's plan to sell elevators, raise margins and find new ownership structures for Thyssenkrupp's other units, such as car parts and plant engineering, was executed poorly and failed to create momentum, said two people familiar with the matter.
0285.00009; That's why Thyssenkrupp's key owners had to hit the 'emergency brake', one of the sources said, after Thyssenkrupp did not give a reason for Kerkhoff's departure in its statement.
0285.00010; Growing scepticism has been reflected in a 40% share price decline since Kerkhoff became CEO, compounded by two failed restructuring plans under his watch: a spin-off of the capital goods units and a joint venture with Tata Steel.
0285.00011; Adding to the woes was Thyssenkrupp's exclusion from Germany's benchmark DAX index this week.
0285.00012; Lars Foerberg, founding partner of Thyssenkrupp's second-largest shareholder, Cevian, said he fully supported the appointment of Merz, a former Bosch manager who became chairwoman in February.
0285.00013; This echoed remarks by the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach foundation, the biggest shareholder with a 21% stake. If elected as interim CEO, Merz's duties as chairwoman will be taken over on an interim basis by former Siemens board member Siegfried Russwurm, who joined Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board in April. The company said it would recommend that Klaus Keysberg, head of the group's Materials Services business, join the board.
0285.00014; We expect that the new leadership will speed up the transformation process that Thyssenkrupp so urgently needs, and improve the quality of implementation.
0285.00015; We are confident that Thyssenkrupp will now finally get a crystal clear strategy and a well-defined plan of action, Foerberg said. Described as being modest as well as a straight shooter by those who know her, Merz, 56, is expected to speed up an existing turnaround plan.
0285.00016; But the number of seats she holds on steering committees of other companies could draw criticism and has previously resulted in calls to drop some of them.
0285.00017; Merz, a trained engineer, also holds seats on boards at German airline Lufthansa, Swedish truck maker Volvo , automotive supplier SAF Holland and French roofing business Imery SA.
0285.00018; Dirk Sievers, head of Thyssenkrupp's works council and a member of the group's supervisory board, said the group's strategy needed to be implemented faster and more consistently now, adding there would be no change to the existing plans. Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board will decide on the proposals at an extraordinary meeting shortly, the company said.
0285.00019; The realignment of the group announced in May 2019 and unanimously approved by the supervisory board will be systematically continued.
0285.00020; The focus will be on the three areas 'performance first', 'flexible portfolio' and 'efficient organisation', it said. Kerkhoff, who joined Thyssenkrupp as finance chief in 2011, took over as CEO last year following tumultuous weeks during which the conglomerate's former CEO and chairman also left due to mounting investor pressure over strategic issues.
0286.00001; Traders of Micron Technology Inc. stock options are preparing for a bigger-than-expected stock price reaction to fiscal fourth-quarter results, which are scheduled for release after Thursday's closing bell.

0288.00001; Politics  Trudeau promises $40K interest-free loans to make homes energy efficient and safer from severe weather Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau is promising Canadians access to interest-free loans of up to $40,000 to upgrade old furnaces, replace leaky windows or retrofit their homes to make them more energy-efficient and resilient to floods and wildfires caused by climate change.
0288.00002; Liberals offer retrofit program to assist 1.5 million homes with upgrades Kathleen Harris · CBC News ·  Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau says a re-elected Liberal government would offer Canadians an interest-free loan of up to $40,000 to make their homes more energy efficient and resistant to climate change.
0288.00003; Trudeau is in Port Coquitlam, B.C. today to make his party's second climate change action plan announcement of the week  -  a promise to introduce a new program to cut energy bills and fortify homes if he's re-elected. The Liberal Party says the program would offer a free energy audit and would help to retrofit about 1.5 million homes. Homeowners and landlords would be eligible for an interest-free loan of up to $40,000 for eligible green-friendly renovations  -  such as high efficiency doors or windows, rooftop solar panels, basement flood-proofing or insulation.
0288.00004; The Liberals also say they would invest $100 million in skills training to make sure there are enough qualified workers to handle the energy audits, retrofits and net-zero home construction.
0288.00005; It's a win-win-win, Trudeau said. Trudeau said Canada has an obligation as a society to help those living in flood zones, who will face increasingly difficult decisions about whether to rebuild or relocate. This is a conversation we know is only going to become more difficult and more acute for more people over the coming years with the very real impacts of climate change, he said.
0288.00006; Our commitment today is that we will be there with people, supporting them through these difficult moments in their lives as we fight climate change.
0288.00007; Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, meanwhile, used a campaign event in Quebec this morning to highlight his party's promise of a 20 per cent refundable tax credit that could be claimed by anyone who spends between $1,000 and $20,000 on energy-saving home renovations.
0288.00008; The Conservatives say the $900 million measure, first announced by the party in June, would allow Canadians to save  up to $3,800 on renovations every year.
0288.00009; The tax measure is part of the Conservative Party's overall climate plan, which includes a vow to repeal the Liberal government's carbon tax.
0288.00010; The Liberals are also promising to:  Create a low-cost national flood insurance program to help homeowners in high-risk flood zones who don't have adequate insurance protection.
0288.00011; According to the Liberal Party, claims in Canada related to severe weather are four times higher now than in 2008, averaging $1.8 billion a year in the last decade.
0288.00012; Work with provinces and territories to complete flood maps so Canadians understand the risks of buying home in risky areas. Liberals are offering a $150 million investment for that initiative over the next three years.
0288.00013; Develop a national action plan to help homeowners at highest risk of repeat flooding with potential relocation.
0288.00014; Work with stakeholders and experts to design an Employment Insurance Disaster Assistance Benefit to help people whose jobs and livelihoods are negatively affected by disaster.
0288.00015; According to the Liberal Party, the gross cost of the measures would be about $370 million in 2020-21, increasing to $432 million in 2023-24. Costs associated with retrofits and the Net Zero Home Grant would be financed through the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation by drawing down on the Crown corporation's shareholder equity.
0288.00016; Costs for training and flood mapping would be paid out of the government's general revenues, costing an estimated $70 million net in 2020-21, decreasing to $20 million by 2023-24, according to the party. The Liberal Party has not yet released any independent costing analysis of its campaign promises from the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO), as the Conservatives and NDP have done. The party repeatedly has said that further costing will be announced over the course of the campaign.
0288.00017; Earlier today, the Green Party released its fully costed platform with analysis from the PBO.

0288.00019; THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)  Today's announcement is the second in what's expected to be a series of Liberal platform promises related to action on climate change. It's part of the Liberal promise to push Canada to net-zero emissions by 2050.
0288.00020; The European Union and other countries made the same climate pledge at the United Nations in New York City this week. The Liberal Party's plan is to set legally-binding, five-year milestones to reach net-zero emissions in 30 years. The party says the net-zero plan would be based on the advice of scientists, economists and other experts, as well as consultations with Canadians.
0288.00021; Net-zero means some sectors could still emit carbon pollution, but those emissions would be offset by other actions such as planting trees.

0289.00001; Although most engineering institutes have incubation centres, their contribution in hatching successful start-ups has been minimal. This, even though start-ups in recent years have seen a phenomenal rise in funding.

Being the nursery of many start-ups, Stanford has successfully funded innovation, by acquiring stakes in enterprises hatched by alumni - Google, for instance - using the university's resources. Now, Indian universities may be able to do this too.

0289.00006; When an invention or finding is monetised, revenue sharing would be in a 60:40 ratio, with the smaller portion accruing to the academic institution the share of the university won't be allowed to fall below 25%.
0289.00007; This applies to video classes, and MOOCs as well it is only in the case of copyright that the academic institution would enjoy a non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, worldwide licence.

0289.00009; This, even though start-ups in recent years have seen a phenomenal rise in funding.
0289.00010; A financial incentive will prod universities to improve mechanisms for incubating research and entrepreneurship.
0289.00011; A change in policy to favour start-up-fostering colleges can alter this. Indian universities and the government need to follow the Stanford model if Institutes of Eminence are to be nurtured.
