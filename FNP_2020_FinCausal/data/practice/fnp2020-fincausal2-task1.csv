0001.00001; Florida raking in billions as Americans abandon high-tax states By Brittany De LeaEconomic IndicatorsFOXBusiness  video  DeBianchi Real Estate's Samantha DeBianchi gives her take on the new mansion tax in NYC and the great tax exodus. State governments can benefit greatly from an influx of movers  -  enjoying everything from increased tax revenues to new business activity.; 0
0001.00002; Recently, changes to the U.S. tax code have encouraged an increasing number of people to move  -  taking their cash to lower-tax states like Florida.; 0
0001.00003; MORE FROM FOXBUSINESS.COM... As it turns out, however, Florida has been banking on moving trends even prior to the implementation of the new tax law.; 0
0001.00004; According to a new study from LendingTree, which analyzed IRS data from 2016, Florida is the number one largest beneficiary from relocations out of all 50 states  -  by a landslide.; 0
0001.00005; The Sunshine State drew in a net influx of about $17.7 billion in adjusted gross income (AGI)  -  most of which (72 percent) came from those aged 55 and older. It is consistently one of the most popular destinations for retirees due to affordability and low taxes. Florida's $17.7 billion in net AGI dwarves the remaining 19 states that saw a positive net influx of income  -  which combined for a total of $19.4 billion.; 1
0001.00006; South Carolina and another no-income tax state  -  Texas  -  trailed Florida, with net adjusted income totals around $2.25 billion apiece.; 0
0001.00007; Florida is unique in that it also draws a large proportion of higher net-worth individuals  -  more than 85 percent of its net inflow of income came from people earning at least six-figures.; 1
0001.00008; On the flip side, New York lost the largest amount of adjusted gross income from migration, about $8.8 billion. Another high-tax state, Connecticut, had the largest income loss relative to its overall economy  -  at $2.6 billion.; 0
0001.00009; Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and New York lost about half of their income from people earning more than $200,000  -  indicating the wealthy were picking up and leaving.; 1
0001.00010; While the study analyzed data from 2016, this trend has likely only intensified thanks to recent changes to the U.S. tax code. A $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions has caused an exodus from states like New York, Connecticut and California  -  where tax burdens were already onerous  -  to low-tax states like Florida, Texas and Nevada.; 0
0001.00011; CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP  Data from the U.S. Census Bureau showed that while Florida received more movers than any other state last year, New York's outflows to the Sunshine State were the highest  -  63,772 people.; 1
0001.00012; New York had the third-largest outflows of any state, with 452,580 people moving out within the past year. Individuals earning $650,000 can save more than $69,700 in taxes per year by moving from New York to Florida.; 1

0002.00001; BIFA has been advised that Canadian terminals will now release containers to ANY party once the container has been both customs and carrier released, if shipped on an Express Bill of Lading or Sea Waybill. BIFA is led to believe that Carriers release any Full Container Load (FCL) cargo, manifested as Express Bill of Lading or Sea Waybill, automatically to their terminals and as most FCL Consignees customs clear these containers in advance of arrival, terminals will already have the customs release.; 0
0002.00002; As a result of this the Canadian import forwarder can no longer control the release of containers to the ultimate consignee. When FCL cargo is sent to Canada on a carrier's Express BL, due to the previously described situation the Canadian import freight forwarder will not be able to HOLD the release of the container to the ultimate consignee.; 0
0002.00003; As a result, containers where the Canadian agent is expected to secure the sending agents original HBL can be released to the consignee without the agent's knowledge or control.; 0
0002.00004; Consequently, the Canadian agent is unable to secure any charges from the consignee.; 0
0002.00005; It is understood that some Canadian agents have advised that FCL cargo consigned to them should now move on a carriers Original Bill of Lading with an original sent to them to surrender to the carrier in Canada to obtain release of the container. As one agent succinctly put it FCL cargo can no longer move on Express BL's. Some Canadian agents are advising that they are unable to accept any liability on the release of cargo moving on Express BL's.; 0
0002.00006; BIFA's current guidance to Members is to check with your Canadian agents regarding this situation.; 0

0004.00002; Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian  Thomas Cook has ceased trading after talks failed to produce a funding lifeline for the ailing travel company, placing 9,000 British jobs at risk and triggering a huge repatriation effort to bring home 150,000 UK holidaymakers overseas.; 1
0004.00003; The Civil Aviation Authority announced at 2am on Monday morning that the world's oldest holiday company had gone into administration and that all flights and bookings had been cancelled. Thomas Cook Group, including the UK tour operator and airline, has ceased trading with immediate effect, the aviation regulator said in a statement. All Thomas Cook bookings, including flights and holidays, have now been cancelled.; 0
0004.00004; The government and the CAA have triggered the UK's largest ever peacetime repatriation  -  codenamed Operation Matterhorn  -  to bring holidaymakers home. The official administration was timed for the early hours when the largest number of the 94-strong fleet of planes were on the ground.; 0
0004.00005; The Guardian also understands that airlines including British Airways and easyJet will be involved in the airlift for holidaymakers using Thomas Cook, whose destinations range from mainland Europe to north Africa, the Middle East, the US and the Caribbean.; 0
0004.00006; The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Sunday that the government had contingency plans in place for passengers and sought to reassure holidaymakers that they would not end up stuck overseas. The company had appealed to ministers for a bailout but Raab said the government did not systemically step in unless it was in the national interest.; 0
0004.00007; We would wait to see and hope that [Thomas Cook] can continue but in any event, as you would expect, we've got the contingency planning in place to make sure that in any worst-case scenario we can support all those who might otherwise be stranded, Raab told the BBC. A last-ditch meeting at a law firm in central London between Thomas Cook executives and stakeholders including the firm's largest shareholder, Chinese conglomerate Fosun, came to a close after 5pm on Sunday, ending talks that began at 9am.; 0
0004.00008; The tour operator is understood to have made a number of proposals, including asking lenders to reduce a £200m demand for extra funding and for credit card companies to release about £50m of cash they are holding as collateral against Thomas Cook bookings.; 0
0004.00009; Thomas Cook's chief executive, Peter Fankhauserleft the meeting through the City law firm's loading bay flanked by colleagues without saying anything about the deal. He also stayed quiet when asked if he had any message for customers trapped abroad.; 0

0004.00011; The 11th-hour meeting came after the company had agreed a £900m bailout  -  but was then told to find another £200m, which proved a step too far. Meanwhile, Thomas Cook holidaymakers were anxious that they might be evicted from their hotels or charged again for their holidays.; 0

Atol covers holiday accommodation as well as return flights if customers are abroad at the time of a collapse. Future bookings are also protected.; 0
0004.00017; The total cost of holidaymakers' guarantees to be paid by the Atol scheme  -  underwritten by the Civil Aviation Authority watchdog  -  is an estimated £600m now that the company has gone bust.; 1
0004.00018; The business, which also has significant operations in mainland Europe, employs 21,000 people, many in the UK. It has a total of 600,000 people on holiday currently, including British travellers, with Germany and Scandinavia among its major customer bases alongside Britain.; 0
0004.00019; It also operates about 560 shops on UK high streets. Quick guide  Show Hide  Thomas Cook owes its name to a humble and deeply religious 32-year-old cabinet-maker who, one June morning in 1841, hiked the 15 miles from his home in Market Harborough to Leicester, to attend a temperance meeting.; 0
0004.00020; The former Baptist preacher believed that the ills of Victorian society stemmed largely from alcohol and, presumably fatigued from his walk, realised he could deploy the power of Britain's flourishing rail network to help spread the word.; 0
0004.00021; Addressing the temperance meeting, he suggested that a train be hired to carry the movement's supporters to the next meeting in Loughborough. Thus, on 5 July 1841, some 500 passengers travelled by a special train for the 24-mile round trip, paying a shilling apiece.; 1
0004.00022; Over the next few years, Cook laid on ever more trains, introducing thousands of Britons to train travel for the first time.; 0
0004.00023; The first such outing to be run for commercial purposes was a trip to Liverpool in 1845. Over the next decade or so, the business expanded to offer overseas trips, to France, Switzerland, Italy and beyond, to the US, Egypt and India.; 0
0004.00024; His more business-minded son John expanded the tour operator and its reach was such that the government enlisted its expertise in an effort, ultimately in vain, to relieve General Gordon at the siege of Khartoum in 1885. John's three sons inherited the business, which incorporated as Thos Cook & Son Ltd in 1924 and benefited from the increasing ease of international travel. Its first flirtation with collapse came during the second world war, when the government requisitioned some of its assets and it was sold to Britain's railway companies, effectively a nationalisation.; 0
0004.00025; But it boomed in the postwar years as growing prosperity fuelled the appetite for holidays and it returned to private ownership in 1972.; 0
0004.00026; Since then, it has changed hands and changed shape via a series of mergers and takeovers.; 0

0008.00001; President Muhammadu Buhari has disclosed that Nigeria lost an estimated $157.5 billion to illicit financial flows between 2003 and 2012.  Mr Buhari quoted from the 2014 Global Financial Integrity Report in his address to the High-Level National Side-Event organised by the African Union Development Agency and New Partnership for Africa's Development (AUDA-NEPAD) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).; 1
0008.00002; The event held on Wednesday in New York, on the margins of the 74th United Nations General Assembly.; 0
0008.00003; It held under the theme, Promotion of International Cooperation to Combat Illicit Financial Flows and Strengthen Good Practices on Assets Recovery and Return to Foster Sustainable Development.; 0
0008.00004; The Nigerian leader noted that such massive loss of assets, resulted in dearth of resources to fund public services or to alleviate poverty, in the country. According to him, This is why, as Africans, we have no choice but to break the back of corruption. Acknowledging lack of sufficient capital and corruption as impediments to socio-economic development of the continent, the president emphatically restated his administration's anti-corruption campaign:  That is why our government has made it a war we intend to win.; 0
0008.00005; We will give all it takes to ensure there is no hiding place for purveyors of corrupt practices who are truly enemies of the people.; 0
0008.00006; Stressing the need to strengthen good practices on asset recovery and return, President Buhari said that, In the last five years, our government has made significant progress to curb corruption, adding: We have recovered millions of dollars stolen from our country. He noted, however, that there are still a lot of other funds that are stuck in foreign bank accounts due to international laws, different jurisdictions and justice systems that make it difficult for repatriation.; 0
0008.00007; Describing Illicit Financial Flows as illegal movement of funds from one country to another, President Buhari lamented that, These flows deplete Africa's internally generated revenues, foreign exchange earnings, reduce tax revenues, drain natural resources, facilitate corruption and stunt private sector development.; 0
0008.00008; Citing tax avoidance as another form of illicit financial flow, he quoted the Tax Justice Network and the International Monetary Fund to have estimated over $200 billion per year as being lost by developing countries when multinational enterprises do not pay taxes in the countries where they made the profit.; 1
0008.00009; This amount is significantly higher than the annual development aid received by these countries which are estimated to be about US$143 billion, he added.; 0
0008.00010; Commending the organisers of the meeting designed to finding pragmatic ways to promote international cooperation to combat illicit financial flows and strengthen good practices on asset recovery and return, as an arm of sustainable development policies in Africa, President Buhari also lauded their shared commitment to root out corruption from our continent. According to the Nigerian President, I am motivated by the belief that, if we join hands, we can bequeath to our children an Africa that is not defined by corruption.; 0
0008.00011; Emphasizing the imperative of international cooperation towards stemming the incidence of illegal financial flows, President Buhari said, Any lasting solution to the above challenges will require international cooperation and coordination, of African countries and their international counterparts.; 0
0008.00012; This is one reason why the Nigerian government supports this initiative of AUDA/NEPAD and remains committed until we ensure that there are no safe-havens for stolen assets from Africa, he declared. On his expectations of the outcome of the meeting, the Nigerian leader said:  I have high expectations for this meeting. At the end of the deliberations, I expect other African leaders, to see the pragmatic ideas on how to strengthen our anti-corruption institutions to reduce or effectively eliminate Illicit Financial Flows.; 0
0008.00013; We need ideas on how to return the stolen assets to their countries of origin.; 0
0008.00014; We also need strategies on how to plug the loopholes that enable companies to avoid paying commensurate taxes in their countries of operations. You should deliberate on practical ideas to enhance global acceptable assets tracing and freezing, and boost the recovery governance framework.; 0
0008.00015; Wishing the meeting also attended by the Presidents of Zambia and Ethiopia successful discussions, President Buhari said he looked forward to reading its resolutions and recommendations.; 0

0009.00001; Why a Casino Can't Fund Chicago's Pensions There's nothing wrong with a casino in Chicago  -  but counting on it to pay our bills is like playing the slots for rent money.; 0
0009.00002; By Edward McClelland  Published today at 7:00 a.m. Launch gallery  Horseshoe Casino in Hammond, Indiana Abel Uribe/Chicago Tribune  When my grandmother found out I was playing the horses, she called me up to try to teach me a lesson. I can still hear her bellowing into the phone: You can't win gambling!; 0
0009.00003; I didn't listen to that advice, and Mayor Lori Lightfoot isn't listening, either. The mayor really, really seems to believe a casino is the answer to the city's fiscal problems.; 0
0009.00004; Lightfoot is so convinced that gambling will bail out Chicago's beleaguered budget that she's threatening to raise property taxes if she doesn't get one. [W]e are pursuing a Chicago casino that creates a dedicated revenue stream to pay for our pension costs, Lightfoot said in her State of the City address last month.; 0
0009.00005; If we get the tax structure right, this will … create thousands of jobs … help fund the State's capital plan … and stop the flow of over $200 million in gaming revenue to Indiana.; 1
0009.00006; If we don't secure this casino and the revenue it creates, she continued, we will be forced to make painful choices on finding other revenue sources.; 0
0009.00007; There's only one city whose fortunes have been transformed by casino gambling, and that city is Las Vegas  -  once a desert water stop and now an international tourist trap.; 0
0009.00008; When you put a casino in an established city, it ends up sucking money out of the locals' pockets, while generating just enough revenue to pay for its own maintenance. Casinos can be big revenue generators, but putting them in the middle of a city creates a lot of problems, says Saqib Bhatti, co-director of the Action Center on Race and the Economy, who has studied the gaming industry.; 0
0009.00009; They are a huge drain on public services. For example, the number of 911 calls to casinos is astronomical.; 0
0009.00010; Building a Horseshoe Casino in Baltimore was supposed to be the answer to that city's budget problems, but its revenues have been declining due to statewide competition, according to the Baltimore Brew:  When Horseshoe opened in August 2014, [Mayor] Stephanie Rawlings-Blake promised that revenues from the casino would reduce the city's property tax rate, fund school construction, pay for recreation centers and bankroll local community projects. Since then, the small fees that Horseshoe pays to lease city land have had no impact on the city's property tax rate or on public construction.; 0
0009.00011; The only sizable cash flow has gone to the Baltimore Casino Local Development Council (BLDC), with the lion's share of those funds paying for city services that chiefly benefit the casino. BLDC's 2018 spending budget of $7.4 million, for example, includes more than $1.6 million for police protection around the casino, $358,000 for medic services, $435,000 for supplemental garbage collection, $540,000 to staff a mayoral employment center, and $2 million for infrastructure improvements around the casino.; 1
0009.00012; When Marylanders voted to approve casino gambling, they were promised its revenue would fund schools. In fact, the money just replaced other revenue streams until voters approved a constitutional amendment requiring casino money to supplement existing education funds.; 0
0009.00013; In the '90s, Detroit built casinos to compete with those across the river in Windsor, Canada. Their revenue ended up accounting for 11 percent of the city's budget, but it wasn't enough to prevent the largest municipal bankruptcy in American history, in 2013.; 1
0009.00014; Adds Michael Belsky, executive director of the Center for Municipal Finance at the University of Chicago: Casino revenues can be volatile if you have competition, if you have lotteries or video poker. Also, a casino is not a progressive way to balance the city's budget.; 0
0009.00015; Lightfoot boasts of eliminating fines and fees that hurt low-income and working class families, like the one I grew up in.; 0
0009.00016; But low-income and working class families are one of regional casinos' target markets. Often casinos pull from the local population, and it actually ends up being a regressive form of taxation, the same way that lotteries are, says Bhatti.; 0
0009.00017; You're much more likely to draw from poor folks.; 0
0009.00018; It's true that Midwestern casinos aren't exactly James Bond movies, or even Martin Scorsese movies. They're more like an episode of Roseanne spinoff The Conners: endless banks of glowing slot machines fed by busloads of AARP members.; 0
0009.00019; Even if Chicago builds a downtown casino, it's not going to become an after-hours destination for young Google employees. I wasted a good portion of my late youth at the racetrack, and as a college-educated thirtysomething, I was solidly in the minority. A Chicago casino is not going to become a tourist attraction, either.; 0

0009.00022; It means that if you need the money, you shouldn't be gambling  -  and it could be applied to Lightfoot's vision of a casino funding Chicago's pensions.; 0
0009.00023; The financials of the plan are even scaring off potential operators.; 0
0009.00024; The city wants a 33-1/3 percent tax on Adjusted Gross Receipts (the total earned from wagerers after prize money is doled out) to pay for police and fire pensions. A study by the Illinois Gaming Board found that such a tax would only allow a casino to turn a 1 or 2 percent profit, which is not an acceptable rate of return for a casino operator.; 1

0010.00001; September 18, 2019 04:26 AM  UK dealer group Pendragon scraps dividend, offers grim outlook Yadarisa Shabong  Reuters  More  Print  LONDON -- British auto dealer Pendragon canceled its dividend and issued a dismal forecast for the year after deep price cuts to offload used car inventory pushed it to a first-half loss. In the latest abrupt management change this year, the dealership chain named a new executive chairman to oversee the two senior executives running the company in the absence of a CEO and said its non-executive chairman would step down.; 0
0010.00002; The company, which operates the Evans Halshaw, Stratstone, Quickco and Car Store brands, has already seen two CEOs leave this year - the last after just three months in the position. It has also felt the pain of the wider British car industry, which has seen vehicle sales fall amid uncertainty over Britain's impending exit from the European Union, stricter emissions regulations and a shift towards sales of electric or hybrid cars.; 0
0010.00003; The company said it expects an annual loss at the bottom of its expectations, blaming weak consumer confidence due to heightened political and Brexit uncertainties. We are not anticipating any improvement in this for the rest of our financial year and are closely monitoring market conditions and customer behavior particularly during the important trading month of September, Pendragon said. Mirroring the troubles of its rival Lookers, which issued a profit warning in July, Pendragon also said challenges would continue into the second half.; 0
0010.00004; Shares of the London-listed company fell 13 percent to a more than 7-1/2-year low of 9.50 pence.; 0
0010.00005; The stock has lost more than half of its value so far this year.; 0
0010.00006; The company reported an underlying pretax loss of 32.2 million pounds ($40.22 million) for the first-half, compared with a profit of 28.4 million pounds a year earlier.; 0
0010.00007; Its biggest unit - franchised UK motor - incurred underlying operating losses of 7.7 million pounds, compared with an operating profit of 31.8 million pounds a year ago.; 0
0010.00008; Losses at its Car Store segment widened to 19.1 million pounds. To revive its loss-making Car Store unit, Pendragon said it will shut 22 of 34 store locations identified as the worst performing in the second half of the year, leading to 300 job cuts.; 1
0010.00009; We view a significant retrenching of the Car Store strategy as a necessary first step towards establishing a credible recovery strategy and underpinning forecast stability, Jefferies, which rates Pendragon 'hold', wrote in a note. The company said the process to recruit a new Chief Executive Officer continues in addition to searching for a new non-executive chairman. As part of the latest management changes, non-Executive Chairman Chris Chambers will step down and Bill Berman takes on the new role of executive chairman on an interim basis from Oct. 1.  Chief Operating Officer Martin Casha and Chief Financial Officer Mark Willis, who have been running the firm on a daily basis, will report to Berman, a company spokesperson said.; 0

June 2018 Institutional Investor Trading Behavior around Brexit, the US Election, and the Swiss Franc Floor June 2018 In this inaugural JPMorgan Chase Institute report on financial markets, we examined three recent events that had major impacts on foreign exchange (FX) markets: The decision by the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to remove their floor on the Swiss Franc vs.; 0
0012.00023; Euro exchange rate (EUR/CHF): on January 15, 2015, at 9:30 a.m. GMT, the SNB abandoned its floor on the EUR/CHF exchange rate via a surprise press release. The announcement shocked the FX market - EUR/CHF dropped 12.3 percent over the next few hours.; 1
0012.00024; The Brexit referendum: on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) held a referendum on whether the UK should remain a member of the European Union (EU).; 0
0012.00025; The Leave win led to an 11 percent drop in GBP/USD overnight.; 1
0012.00026; The 2016 US Presidential Election: On November 8, 2016, the United States (US) held its Presidential Election.; 0
0012.00027; The unexpected Trump victory led to an 8.3 percent rise in USD/MXN overnight.; 1
0012.00028; All three events shared one important quality - they had unexpected outcomes that led to the largest one-day moves in these three exchange rates in the last 20 years - that made them ideal candidates for research aimed at building a better understanding of institutional investor trading behavior. With this research objective in mind, we examined institutional investor trades in FX markets in the days and hours leading up to, during, and after each event.; 0
0012.00029; We analyzed total trading volumes (a measure of trading activity) and net flows (a measure of risk transferred) across all institutional investors in our sample, and then examined net flows at the investor sector and region level. Finally, we looked at transactions within each investor type to observe within-sector variation in trading behavior.; 0
0012.00030; Data Visualization Discover how various types of institutional investors reacted to three recent events that led to the largest one-day moves in the relevant currencies in the last 20 years: the removal of the minimum exchange rate policy by the Swiss National Bank (SNB), the Brexit referendum, and the 2016 US Election.; 0
0012.00031; See a timeline of how each event unfolded as well as net flows for each investor type throughout the event days as the news broke and exchange rates repriced sharply.; 0
0012.00032; Data We constructed a unique, de-identified trade-level data asset that includes all available institutional investor transactions where the Markets Division of J.P.; 0
0012.00033; Morgan's Corporate & Investment Bank acted as the market maker.; 0
0012.00034; This data asset allows for a highly detailed look at the behavior of institutional investors across all regions and in all asset classes, as our data are more granular, timely, and comprehensive than publicly available data.; 0
0012.00035; For this report we narrowed our focus to a sample of FX transactions that took place around three specific events.; 0
0012.00036; Finding One FX trading volumes for hedge funds, asset managers, and banks spiked during the three events.; 0
0012.00037; In contrast, volumes for the corporate, pension/insurance, and public/other investor sectors barely increased. While overall FX trading volumes spiked, not all investor sectors increased their trading activity relative to their average daily volume. Trading volumes from hedge funds, asset managers, and banks (the active investor sectors) were particularly elevated on the event day itself.; 0
0012.00038; In contrast, corporate, pension/insurance, and public/other investors (the less-active investor sectors) showed little change in trading volumes on the three event days relative to their average daily volumes, despite the largest one-day moves in the relevant currencies in 20 years. Finding Two Institutional investors traded significant amounts of FX risk during the events, but their net flows alone cannot explain the sharp exchange rate movements during the repricing periods.; 0
0012.00039; Our data show that net flows, or risk transferred, by institutional investors during each event was large. However, net flows coincident with the sharp moves in exchange rates were no larger than net flows that took place after exchange rates stabilized, indicating that the exchange rate moves just after the news broke were much larger than net flows alone would dictate. Market liquidity for the three currencies we examined was likely lower immediately after the news broke, and this may partially account for the disproportionate impact of net flows during the repricing periods.; 0
0012.00040; Only hedge funds consistently transferred risk immediately after news broke and as currencies repriced sharply. Other investors transferred risk but only after exchange rates stabilized.; 0
0012.00041; Hedge funds traded immediately after news broke and exchange rates began to reprice, transferring large amounts of risk during periods of high exchange rate volatility during all three events.; 0
0012.00042; In doing so, hedge funds participated in the establishment of the post-news equilibrium market price.; 0
0012.00043; Other investor sectors transferred risk only after market prices had stabilized.; 0
0012.00044; These results imply that market makers established a new equilibrium exchange rate without the benefit of net flow information from all the investor sectors and regions.; 0
0012.00045; Finding Four The active investor sectors played different roles in each event: During the SNB event, they all bought CHF, trading in the direction of the prevailing move in exchange rates during the Brexit event their net flows were mixed and during the US Election event they bought MXN, trading against the prevailing move in exchange rates.; 0
0012.00046; Hedge funds, asset managers, and banks bought CHF as it appreciated sharply in the minutes after the minimum exchange rate policy was removed, leaving market makers as the only market participants selling CHF during this critical period. In contrast, the active investor sectors had a mixed reaction after Brexit, as their net flows reflected both buying and selling of GBP.; 0
0012.00047; During the US Election event, these three investor sectors were buying MXN as it depreciated, trading against the prevailing direction of the exchange rate. It is likely that the active investor sectors were all buying CHF after the SNB event because the surprise announcement did not allow them to prepare.; 0
0012.00048; While the outcomes were unexpected, the timing of the Brexit referendum and the US Election were well known, giving investors the opportunity to transact ahead of the events and prepare for all possible outcomes.; 0
0012.00049; Within each investor sector, there was considerable variation in trading behavior during each event.; 0
0012.00050; Regardless of the magnitude of the net flows at the sector level, in a given time interval, there was actually a significant amount of risk being transferred in both directions by investors within that sector.; 0
0012.00051; This within-sector variation refutes the commonly held perception that all investors in a particular sector transacted in the same direction at the same time during these three events.; 0
0012.00052; Finding Six Banks and hedge funds traded higher volumes outside of their normal business hours and outside of a currency's local market other investor sectors did not. Bank and hedge fund trading volumes spiked compared to average volumes during the overnight hours for both GBP and MXN, a marked change in trading behavior. These two investor sectors were also the most willing to trade outside of their normal business hours.; 0
0012.00053; Asset manager trading volumes only spiked during US trading hours, 10 to 20 hours after the news broke for both the Brexit referendum and the US Election. Conclusion In this report, we examined the trading behavior of institutional investors in the hours and days leading up to, during, and after three events that had major impacts on foreign exchange markets.; 0
0012.00054; Our results are informative along two dimensions: financial market stability and central bank communications.; 0
0012.00055; Our analysis shows that the institutional investor reactions to major market events, as reflected in trading volumes and risk transferred, varied in pace and size across sectors.; 0
0012.00056; The slower risk transfer response of asset managers, corporates, pension/insurance companies, and public sector investors to the three news events that changed perceptions of the fundamental value of each currency suggests these four investor sectors did not participate in the price discovery process.; 0
0012.00057; Furthermore, these same four investor sectors did not transact against the prevailing move in exchange rates during the volatile repricing periods of these three events, contradicting the popularly held narrative that long-only investors with long-term investment horizons act as a stabilizing force during market dislocations. Hedge funds and market makers played an especially significant role in the market ecosystem during these three events.; 0
0012.00058; Hedge funds transacted actively in FX markets just after each news event broke and during volatile conditions, participating in the establishment of a post-event market equilibrium.; 0
0012.00059; For all three events, market makers reconciled news about the fundamental value of the relevant currency with net flows, adjusted market liquidity, and established a post-event equilibrium exchange rate. When deliberating policies that limit the trading activity of market makers or hedge funds, policymakers can use our results regarding the differential roles institutional investors played in establishing a post-event market equilibrium exchange rate to weigh this factor against any other relevant considerations.; 0
0012.00060; Company policies or regulations that limit the trading activity of institutional investors to their normal business hours or the local market of a currency may prevent these investors from accessing liquidity and mitigating their risk during market-moving events. Limitations to after-hours trading may also reduce market efficiency as markets might take longer to reach a new equilibrium price.; 0
0012.00061; With the appropriate safeguards, controls, and security in place, after-hours trading capabilities could be a useful addition for some institutional investors. While a role for capital controls as a tool for enhancing financial stability in certain instances has gained popularity over the last 10 years, our results imply that strict controls on FX flows may act as a hindrance to market efficiency during times of instability and prevent domestic investors from accessing liquidity abroad.; 0
0012.00062; Our results could be helpful to central banks as they pursue the appropriate balance between their increasing tendency toward transparency in communicating policy actions and other critical factors, such as maintaining their credibility.; 0
0012.00063; Enacting unexpected policy changes via a surprise announcement (like the SNB event) may not allow investors to adjust their risk in advance which in turn leads to directional net flows that could amplify price movements.; 0
0012.00064; When choosing the most appropriate method to communicate policy changes, policymakers can use these results to help weigh market expectations with respect to both the timing of announcements and the outcome in the context of other pertinent factors and their desired market impacts.; 0
0012.00065; When deliberating unconventional policy measures that directly change the price of financial instruments, policymakers should carefully consider how they will unwind the policy.; 0
0012.00066; For example, policies such as the SNB's minimum exchange rate take pricing power away from the market and therefore can distort the incentives and, in turn, the behavior of market participants.; 0
0012.00067; To the extent that policymakers want to unwind such a policy and return pricing power to the market with minimal unintended market impacts, the behavior induced by the distorted incentives can become a complicating factor.

0013.00001; Article Summary Independent candidates Kais Saied and Nabil Karoui have emerged from the first round of Tunisia's presidential race. REUTERS/Muhammad Hamed An election official empties a ballot box during the Tunisian presidential election in Tunis, Tunisia, Sept. 15, 2019.; 0
0013.00002; In an election marked by low voter turnout, initial results suggest that populist candidates Nabil Karoui and Kais Saied have made it into the second round of voting. While the initial result is open to legal challenges, Tunisia's electoral oversight body confirmed private polling that indicated retired law professor Saied had won the first round of voting, followed by jailed television boss Karoui.; 0
0013.00003; Saied and Karoui's passage to the next round of voting, scheduled for November, is the most emphatic rejection of Tunisia's political class since the revolution of 2011.; 0
0013.00004; Many of Tunisia's sacred cows have fallen, from technocrat Prime Minister Youssef Chahed to Defense Minister Abdelkarim Zbidi and moderate Islamist Ennahda's Abdelfattah Mourou, all of whom are perceived as having presided over the country's gradual decline and fall.   I want the government to provide jobs and money to young people for projects, said Khalil Mlouki, a univeristy graduate who was among the 54% of Tunisians to withhold their vote.; 1
0013.00005; Mlouki, who has been unemployed since 2015, explained, The current generation of politicians is no good.; 0

0013.00008; News of the death of Chadlia Saïda Farhat , the wife of deceased President Beji Caid Essebsi, whose own passing prompted Sunday's vote, gave the sense of an old order giving way to an untested new one.; 0
0013.00009; The sense of change was enhanced by reports of the grave illness of Tunisia's former autocrat, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , who is reportedly being treated for prostate cancer in Saudi Arabian exile.; 0
0013.00010; Much of Tunisia's rejection of its political class is understandable. After a 2011 revolution in the name of jobs and freedom, for many, the democratic systems have not delivered on their promises. Unemployment, one of the main drivers of rural discontent in 2010, has only increased.; 0
0013.00011; In 2010 , joblessness stood a little over 13%. Today, it sits at 15.3% .; 0
0013.00012; With every month that passes, the cost of living rises as the value of the national currency, the dinar, falls. Institutions intended to protect the country's democracy, such as the Constitutional Court, remain largely stillborn, while in parliament, parties remain locked in perpetual squabbling.; 0
0013.00013; Progress remains elusive on all fronts.   By the time of the campaign, squabbling among Tunisia's 200-plus political parties had left many feeling disenfranchised.; 0
0013.00014; At first there was disinterest, political analyst Youssef Cherif told Al-Monitor, but when the actual campaign started, especially with the multi-candidate debates, people started paying attention. However, anticipating the low turnout of later that day, Cherif concluded, most people are worried about their economic situation and complain that politicians can't change their lives.; 0
0013.00015; The priority of the next president (and government) is to reawaken the people's interest in politics.; 0
0013.00016; Saied and Karoui both look likely to achieve that end.; 0
0013.00017; Karoui has been held in Mornague prison on charges of tax evasion and money laundering since his arrest on Aug. 23.; 0
0013.00018; Denied participation in the country's landmark presidential debates  and the opportunity to interact with his electoral base, Karoui nevertheless appears to have outpolled his establishment rivals. Pitching himself as the anti-system candidate, Karoui has made significant use of broadcasts featuring his delivery of aid to the country's poorest while simultaneously railing against the failings of an uncaring government, especially Chahed.; 0
0013.00019; Repeated official harassment, from having his offices raided by armed police in May to coming within inches of being excluded from the race entirely after parliament passed an amendment , only served to cement the perception of Karoui as the ultimate opponent of the status quo. Karoui remained in the race when the former president refused to sign the bill, and his reputation as a modern-day Robin Hood persists.; 0
0013.00020; Cast as a political prisoner by his supporters, one parliamentary candidate from his Heart of Tunisia Party went so far as to frame him as the Nelson Mandela of Tunisia. Saied speaks to a similar vein of discontent within Tunisian society. Though his is a more dispassionate tone, he offers a no less radical solution.; 0

0015.00001; SÓLHEIMAJÖKULL GLACIER, Iceland  -  To first-time visitors, it is a picturesque sight: a large lagoon dotted with kayakers and framed by lush green hills and an imposing, snake-like glacier.; 0
0015.00002; But to Sigurrós Arnardóttir, a master's student in glacial geology at the University of Iceland, the view is horrifying for its constant reminder that climate change is destroying glaciers and causing sea levels to rise.; 0
0015.00003; Standing at the water's edge, Arnardóttir, a researcher and guide at Iceland's Sólheimajökull glacier, describes how the lagoon - a product of glacial runoff - didn't exist 10 years ago. This was all just ice. Rising temperatures mean that Sólheimajökull is melting, receding annually by the length of an Olympic swimming pool.; 0
0015.00004; In summer months, Arnardóttir says the glacier loses almost two feet of ice per week.; 0
0015.00005; Now the lagoon is 230 feet deep in parts. As it gets bigger, water seeps underneath the glacier, accelerating the melt.; 0
0015.00006; Richard Engel and Sigurros Arnardottir, a masters student in glacial geology at the University of Iceland, atop the Solheimajokull Glacier in Iceland.Charlotte Gardiner  I have kind of a love-hate relationship with the lagoon because it just screams climate change, Arnardóttir adds.; 0
0015.00007; Oddur Sigurðsson, a glaciologist at the Icelandic Meteorological Office, forecasts that all of Iceland's 300 or so named glaciers will melt within 200 years, raising global sea levels by 1 centimeter (0.4 of an inch).; 1
0015.00008; Worldwide, 390 billion tons of glacial ice melts annually, contributing about a third to the rise in global sea levels, according to a scientific paper in the journal Nature this year.; 1
0015.00009; In 2014, Sigurðsson declared another Icelandic glacier, known as Okjökull, dead. In August he and about 100 others  -  including Iceland's environmentalist prime minister  -  held a symbolic funeral at the site of its glacial remains.; 0
0015.00010; Another 55 glaciers have disappeared by Sigurðsson's count.; 0
0015.00011; Mitigating climate change is one of the top priorities of the government, Guðmundur Ingi Guðbrandsson, Iceland's environment minister, told NBC News. We need to scale up our efforts and step up our game when it comes to solving the climate crisis. Iceland has pledged to cut its emissions by 40% by 2030 and aims to be carbon neutral by 2040.; 1
0015.00012; Perhaps the most promising example of how Icelanders are working to cut their carbon footprint lies about 70 miles northwest of Sólheimajökull. Scientists at the Hellisheidi Power Station, the world's third-largest geothermal power plant, have developed a process to capture carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, and inject it into rock. The method  -  now five years old  -  has cut the plant's CO2 emissions by a third and researchers there are hoping that it will be adopted elsewhere.; 0
0015.00013; Studded with volcanoes, Iceland gets about a quarter of its electricity from geothermal power: Hot rock heats rainwater underground, which, when brought to the surface, powers turbines to make electricity.; 0
0015.00014; But the steam produced by the turbines contains some CO2.; 0
0015.00015; The process, known as CarbFix, involves extracting CO2 from the steam and showering it with water to create carbonated water.; 0
0015.00016; It is then pumped underground into porous basalt rock, mineralizing in about two years  -  significantly faster than other carbon-capture and storage methods.; 0
0015.00017; The lagoon at the base the Solheimajokull Glacier in Iceland.Charlotte Gardiner  The result is something that stays buried underground as rock forever, says Edda Aradóttir, CarbFix's project manager. Unlike other CO2 storage methods, it doesn't need to be monitored for leaks.; 0
0015.00018; Aradóttir believes that as the process improves it will turn the plant carbon neutral.; 0
0015.00019; She would like to see other polluters, including aluminum plants, adopt CarbFix to neutralize their emissions.; 0
0015.00020; In June, representatives from big industrial companies in Iceland committed to try it out. Iceland is unique in Europe in being able to do that, thanks to plentiful basalt, says Stuart Haszeldine, a geosciences professor at the University of Edinburgh.; 0
0015.00021; The method is attracting interest from others in the field. Climeworks, a Swiss company that pioneered direct air capture of CO2, is testing at the Hellisheidi Power Station.; 0
0015.00022; But CarbFix is still small scale, storing 12,000 tons of CO2 emitted by the plant each year.; 0
0015.00023; By contrast, a gas power plant emits about 800,000 tons of CO2 annually. Critics question if the CarbFix method can be scaled.; 0
0015.00024; Cost is the biggest hurdle: Without incentives like tax credits for storing CO2, there isn't much reason for emitters to adopt it. There is no price on polluting, Haszeldine said.; 0
0015.00025; The lagoon at the base the Solheimajokull Glacier in Iceland.Charlotte Gardiner  Others argue that carbon-capture strategies have little prospect of meaningfully reducing emissions and that policymakers should instead focus on expanding renewables.; 0
0015.00026; Back at Sólheimajökull, Arnardóttir can't help but feel despondent about the melting glaciers. This upsets me every time I come here, she says, pointing to a runoff stream of melted ice.; 0
0015.00027; The glaciers, she says, are almost just like big living things. It feels like they're bleeding. More tonight on NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt, as part of NBC News' week-long series Climate in Crisis.; 0

Jamo today granted Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel authority to proceed with submitting subpoenas for court entry in the Attorney General's ongoing investigation of the Me Too Kits Company.; 0
0016.00003; Nessel warned the company on August 29 that it was in violation of several sections of Michigan's Consumer Protection Act.   A Notice of Intended Action was issued the same day, giving the company an opportunity to immediately cease and desist from engaging in unlawful business practices.; 0
0016.00004; Although its website has been down in recent days, the Me Too Kits Company is marketing a sexual assault evidence kit, described as a sexual assault evidence kit for at-home use. The do-it-yourself, at-home evidence kit was first brought to Nessel's attention by career sexual assault prosecutors who were alerted to it by a Title IX coordinator.; 0
0016.00005; Sexual assault evidence collection kits are free in Michigan to those who seek medical attention for a sexual assault, said Nessel.; 0
0016.00006; Not only would this so-called 'evidence kit' fail to address the health needs of many sexual assault survivors, but it would completely compromise critical evidence needed to hold an assailant accountable by failing to ensure proper chain of custody.    Medical forensic exams also include photographs, documenting injuries and conducting a thorough anatomical investigation by a qualified professional in an appropriate setting, added Nessel. While the company's attorneys have spoken with assistant attorneys general in the department's Corporate Oversight Division, there has been no agreement as to the resolution of Nessel's concerns that the company was engaging in several unfair trade practices made unlawful by the Michigan Consumer Protection Act, including: Representing that services have sponsorship, approval, characteristics, ingredients, uses, benefits, or quantities that they do not Causing a probability of confusion or of misunderstanding as to the legal rights, obligations, or remedies of a party to a transaction.; 0

0031.00001; Accounting is the process of recording all business transactions, and accounting reports are a numerical representation of the performance of a business. Part of these accounting reports is the tax liability, and given the significance of taxation, avoiding recording this data can have severe consequences for a business. Many new businesses are not aware of the meaning of tax liability and the significance of staying legally compliant.; 0
0031.00002; While juggling different business expenses, owners now have to ensure that their venture stays on top of tax liability.; 0
0031.00003; Before we go about elaborating on the significance of tax liability, here are some reasons why it is crucial.; 0
0031.00004; What is Tax Liability?; 0
0031.00005; Tax liability quite simply put is the amount you owe to your local tax authorities.; 0
0031.00006; Let's put it this way, the tax liability is a legally binding debt to a creditor, and both individuals and businesses can have tax liabilities.; 0
0031.00007; In accounting procedures, tax liabilities are recorded under the current liability section. The section records short-term debts you must pay within a year.; 0
0031.00008; A business generally records short-term liabilities from normal business operations. All companies, therefore, record tax liabilities with other current debts on your small business balance sheet. Consequences of ignoring the tax liability in comparison to other forms of short-term debts are enormous.; 0
0031.00009; Inability to pay a tax liability can result in back taxes, tax lien penalties, and even jail time. If you are not able to pay taxes due to monetary constraints, working out a payment agreement may help out.; 0
0031.00010; Now that you are aware of what tax liability is, here are some forms of tax liabilities faced by owners of small business.; 0
0031.00011; Your business can earn tax liabilities from many taxable events.; 0
0031.00012; A taxable event is a transaction or a deal that results in tax liability, these events include earning taxable income, making sales, and issuing payroll.; 0
0031.00013; The state is responsible for deciding which event is taxable and the degree of tax liability the event holds. You may also have additional tax liabilities, other than the ones mentioned here, such as franchise or excise tax.; 0
0031.00014; However, we have decided to elaborate upon tax liabilities relevant to small businesses only. 1. Earned Income Tax Liability This is one of the most common forms of tax liabilities.; 0
0031.00015; Working individuals are required to pay federal income tax the tax may also include state and local income taxes on their earnings.; 0
0031.00016; To pay back the income tax liability, employers withhold income from the wages of their employees.; 0
0031.00017; However, owners of small business don't have wages, and if you don't earn wages income tax is not deducted from your earnings. The earned tax liability, at times, also includes tax from your business's income.; 0
0031.00018; The owner of a company can pay earned income tax liabilities by paying segments of tax payments throughout the year.; 0
0031.00019; 2. Business Tax Liability All businesses and corporations are required to pay taxes on the profit they earn.; 0
0031.00020; It is the government's way of raising revenue for themselves.; 0
0031.00021; However, fortunately for small businesses registering the business as a sole proprietorship, partnership, S corporation, or LLC, you enjoy pass-through taxation.; 0
0031.00022; Pass-through entities are entities that are not liable to reduce the effects of double taxation. Such entities are not eligible for paying income taxes at the corporate level.; 0
0031.00023; This means that in pass-through taxation, business taxes pass through your business and onto you. Things are different, however, when you register your business as a corporation.; 0
0031.00024; In addition to paying the individual tax, you are eligible to pay corporate tax on your earnings. 3. Self-Employment Tax Liability People who are owners of a business or an entity are responsible for paying for the self-employment tax liability. You see, working individuals are responsible for paying social security and medicare taxes on their earnings.; 0
0031.00025; Employees working in an organization face an automatic deduction of these taxes from their income.; 0
0031.00026; The inference from the wages is made with the help of FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) tax, which is an employer and employee tax. All small business owners are a subject to a tax liability, unless of course, their business is incorporated.; 0
0031.00027; The tax basically covers both the employer and employee portion of the Social Security and Medicare taxes. The self-employment tax liability is 15.3% of the net earnings.; 1
0031.00028; Just like earned income, the user can pay self-employment taxes through estimated tax payments. 4.; 0
0031.00029; Payroll Tax Liability If a small business owner has the luxury of hiring employees, it is responsible for withholding, filing, and remitting payroll taxes.; 0
0031.00030; The money that is withheld from employees and the money you spend as the employer are part of your payroll tax liability.; 0
0031.00031; All business owners must withhold federal, state, and local income taxes and FICA tax from employee wages. All employers are required to contribute an equal amount for FICA tax for each employee.; 0
0031.00032; The user is also expected to pay federal and state unemployment taxes. The combination of income, unemployment, and FICA taxes are part of the payroll tax liability.; 0
0031.00033; The user must deposit these taxes with the IRS according to the depositing schedule.; 0
0031.00034; 5. Sales Tax Liability All businesses sell either products or services to their customers, when you do so, you are eligible for adding the amount of sales tax to the final price you quote.; 0
0031.00035; The final price you quote to the buyer is the sales tax, and after collecting sales tax, the next step is to ensure the remittance of the tax to the state or local government.; 0
0031.00036; Sales tax is a percentage of the total customer's bill the rate differs on where the business has a physical appearance. 6. Capital Gains Tax Liability The owner of a business has a capital gains tax liability if the company sells an asset or an investment for a profit.; 0
0031.00037; Capital gains tax accounts for the gain you earn from the transaction.; 0
0031.00038; The gain is the difference between the price of the asset at the time of purchase and sale. Subtracting the two results is the gain you earn from the sale of the asset.; 0
0031.00039; 7. Property Tax Liability Businesses that own a real state and are managing their operations from a location they own are liable to pay the property tax liability.; 0
0031.00040; Property tax rates vary drastically, the tax liability that you owe depends directly on the value of the property.; 0
0031.00041; The government will reassess the tax rate per year and multiply it with the market value of the property to get the final value of the property tax liability. The tax liabilities mentioned above are the ones common to owners of new businesses.; 0
0031.00042; Not paying the tax liabilities, can turn into a big deal for an incorporated business. There are many ways that tax officials and businessmen record their tax liabilities, the methods differ in terms of the procedure, but the end result is the same.; 0
0031.00043; However, businesses incorporated in the tax bracket should not consider the option of evading taxes as it can have severe consequences for the credibility and the operations of the company. The first step in the accounting procedure for recording tax liability is to be aware of what your tax liability amounts to.; 0
0031.00044; An entity can find its tax liability on line 22 of the new tax return form that went into effect with the 2018 tax year. Your total tax liability is not necessarily for just one tax year only.; 0
0031.00045; Anything that remains unpaid from previous years should be part of your total tax liability for the current year. Total tax liabilities depend on a number of factors.; 0
0031.00046; However, of all the factors that constitute your total tax liability, it is income tax that plays an integral part. A business must pay the income tax under the tax bracket it falls under.; 0
0031.00047; This varies to a great extent because the income tax depends on both the filing status and how much you earn. To keep up with rising inflation levels, the income parameters for each tax bracket tend to increase annually.; 0
0031.00048; The next part of the procedure is the collection of taxes. All businesses collect and set aside the correct amount of taxes. For example, withholding taxes from the wages of the employees by placing the withheld taxes in a separate bank account is one such collection method.; 0
0031.00049; Similarly, deductions are made from all other tax liabilities. However, these simple deductions are just the beginning of your tax liability the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) allows the federation to whittle away at your taxable income.; 0
0031.00050; Therefore, at the end of the day, your taxable liability is not based entirely on the total you earn in a given year.; 0
0031.00051; It is based on the difference between what you make and the standard deduction of your filing status or itemized deductions.; 0
0031.00052; Subtracting these figures gives you the final answer to your tax deductions. Once you are done assessing, analyzing, and deducting your tax liabilities, the next step is to track and record the expenses and incomes in your books.; 0
0031.00053; Although each step is significant when accounting for tax liabilities, practically mentioning them in your books and creating a record is the most important. All businesses need to understand the significance of recording tax liabilities.; 0
0031.00054; Staying up to date with the tax laws aids the owner in apprehending the tax net better.; 0
0031.00055; Following the tunes of rules and regulations is a must, and maintaining a record of the tax entries is a valid proof of you doing so.; 0
0031.00056; Key to recording the data is mentioning the due date for any entry. It is also essential to familiarize yourself with the business's tax depositing schedule and marking down due dates in a calendar.; 0
0031.00057; Mere awareness of tax liabilities is not sufficient for determining the accounting procedures to record them.; 0
0031.00058; As discussed above, there are different forms of tax liabilities, with each contributing to the overall tax deductions.; 0
0031.00059; The owners can divide the accounting procedure, just like the recording process of the tax liabilities.; 0

When you have got the figure of your total tax liabilities, you incorporate the balance as a liability in the current liabilities section. Upon completing the federal income tax returns, a business gets the idea of the actual amounts of tax owed.; 0

0032.00001; Brookings: Why Everyone Should Care About These Trustee Reports   Annual Trustees Reports provide estimates of the financial status of Social Security's Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) and Disability Insurance (DI) Trust Funds under current law.; 0
0032.00002; Recent Reports call for informed discussion, creative thinking, and timely legislation to address expected future deficits. Many policy makers have developed proposals and options to address this long-range solvency problem. Listed below is a broad range of policy options that would address Trust Fund solvency and other issues related to Social Security benefits and financing.; 0
0032.00003; Many of these options are part of comprehensive proposals intended to restore Trust Fund solvency.; 0

0033.00001; Watch Out for These Rev Rec Pain Points Private companies: The new revenue recognition standard is coming for you.; 0
0033.00002; Before the end of the year, private companies must implement the new 5-step approach to revenue recognition under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Although there has been plenty of advance notice about the new standard and its implementation deadlines, many private companies have not been proactive with their adoption efforts. As companies in technology , construction , manufacturing , and other industries move from the initial impact assessment through their adoption procedures, they will want to be on guard for some of the thornier elements in the revenue recognition standard.; 0
0033.00003; Being aware of some of the nuances, particularly around certain contract features, will help your company complete its adoption course in time and avoid the costly consequences for a late Topic 606 application.; 0
0033.00004; Contract Incentives Companies that offer incentives, including discounts, and loyalty programs to their customers will likely be deferring a portion of their revenues from those contracts until the customer cashes in on the discount or loyalty program benefit.; 0
0033.00005; From a technical perspective, most incentive arrangements constitute a material right under Topic 606, and the company reports the revenue from that right when the control transfers from the company to the customer, or when the incentive expires.; 0
0033.00006; Contract incentives take many forms, including: Future Discounts: If customers receive a price list for additional products after they make the first purchase and the items on the price list are discounted from the standalone selling price, the price list constitutes a separate material right.; 0
0033.00007; Companies would calculate the amount of revenue to be deferred as a result of that right by factoring in the estimated likelihood of a future purchase and the amount of the discount. Volume-Based Pricing: Tiered or volume discounts provide the customer with a material right if they must make an initial purchase at a higher price to earn a discount on any subsequent purchases.; 0
0033.00008; Free Services: Providing services at no additional charge - such as free consulting services in connection with a product purchase - usually provides the customer with a material right.; 0
0033.00009; The selling price for that right is based on the hours expected to be used and the standalone selling price of the free service. Loyalty Programs: Whether the loyalty program uses points, miles or other rewards, the program likely contains a material right.; 0
0033.00010; The selling price for that material right is based on the value of the incentive earned as well as the value of incentives accumulated over time. Warranties Not all warranties will have the same accounting treatment under the new revenue recognition standard.; 0
0033.00011; Those that provide a service beyond the base level of assurance associated with traditional product warranties are separate performance obligations, resulting in a deferral of revenue and recognition over the service period. Examples include: Manufacturer's Warranty: The estimated cost of fulfilling a one-year warranty obligation is accrued when control of the product is transferred and would not impact revenue.; 0
0033.00012; Five-Year Warranty with Annual Maintenance Services: Warranties that provide the customer with annual maintenance services, going beyond product assurance would be considered separate performance obligations.; 0
0033.00013; Long-Term Warranties: Covering a product for life provides a service beyond assurance and is considered a separate performance obligation. The estimate of the product life is used to calculate recognized revenue.; 0
0033.00014; Acceptance & Return Provisions Customers typically have a chance to accept or return a product for a period of time after they receive it.; 0
0033.00015; Future returns are estimated and recorded as a reduction of revenue, along with a corresponding refund liability.; 0
0033.00016; There are some provisions that may have different treatment: Percentage Payment Terms: When a final percentage of payment is due upon customer acceptance, it is considered a formality that does not impact transfer of control.; 0
0033.00017; No Right to Return: Even if a contract doesn't include explicit rights to return a product, the vendor's business practice may provide an implicit right.; 0
0033.00018; If this is the case, returns should be estimated and recorded as a reduction of the transaction price. Rebates & Price Provisions The contract price can change depending on rebates, price matching, and price protection provisions.; 0
0033.00019; These clauses are forms of variable consideration and should be estimated and recorded as an adjustment to the transaction price.; 0
0033.00020; For example, if a company agrees to issue a partial refund if a competitor lowers its price on a similar product or if the company sells the product to a different customer at a lower price, then it would recognize revenue when the control of the product transfers to the customer.; 0
0033.00021; It would estimate the potential refund and record it as a reduction in the transaction price. Customized Goods The new standard will permit over time recognition for customized goods in some instances, which is a change from the point-in-time recognition under previous guidance.; 0
0033.00022; Overtime recognition occurs when the asset being created has no alternative use and if the manufacturer has an enforceable right to payment for performance throughout the life of the contract.; 0
0033.00023; For example, if the manufacturer receives a payment for performance even if the customer cancels the contract (for reasons other than a breach of contract by the manufacturer).; 0
0033.00024; Nonrefundable Fees Fees related to the cost of fulfilling a contract, including nonrefundable set up, access, activation, initiation, joining, or membership fees, are typically not separate performance obligations, or may represent a material right, and are recognized when the control has transferred, or, if applicable, the material right is exercised or expires, even when they are paid for by the customer at the beginning of the contract.   Advance Payments Differences, typically greater than twelve months,between the customer's payment and the timing of the vendor's performance indicates the contract contains a significant financing component. This is accounted for separately from the contract revenue and will affect the total amount of revenue recognized.; 0
0033.00025; For example, Extended Payment Terms: A good indicator you have a significant financing component are customer payment terms longer than one year for a product delivered upfront.; 0
0033.00026; Reporting entities would have to determine which part of the revenue from their customer arrangement is attributing to financing and which part is related to the product because the portion attributed to financing is not considered revenue (rather it is interest income). Advance Payment for Services: Paying in advance for services performed over two years provides the vendor with funding for upfront costs and may contain a significant financing component.; 0
0033.00027; Price Increases Multi-year contract may include price increases to reflect changes in inflation or market rates for services.; 0
0033.00028; These price increases should be evaluated to determine whether they reflect separate performance obligations, otherwise they would be recognized as part of the transaction price.; 0
0033.00029; For example, if the contract language includes a fee schedule with a percentage increase for each year of the contract, but the contract includes only one performance obligation satisfied over time, then the vendor providing the service would have to determine the appropriate measure of recognizing revenue over time.; 0
0033.00030; A right to invoice practical expedient may apply.; 0
0033.00031; Contract Modifications Some contract modifications may affect more than one contract, or result in an existing contract to be terminated and new one issued instead. Accounting for contract modifications will depend on whether the modification adds a new performance obligation or distinct service and that service is being provided at its standalone selling price.; 0
0033.00032; Contract Amendments: If modifications add distinct goods or services priced at their standalone selling price, the modifications would be considered separate contracts from the original contract.; 0
0033.00033; Contracts for New Services: If a change to a contract adds a new service at a significantly discounted price, the change is generally viewed as a modification of the existing contract.; 0

EPRA has celebrated the 20th anniversary at the Association's annual conference, held this year in Madrid and attended by the most high profile figures in the industry.; 0
0034.00002; The occasion was marked with three of the original founding fathers present who reflected on the success of EPRA to continue the original objectives of the Association, such as establishing a solid and globally recognised index, improving transparency in the sector by aligning the various accounting and reporting methodologies and driving investment into the industry.; 0
0034.00003; 20 years later the sector has come a long way.; 0
0034.00004; The FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Index is a widely recognised benchmark with 334 constituents globally, representing a total market cap of EUR 1.66 tr compared to EUR 365 bn in 1999.; 0
0034.00005; European listed real estate outperforms European general equities with an average of 7.7% annualised returns (vs 4.6% for equities) and beating the European government bonds (4.6% annualised).; 1
0034.00006; One of the proudest achievements of the Association is the fact that there was only one REIT regime in Europe in 1999 while today 14 EU members have introduced the legislation, with a few more in the pipeline.; 0
0034.00007; The Association has been and will continue to be highly involved in EU legislation, as demonstrated by the recent success in lowering capital requirements under Solvency II from 39% to 22% for insurers investing in equities, including listed real estate.; 1
0034.00008; Dominique Moerenhout, CEO of EPRA, said: The figures really speak for themselves to demonstrate the success of the industry over the last 20 years.; 0
0034.00009; But while much has been already achieved, there is still room to grow for the European listed real estate sector and attract more generalist investors.; 0
0034.00010; Between the strong and stable dividend yield attracting institutional investors and large and accelerating investment flows into alternative property sectors, such as healthcare and self-storage, analysts are forecasting a doubling of the FTSE EPRA Nareit Developed Europe Index to around EUR 500 bn.; 1
0034.00011; Willem de Geus, founder of EPRA, formerly at Morgan Stanley, said: EPRA is the undisputed leader and champion for public real estate in Europe. Back when we set up the association, there was no central database with all the companies, transparency wasn't as high on the agenda, there wasn't a lot of research into listed real estate.; 0
0034.00012; And so we felt it would be good to have a representative body that would open up the sector to more investors because at the end of the day the goal is to have more capital attracted to the sector.; 0
0034.00013; It felt like a win-win. - ENDS -  About EPRA  The European Public Real Estate Association is the voice of the publicly traded European real estate sector.; 0
0034.00014; With more than 275 members, covering the whole spectrum of the listed real estate industry (companies, investors and their suppliers), EPRA represents over EUR 450 billion of real estate assetsand 94% of the market capitalisation of the FTSE EPRA Nareit Europe Index.

0036.00001; Local News  Mergers, innovation and consolidation are the mature, sensible way for media companies serving regional Australians to survive and thrive.; 0
0036.00002; That's the verdict of Australian Community Media co-owner Antony Catalano, who has declared the new ACM is open for business after sealing a deal to strengthen one of the regional publisher's 14 daily newspapers.; 0
0036.00003; Under an agreement announced in Bendigo on Friday, the owners of the Bendigo Weekly will merge their free weekly newspaper into ACM's paid daily, the Bendigo Advertiser.

0040.00001; SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Biocom, the association representing the life science industry of California, issued the following statement in response to a drug pricing proposal unveiled by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and sponsored by Energy & Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone  -  H.R.3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act  -  in the U.S. House of Representatives today. This statement may be attributed to Joe Panetta, president and CEO of Biocom:  On behalf of California's life sciences community, we are deeply concerned with Speaker Pelosi's newly released legislation, which proposes to import foreign price controls on medicines that treat patients here in the U.S. and impose extreme penalties on U.S. innovators, including an excise tax up to 95 percent of manufacturers' annual sales and severe civil monetary penalties.; 0
0040.00002; The U.S. produces two thirds of the world's medicines and gives hope to millions of patients around the world. Such a sweeping proposal sends the wrong message to innovators and investors who need a solid, fair and value-based market environment to research and develop the next-generation of breakthrough medicines.; 0
0040.00003; California, which is one of the world's leaders in biomedical innovation, would be among the first to suffer.; 0
0040.00004; We respectfully oppose H.R.3, but we remain available to work with the bill's sponsors on legislation that focuses on reducing patients' out-of-pocket costs, sharing negotiated savings with patients at the pharmacy counter and increasing cost transparency.; 0

0046.00003; US rates nudge lower  20th Sep 19, 7:57am  by Jason Wong  The USD has reversed course after its post-FOMC rally, and is now back to pre-FOMC levels. The NZD hasn't benefited from USD-weakness, falling in sympathy with the AUD after the Australian unemployment rate ticked higher. US rates are slightly lower for the day.; 0
0046.00004; The modest USD strength seen after the hawkish cut from the Fed yesterday has completely reversed, with USD indices down 0.2-0.3% for the day. US existing home sales were stronger than expected, continuing the streak of better than expected data coming from the housing market.; 0

0046.00014; The policy outlook is driven by how Brexit evolves, with a wide range of possible paths for the economy over the coming years. The minutes suggested that a policy response to a no-deal Brexit wouldn't be automatic, while a smooth departure would likely see a series of gradual and limited rate hikes over the next few years.; 0

0046.00017; A further lurch into negative territory for the BoJ policy rate is possible, but this could be self-defeating, with opposition from the trading banks, given the impact of negative rates on their profitability. The Bank will re-examine economic and price developments after the sales tax goes up on 1 October, but the BoJ's possible policy options are severely constrained. The AUD is at the bottom of the leaderboard, falling as low as 0.6780 yesterday, but regaining the 0.68 handle overnight.; 0

0046.00021; NZ Q2 GDP was at the stronger end of expectations, albeit matching RBNZ expectations at 0.5% q/q, and still taking annual growth down to a 5-year low of 2.1%.

The NZD made a few forays just below 0.63 but is holding up above that level this morning.; 0

0046.00026; The 2-year swap rate fell by 3bps to 0.97% while the 10-year rate fell by 7bps to 1.27%. The domestic focus turns to the RBNZ OCR review next week, with the Bank widely anticipated to keep policy steady after the shocking 50bps cut last month.

0047.00001; Published: September 21, 2019 10:50 am ET  No Comments | Jump to Comments  Standardbred Canada and the Ontario Sires Stakes partnered for the third consecutive year on the 'Win A Share in a Racehorse' contest. Ten contest finalists will be drawn to participate in an on-track showdown on October 5 during the OSS Grassroots Championship night at Woodbine Mohawk Park to determine the 'Win a Share' champion.; 0
0047.00002; One OSS Grassroots Championship race will be selected and the 10 finalists will each be paired with one of the starters.; 0
0047.00003; The finalist paired with the winning horse will win the Win A Share contest and the share in Landmark 13 Stable (valued at $2,000) just in time to go horse shopping at the 2019 edition of the London Selected Yearling Sale on October 19 and 20.; 1
0047.00004; In advance of announcing the contest finalists, SC spoke to one of the co-founders of LandMark Racing, Howard Pearce.; 0
0047.00005; As many harness racing participants know, the thrill of winning in this industry is second to none.; 0
0047.00006; But in order to experience that thrill, one must have a connection to the horse.; 0
0047.00007; Howard Pearce has brought this connection to new and rejuvenated harness racing fans alike through the fractional ownership venture, LandMark Racing, founded in 2006 with longtime friend and Standardbred trainer, Mark Steacy. While working full-time at Queen's University (in Kingston, Ontario) I began attending races at Kingston Park Raceway in 1982, reflects Pearce, it was soon after that when I ventured into ownership with Mark. In 2006, the Standardbred Breeders of Ontario Association (SBOA) offered a 'new ownership' program where both Howard and Mark were involved.; 0
0047.00008; At the completion of that initial program, LandMark was born. LandMark prides itself on being a unique opportunity to become an active Standardbred owner.; 0
0047.00009; It is economically friendly and administered easily for anyone to become involved.; 0
0047.00010; In the twelve years of operation there have been several hundred individuals involved with the twelve ownership groups, with group number thirteen currently forming. As Howard points out, LandMark groups never own 100 percent of a horse.; 1
0047.00011; Typically, the LandMark group gets in on four or five yearlings each year.; 0
0047.00012; Our main pitch is that by buying a share or shares with LandMark you will instantly own multiple horses and be able to watch multiple races, adding, we also make it very clear that our shareholders never get a bill - our model is very unique in that way. The number of shares each year is about 100, with some people buying one share and others purchasing multiple shares. This year we are hoping to attract between 120-150 buyers but we don't have an advertising budget so we have to rely on stories being shared on websites, in magazines and by word of mouth, says Pearce.; 0
0047.00013; We are lucky to have organizations like Standardbred Canada, the Ontario Sires Stakes, Ontario Racing, and Woodbine Mohawk Park to help with promoting our experience.; 0
0047.00014; LandMark racing is not just an opportunity Howard sells to other people, as he is also an active shareholder as well.; 0
0047.00015; Every year I buy at least two shares in each new group, he says. When it comes to LandMark's success, both on and off the track, Howard highlights three important elements that contribute: a winning horse, communication and an opportunity to see the horse. Having a winning horse does wonders for keeping everyone engaged and communication is essential.; 0
0047.00016; Members love my emails and our Facebook page.; 0
0047.00017; Our members also love to visit their horses. Many members visit Mark's barns in Lansdowne and at First Line (Training Center).; 0
0047.00018; Through the twelve years of fractional ownership with LandMark 8, one of the stable's most succesful horses was the trotting sensation Harper Blue Chip, a winner of almost $950,000. The ownership group of Harper Blue Chip had the chance to live every horseperson's dream.; 0
0047.00019; He was a starter for multiple high profiled stakes engagements including the Hambletonian where he finished an impressive third.; 0
0047.00020; His resume boasts wins in several Ontario Sires Stakes Gold events, the Ontario Sires Stakes Super Final, and the Canadian Breeders Final. To top it all off, Harper Blue Chip and his connections walked away with the O'Brien award for Three-Year-Old Trotting Colts/Geldings in 2014.; 0
0047.00021; The following LandMark had for Harper Blue Chip was our biggest ever. I wish we could get one like him every year.; 0
0047.00022; There has been no thrill like seeing him in the Hambo or when 56 people were in the winner's circle when he won the OSS Super Final, recalls Pearce.; 0
0047.00023; So, what does LandMark have in 2019?; 0
0047.00024; Landmark 10 is racing four-year-old pacing mare, Hello Love, who races in the top condition events at Woodbine Mohawk Park and has made over $50,000 to date.; 1
0047.00025; Landmark 11 raced In The Will, Love For Life and Parlay Seelster.; 0
0047.00026; LandMark 12 is racing the following two-year-olds: Bellini Seelster, Cute Accountant, Moana and Remember Titans. Obviously I am a little biased, but fractional ownership is a great way for someone to be introduced to the wonderful world of horse ownership, believes Pearce.; 0
0047.00027; Fractional ownership is the future for harness racing success.; 0
0048.00001; German fraud trial hears trader's journey from floor to jet-set WallStreetReview  BONN (Reuters)  -  A British banker told Germany's biggest fraud trial this week how he worked his way from office clerk to jet-setting trader before his dream career came to an early end.; 0
0048.00002; The name tags and bench of attorneys from various international banks are pictured at a regional court in Bonn where two British bankers are accused of involvement in bogus Cum-Ex tax reclaims of 440 million euros from the German state, in Bonn, Germany September 24, 2019. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay  Nicholas Diable, 38, is one of two British bankers who German prosecutors allege orchestrated a sham trading scheme to make illegitimate double tax reclaims of more than 450 million euros ($495 million).; 1
0048.00003; Diable, who has not denied he was involved in the 'cum-ex' trading but says he had no reason to believe it was illegal, played down his role during the court hearing in Bonn. He described his work as that of a salaried technician with a focus on getting trades done rather than a mastermind.; 0
0048.00004; For me, it was only a question of whether the trade was possible or not, Diable told the German judges on Wednesday.; 0
0048.00005; State prosecutor Anne Brorhilker this month outlined criminal charges against Diable and Martin Shields, who both face a possible jail term as well as a court order to repay money they earned from the trades if found guilty.; 0
0048.00006; Diable answered the accusation at his trial, the first criminal case brought against those involved in 'cum-ex' trading, a practice described by German finance minister Olaf Scholz as a scandal.; 0
0048.00007; Prosecutors allege that players in the scheme misled the state into thinking a stock had multiple owners who were each owed a dividend and a tax credit. Germany estimates such trades cost it more than 5 billion euros in total.; 1
0048.00008; If successful, this case would make it easier to pursue others and recover the money lost.; 0
0048.00009; Brorhilker said the two men had targeted companies including carmaker BMW and airline Lufthansa, outlining more than 30 instances of double-tax reclaims totaling 447 million euros.; 1
0048.00010; Shields told the court last week that he regretted his involvement in the industrial scale trading scheme, but that the practice was common knowledge and that he had no reason to believe at the time that it was legally questionable.[L5N2693EB]  The 41-year-old Oxford university graduate said the trading thrived between 2005 and 2012, as investors from around the globe made multi-billion-euro trades on German companies.; 0
0048.00011; Diable emphasized his more technical, junior role, telling judges about his modest start in the City of London, inputting data, taking lunch orders and rituals such as running through an office as colleagues threw objects at him.; 0
0048.00012; He later became a trader and worked with Shields at German bank HVB, carrying out such trades, before following him to Gibraltar, when Shields set up his own company. Both jobs involved entertaining customers and contacts in bars and restaurants in London, at Germany's Oktoberfest beer festival, as well as in Gibraltar, Diable said.; 0
0048.00013; Diable said he had been under investigation since he was 31 during a statement made to the court over two days outlining the mechanics of the trading. The alleged scheme involved trading shares rapidly around a syndicate of banks, investors and hedge funds to give the impression of numerous owners, each entitled to a tax rebate.; 0
0048.00014; The case, Germany's biggest post-war fraud investigation, is being closely followed in London and Frankfurt, where much of the trading was organized, according to bankers and court documents. HVB, which has blamed its involvement on wrongdoing by individuals, has declined further comment. Reporting by John O'Donnell Editing by Alexander Smith  No related posts.; 0

In Roscommon, funding from the increase in the tax is to be ringfenced for services such as hedge cutting and footpaths as well as providing funding for village renewal schemes, and to meet increases costs in providing public services.; 0

The website added that the claim was by far the largest tax case in the Netherlands against a multinational company to date and that similar discussions are currently underway with several multinationals about amounts of more than €100m.; 0

0055.00001; -  Wednesday 18th September 2019  - Text too small? New directors at Evolve Education were forced to their feet as shareholders demanded information from the childcare firm's new management.; 0
0055.00002; But there was little forthcoming at today's annual meeting from the new executives of the beleaguered NZX-listed childcare company, which recently traded at 11.2 cents a share after listing at $1 in 2014. In May, Evolve reported underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $13.3 million in the year ended March 31, down from $21.6 million in the prior year, a 38 percent plunge. Today, departing chair Norah Barlow gave a brief presentation during which she labelled the latest results - despite a turnaround plan - disappointing.; 0
0055.00003; When it became evident no presentation had been prepared by the new management, shareholder Jenny Miller dubbed the event a pseudo-ASM.; 0
0055.00004; I am shocked - we were expecting some direction on where we were going, she said.; 0
0055.00005; Barlow explained that shareholders must wait until new management had completed a review of the New Zealand business, which would be presented at the end of November.; 0
0055.00006; I know it is not quite right for now, but in some ways this is more appropriate for the new team, Barlow added.; 0

0055.00011; But in a move raising eyebrows, his appointment starts tomorrow, meaning his appointment won't be voted on until the next annual meeting.; 0
0055.00012; When it came time to elect Scott, the Australian was urged to explain who he was by shareholders, one of whom complained about having only seen the back of his head.; 0
0055.00013; Scott got to his feet and told shareholders he was a businessman and a father of six. He told the audience he would make Evolve work, adding that he had a lot of skin in the game, referencing the 33 percent stake he owns in the company.; 0

0055.00018; You have to look after your people because the rent you are stuck with. And the government you can't do anything about.; 0

0056.00002; Excerpts:  Your bank is celebrating its 10 anniversary. Can you to tell us about the journey so far?; 0
0056.00003; The journey started 2009, when we got our license. But we opened our first branch in March, 2010 and we made our first disbursement in 2010 in Kaduna.; 0
0056.00004; Like most institutions, we started from a very humble background in one shop in Kaduna from there we grew to about six branches in Kaduna till 2015 and in 2016, we got the national license that brought us to Lagos and Abuja. So, today, we have about 20 branches in our network and we are still expanding.; 0
0056.00005; The journey has not been easy, but with the help of God and good strategy, we have seen ourselves where we are today.; 0
0056.00006; There is no doubt that we are one of the leading institutions in this sub-sector in Nigeria by whatever parameters you want to measure.; 0
0056.00007; Whether it is by the number of customers, the asset base, number of branches, financial performance in terms of profitability, the earnings, the staff size, we are number one.; 0
0056.00008; So we have come a long way in10 years and we are starting another slate and trying to build on what we have done.; 0
0056.00009; One is happy to say that we have seen growth consistently in the last four or five years.; 0
0056.00010; Every year has been better than the previous year and we hope that this can continue for a long time to come.; 0
0056.00011; You operate in a very tough environment.; 0
0056.00012; Can you tell us some of the challenges faced in the last 10 years? We faced a lot of challenges.; 0
0056.00013; Firstly, for the first five years, I was not in this institution, but I read through all that happened and I know that there was a challenge trying to establish in Kaduna with limited infrastructure.; 0
0056.00014; Of course, with the customer base, per capita income and population and everything, among the national microfinance bank, we were the only person that started from Kaduna. There was no other one that started from Kaduna. Only one started from Abuja which does no longer exist.; 0
0056.00015; The issue of insecurity that came up, the Boko harm crisis which we have been battling with, of course that made it impossible for you to get the best hands to even work in a place like Kaduna because nobody wants to go that area, so we had to make do with what we have and train the people and see what we can get. Then you also talk of the fact that the market is limited.; 0
0056.00016; We started in a place where it was difficult to expand.; 0
0056.00017; So, we had just six branches in five years. It was not that easy to grow, so if you want to talk about staff, there were not there. Customers, branch network and financial resources were limited.; 0
0056.00018; The type of banks that were coming to give us some form of on lending fund in Lagos were not ready to do that in Kaduna because they simply cannot see you.; 0
0056.00019; Then the issue of deploying the products that we have, because of the limited demand in Kaduna, we couldn't do so many things. So all these summed together explained to you that it was very challenging.; 0
0056.00020; But also a very good place to start, when you start with a very challenging environment, and you move to some other environment, the challenges are different.; 0
0056.00021; What we see in Lagos is different from that of Kaduna. In Lagos the market is there, but you have people that are very high and financially literate, so it is difficult for you to bring any garbage and people will buy it. Then you have a lot of competitors in Lagos and a lot of people who willingly default in Lagos.; 0
0056.00022; So these are two different markets with different kinds of challenges. One place, the business is not really there, but the customers are what you want them to be.; 0
0056.00023; The other one business is there, market is large, but there are a lot of competitors and customers are so literate, some of them are out to do fraud from day one and default is very high.; 0
0056.00024; Of course in Lagos it was easy to find funds unlike in Kaduna where to grow the deposit was really challenging.; 0
0056.00025; I can tell you that since we came to Lagos, our deposit has jumped by more than 10 times in like three years.; 0
0056.00026; So there are different opportunities and challenges coming.; 0
0056.00027; How were you able to overcome these challenges?; 0
0056.00028; Let's start with the people that matter most which is the staff (getting the right hands).; 0
0056.00029; We have very dedicated and loyal staff.; 0
0056.00030; I think as an organisation what we have done is to be able to train them.; 0
0056.00031; We have trained people to think in the way we want them to run the company and a lot of them follow this and that has helped us. So training, good manpower, loyal dedicated staff, and the other factor is to emphasis your strength.; 0
0056.00032; There are areas if you look at the microfinance bank maybe we will not be counted.; 0
0056.00033; There are areas too that we are doing very well, better than most microfinance banks.; 0
0056.00034; So we emphasis our area of strength and try to build on it while we try to correct areas where we have deficiencies. For instance, our loan book is one of the best in the country.; 0
0056.00035; In terms of the risk, while some people are saying it is impossible to get their repayment, I can tell you that in the last four years, we have never had a portfolio at risk, people that are supposed to pay back your loans and didn't back at the particular time, for instance 30days has consistently been less than 3 percent.; 0
0056.00036; While some people are telling you theirs is between 15-20 per cent ours has been different. So part of this is what helped us and then our customer selection too, it is not all comers. It is also very important to say that it takes on the average four days to process our loan, but it is subjected to maximum scrutiny.; 0
0056.00037; So if you pass through our system, I can to a very large extent say that you're very good customer. We meet our words to the customers in terms of commitment, timing, prompt delivery of services, also we tell the customer that they are pay as it when due.; 0
0056.00038; In terms of efficiency and strictness with repayment, we are high up there.; 0
0056.00039; So if you're not a good customer, we don't need to tell you, you will not even come to us, you will find your way and go elsewhere, of course there are so many microfinance banks in Nigeria.; 0
0056.00040; However, for the good ones, who want to do business and wants efficiency and good services they will always come to us. I think the other thing that is very important to mention is the support we enjoy from our shareholders and from the group.; 0
0056.00041; We have shareholders such as the International Finance Cooperation (IFC), PROPACO, Boabab, which used to be Microcred.; 0
0056.00042; All have been very supportive by given support in finding funds, market studies, product development, and so many other things, they have been very open to supporting us. So those kinds of shareholders you are also very happy to push forward.; 0
0056.00043; Then we have a board that is very dynamic and made up of serious minded people and they have been very supportive too.; 0
0056.00044; I think a combination of all these and of course every product that we bring out is tailored towards the market. So there is a market study, you do your investigation and you come up with what the customer will prefer and so we hardly have a situation where you launch a product that fails because we will do all the rigorous work that is needed to be done.; 0
0056.00045; Let me say and one of the things which is most important is the good management.; 0
0056.00046; The kind management we have here is the experience, dedicated and loyal people who are forward thinking. A lot of people tell us we have achieved so much, but for us we have not even started.; 0
0056.00047; So based on the management team that I see, I'm not in doubt that this company will not grow by leaps and bounds in the coming years, and I can tell you that it is just a matter of time we will overtake a lot of the commercial banks. Can you talk to us about some of your products? First of all, there is a broad division of the product into four.; 0
0056.00048; One is the savings and deposit product, loans and advances product, transactional product, and insurance products. For the savings, we have the regular savings, which is generic-current, fixed deposit and savings.; 0
0056.00049; Beyond that we have target savings, for instance, Ajo, which is targeted at you getting maximum interest sometimes up 100 percent of the deposit that you make.; 1
0056.00050; Then you have savings for schools and others and they have been doing very well because they are targeted at specific kinds of people who will need to those services and they have been using it very well. Then for loans and advances, our minimum loan today is N20,000 and our maximum is N50 million.; 0
0056.00051; So you discover that both micro, micro plus and SME clients can find their space in our company. So if you are a N20,000 customer, we will give you that service. If you are a N50 million customer, we will give you that service.; 1
0056.00052; Now we are trying to extent this to N100 million which will happen before the end of this year, so if you want N100 million, you will be able to get a buy back, if you want 20,000, you will be able to get a buy back.; 1
0056.00053; Again, we have try to automate some of these loans, we have the one that is called Taka, which is fully automated and you get at the click of a button.; 0
0056.00054; Then we have Alip, which is a scoring system that is based on your performance of your previous loan, a customer gets automatic renewal and a 20 percent increase immediately, so if you enjoy like N1 million loan, and you pay back very well, you will get N1.2 million.; 1
0056.00055; You don't need to talk to everybody, no new documentation is required, you just sign the offer and it is something that can happen within five minutes. Of course we have housing loan to address to housing.; 0
0056.00056; Presently, our housing loan disbursement is close to about N700 million.; 0
0056.00057; We just started recently, but it is growing really fast.; 0
0056.00058; Let me say for Baobab, we will give you loan if there is a proof of cash flow that are repaid the principal and interest. Of course we have 21 exclusion list, which we don't touch at all such as deforestation, brothel, sex work, and anything that is harmful to human being. We have 21 of them, we don't touch those ones.; 0
0056.00059; Outside of that these 21, any business that you ran that we can see that there is cash flow to pay the principal and pay the interest, you are on-board, then we have transaction such as transfers, and making payments, then we have insurance, today we have both health and business insurance. There is no customer with a loan in the bank without insurance.; 0
0056.00060; These premium are negotiated to the minimum possible level you can think of. So if you run into any difficult such as fire, burglary, theft and accident, there is insurance to cover all those things, so you will hear that a customer of the bank died and we go after the family, we don't do that because the individual is covered by insurance.; 0
0056.00061; We will go to the insurance and the insurance company will pay. It is just to make life easy for our customers, so these products we have put together, which is not common in most of the microfinance banks, just to appeal of our customers.; 0
0056.00062; Like I tell you, all of them are doing very well. What happens to Baobab bank if you are not there tomorrow as the chief executive?; 0
0056.00063; What is the succession plan? We have a good succession plan.; 0
0056.00064; By regulation too, if I do well the company can keep me for 10 years, now I'm crossing the fifth year and I still have a long-time.; 0
0056.00065; But beyond that too, we have a good succession plan. As CEO, I believe my success is the success of my subordinate.; 0
0056.00066; I'm not hiding anything from anybody I try as much as possible to impact my staff with knowledge, ideas and everything, I am doing. So if you are really ready to learn, there is a lot to learn.; 0
0056.00067; For me, I also believe that your wealth is how you are able to impact people. I particularly like staff that are ready to learn and of course when you're coming in, you will see that we have a library.; 0
0056.00068; I think this is the only branch of a company where you have a library I take studies and knowledge very serious.; 0
0056.00069; From next month we will have a session which is going to be called a brain trust, where people will come and make a presentation. I will be the one to start it.; 0
0056.00070; Weekly, somebody will come and make presentation, where I can make my contribution.; 0
0056.00071; Anyone who is ready to learn, there is enough opportunity for the person to learn and be able to carry on. We have very strong management team who are specialists in their areas, and so if today I decide to take a leave maybe two or three weeks, the company will not suffer in anyway. We have a very strong management that will have built over time and we will together for a while to come.; 0
0056.00072; Let's talk about recapitalisation, the last time we spoke, you told me you will be ready by September or October.; 0
0056.00073; Where are you now?; 0
0056.00074; Well, the plan is still on.; 0
0056.00075; You know the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) also changed the date.; 0
0056.00076; Before the end of this year, we will be able to meet the recapitalisation plan. The board has directed that we should conclude this before the end of September, I think that will be shifted and I can tell that it will happen before the end of the year.; 0
0056.00077; Also, if you go by the profits we have made, we are well over N3 billion now.; 0
0056.00078; From the computation that we have made, maybe what we will need will be N1.2 billion. Given the kind of shareholders that we have such, as the IFC and others, these are international investors.; 0
0056.00079; When you look at the group level, you have Axa International, European Investment Bank, and IFC it is a very small amount for one to cover, so I don't think it is one of the things that disturb my head. I see it like a done deal. Commercial banks seem to be focusing on the real sector now, because there is a rule by the CBN for them to increase lending to the real sector.; 0
0056.00080; How does this affect your market going forward? The directive by the CBN to commercial banks is for them to increase their lending to at 60 per cent of their deposit is a step in the right direction.; 0
0056.00081; First of all, let me say this is what microfinance banks have been doing. For instance, my deposit today is about N4 billion and my loan book is about N10 billion.; 0
0056.00082; So my loan book is higher than my deposit.; 0
0056.00083; The reversal is what you see in the commercial banks, this is the scenario and that is why I think the CBN is saying that if the money is good enough for you as deposit, then they should be good enough for you to extend your lending to which I think is a very good and smart thing to do.; 0
0056.00084; But let me say that as to the effect of Boabab, it is two ways: one is the competitive landscape we have SME customers who are now the target of the commercial banks.; 0
0056.00085; Some of them even offer loans as little as N100, 000, which is not happening before now.; 0
0056.00086; It is a big competition for everybody, I see it as something very good and it is going to be bring about innovation, and customers getting the best. You can longer sit back and dish out whatever thing that you like.; 0
0056.00087; You have to be careful what you take to the market.; 0
0056.00088; So customer is the eventual beneficiary, so competition is there by this directive.; 0
0056.00089; But let me tell you another beautiful thing that is also happening, interest rate is coming down from the market.; 0
0056.00090; Because of competition, banks are trying to offer the best rate possible. This is going to stimulate the economy and production is expected to be higher and generally if you grow the economy, it is for everyone good in the long run. Short run, there will be competition maybe you grow some of your clients.; 0
0056.00091; At this point I want to look at point I want to be patriotic, grow the economy, and make it very robust and the best it can be and let other people partake in the economy and probably, we can erode things such as insecurity, kidnapping and other things.; 0
0056.00092; Generally, it is a very good thing.; 0
0056.00093; The other leg of it is that because this directive has gone out, banks are also scrambling to get customers like us, so their lending to microfinance banks has to go up, because they need to meet this requirement and then the rate has to come down. So, yes on one side is negative, competition and prices are dropping in the market.; 0
0056.00094; The other side is that you can grow the economy and lending to the subsector, the microfinance banks, will become higher for us to on-lend. This has been my experience, I have seen banks approach me now, with very ridiculous rate that they will not have done about a year ago, I cannot even think about it.; 0
0056.00095; If you like, it has its positive and negative on my business. But overall, I think the positive are more than the negative and everyone can find his/her space within the economy, which we are trying to do at Boabab.; 0
0056.00096; As things come, you also been able to develop strategy to overcome those things because they will continue to come, it is a market and it is dynamic and will continue to change. We saw this coming probably will prepare ourselves to overcome whatever difficult that we have.; 0
0056.00097; In terms of affecting my financials, no, in fact, it has helped us and I can get new lines from the bank which is better than before, even though my customers are asking for lower rates, over all I think it is good for everybody. When will Baobab be listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE)?; 0
0056.00098; We have been in discussion with the NSE for three main reasons: First, is to raise a bond, commercial paper bond and listing.; 0
0056.00099; Baobab will be listed.; 0
0056.00100; Of course, will achieve full recapitalisation and add more to the expansion we are doing, and then we will come to the market.; 0
0056.00101; I know our brand is already an attractive company for anybody who wants to invest.; 0
0056.00102; We will make it more attractive and our return will justify our coming to the market. I don't have any doubt that the day we will come it is going to be oversubscribed. It is going to be very soon, I can assure you that before the end of 2022 we will be in the market.; 0
0056.00103; What should we expect from your bank in the next 10 years?; 0
0056.00104; In the next few months to come, what you see about Boabab is a digitalised bank.; 0
0056.00105; So you will be able to do most things that you do in the bank in the comfort of your home with your tablet or with your phone.; 0
0056.00106; The second thing is that we are likely to see the rapid growth because what we have been doing by way of strategy is to open two to four branches every year. Now we have the workforce that can propel us to open more branches without suffering any hitch at all.; 0
0056.00107; You will see more branches open we will go to different locations in the country.; 0
0056.00108; Apart from the fact that we are using digital tools, physical presence is there, we are also looking at agency banking.; 0
0056.00109; We are going to spread across the country, using our agent network to reach our customers. We have also said that we are coming out to provide opportunities for people who want to invest in Boabab in no distance time. But above all we are going to make our customer the best in terms of the returns they get from their business, the confidence they get from their bankers, and the services that they get.; 0
0056.00110; Our customers will be the best. We are not going to be the best bank our customers will be the best that you will have around, so that both of us will grow together.; 0

0059.00001; Brief  Seattle mayor proposes minimum wage, protections for ride-hailing drivers Jay Huang / Flickr  By  Chris Teale  Sept. 20, 2019  Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan Fare Share legislation, mandating ride-hailing drivers be paid a minimum wage and be compensated for benefits and expenses, starting July 1, 2020. The city would commission a study to determine the level of that wage and any other benefits.; 0
0059.00002; Durkan also proposed establishing the country's first Driver Resolution Center, which would give Uber and Lyft drivers independent representation in settling unwarranted deactivation that would prevent them from driving for the companies. Under the Fare Share plan, fares would be increased 51 cents per ride. This money would allow city officials in five years to invest more than $52 million in housing near transit, $56 million to fully fund streetcar service, and $17.75 million to create the Driver Resolution Center.; 1
0059.00003; This is not the first time that a city has looked to more closely regulate the ride-hailing industry to offer additional protections to drivers.; 0
0059.00004; New York City became the first in the nation last year to approve regulations on ride-hailing, including a minimum wage for drivers, a cap on new licenses, and a study on ride-hailing's impact on the city's taxi industry and street congestion.; 0
0059.00005; These rules brought howls of opposition from both Uber and Lyft officials, who said that the cap would limit transportation options. Chicago has also explored similar regulations in the recent past. In an email to Smart Cities Dive, Uber regional spokesperson Nathan Hambley said the company wants to compromise with Durkan on the proposed regulations, noting the fare increase is unfair.; 0
0059.00006; The companies already pay a 24-cent fee per ride to fund wheelchair-accessible taxis and regulation of the industry, and Uber officials said they would prefer that issues around driver earnings, benefits and protections be resolved at the state level.; 1
0059.00007; The Mayor's decision to triple Seattle's tax on ridesharing will raise prices for riders and decrease trips for drivers, Hambley told Smart Cities Dive.; 0
0059.00008; We support the creation of a guaranteed minimum earnings standard for drivers, and have engaged in good faith with the Mayor's office and labor leaders for several months on this issue in hopes of reaching a compromise. We believe that any rideshare proposals should be developed based on broad input from the entire rideshare driver community in Seattle.; 0
0059.00009; Lyft officials were also critical of Durkan's proposal.; 0
0059.00010; Lyft spokeswoman Lauren Alexander told Smart Cities Dive in an email that the company had agreed to a minimum earnings floor with the city, but Durkan rejected that plan.; 0
0059.00011; While Lyft fully supports a minimum earnings guarantee for drivers, the Mayor's regressive tax proposal for riders will hurt the underserved communities that rely on affordable rideshare most, Alexander said.; 0
0059.00012; Fifty-one percent of Seattle Lyft rides start or end in low-income areas, and the Mayor's regressive tax would increase the fees they already pay by 300 percent, making it the most taxed rideshare city in the country. Drivers will also lose, as their earnings decrease with fewer overall rides.; 0
0059.00013; Instead, the Mayor should utilize the surplus the City already has under the current fee structure and combine it with a more equitable and effective approach, comprehensive congestion pricing, in order to fund her larger transportation and affordable housing goals. The Driver Resolution Center is a particularly intriguing proposition and comes on the heels of California passing state-level legislation, primarily aimed at Uber and Lyft, that extended wage and benefit protections to workers in the gig economy.; 0
0059.00014; California Gov.; 0
0059.00015; Gavin Newsom said in a statement that in addition to those protections, there must be pathways for more workers to unionize and have a stronger voice at work.; 0
0059.00016; Seattle's proposed independent center could be a way to do that, with city officials saying it will include culturally responsive outreach and education services on driver rights as well as an arbitration and appeals process.; 0
0059.00017; The legislation is subject to debate and approval by the Seattle City Council.; 0
0059.00018; In a statement accompanying Durkan's announcement, City Council President Bruce Harrell said elected officials will work closely to examine the Mayor's proposal in a transparent manner and will provide an opportunity for the public to weigh in over the next few months.

0061.00002; Suppose a buy-and-hold investor was considering an investment into Intuit Inc (NASD: INTU) back in 1999: back then, such an investor may have been pondering this very same question.; 0
0061.00003; Had they answered yes to a full twenty year investment time horizon and then actually held for these past 20 years, here's how that investment would have turned out. - INTU 20-Year Return Details  - Start date: - 09/23/1999 -  - $10,000  09/23/1999 - - $174,661  09/20/2019  - End date: - 09/20/2019  - Start price/share: - $16.76  - End price/share: - $269.18  - Starting shares: - 596.66  - Ending shares: - 648.75  - Dividends reinvested/share: - $9.04  - Total return: - 1,646.29%  - Average annual return: - 15.37%  - Starting investment: - $10,000.00  - Ending investment: - $174,661.86  The above analysis shows the twenty year investment result worked out exceptionally well, with an annualized rate of return of 15.37%. This would have turned a $10K investment made 20 years ago into $174,661.86 today (as of 09/20/2019).; 1
0061.00004; On a total return basis, that's a result of 1,646.29% (something to think about: how might INTU shares perform over the next 20 years?). [These numbers were computed with the Dividend Channel DRIP Returns Calculator.]; 0
0061.00005; Dividends are always an important investment factor to consider, and Intuit Inc has paid $9.04/share in dividends to shareholders over the past 20 years we looked at above. Many an investor will only invest in stocks that pay dividends, so this component of total return is always an important consideration.; 0
0061.00006; Automated reinvestment of dividends into additional shares of stock can be a great way for an investor to compound their returns. The above calculations are done with the assuption that dividends received over time are reinvested (the calcuations use the closing price on ex-date).; 0
0061.00007; Based upon the most recent annualized dividend rate of 2.12/share, we calculate that INTU has a current yield of approximately 0.79%.; 1
0061.00008; Another interesting datapoint we can examine is 'yield on cost'  -  in other words, we can express the current annualized dividend of 2.12 against the original $16.76/share purchase price. This works out to a yield on cost of 4.71%.; 1

0064.00001; Portfolio Strategy  by: William Matson, CFA  William Matson, CFA  Deep Value, micro-cap, nano-cap, small-cap  Summary  Using market cap in calculating Price/Earnings and Price/Sales ratios can lead to misleading results.; 0
0064.00002; Substituting enterprise value for market cap in these ratios is necessary when evaluating companies with large cash balances. Investors being misled by their P/E and P/S ratios create exploitable opportunities for those with better information.; 0
0064.00003; Price/Earnings (P/E) and Price/Sales (P/S) ratios using market cap in the numerator have long been important go-to tools for screening stocks.; 0
0064.00004; Generally, they work quite well.; 0
0064.00005; But in situations involving firms with significant year-round cash balances, substituting enterprise value for market cap can be invaluable in spotting undervalued stocks.; 0
0064.00006; Many publicly traded U.S. companies hold much more cash than they need to operate their businesses. This can result in their P/E and P/S ratios being quite a bit higher than they might otherwise be. In other words, possessing a large amount of cash can actually cause a company to appear overvalued!; 0
0064.00007; Consider the following example, which uses market cap in calculating P/E and P/S ratios. Company A's cash balance is $1 million and Company B's is $2 million.; 0
0064.00008; Each has sales of $2 million and earnings of $125,000.; 0
0064.00009; Except for B's shareholders' equity, which is $1 million greater than A's, their financial statements are identical, as are their projected sales and earnings. A's market cap, however, is $2 million, while B's is $2.75 million.; 0
0064.00010; Suppose you are a value stock investor and the first step in your screening process is to eliminate stocks with P/Es over 20x and P/Ss over 1.25x.; 0
0064.00011; Company A - with a 16x P/E and 1.0x P/S - passes both of these tests, but Company B - with a 22x P/E and P/S of 1.4x - fails them both. Consequently, you eliminate B from consideration.; 0
0064.00012; But wait!; 0
0064.00013; Because A's and B's underlying businesses and their prospects are identical, it also appears that the market is only ascribing $750,000 in value to the $1 million excess of B's cash balance versus A's.; 1
0064.00014; Viewed in this way, B is obviously the superior investment candidate, despite its seemingly inferior valuation metrics.; 0
0064.00015; Had you used enterprise value rather than market cap in calculating your valuation ratios, you would have recognized this.; 0
0064.00016; Enterprise value (EV) defined A company's EV is the theoretical takeover price of its operations.; 0
0064.00017; EV is the sum of:  - its market cap,  - the value of its preferred shares, and  - the value of debtholder claims  Minus  - its cash.; 0
0064.00018; Cash is backed out of the calculation because if you were to buy 100% of a company, you would own its cash. Thus, it makes sense to subtract it when calculating your net cash outlay for the purchase.; 0
0064.00019; It is unlikely that paying its EV would be enough to buy 100% of your target. Most acquisitions of publicly traded companies require a premium to whatever the market cap is at the time of the buyout offer.; 0
0064.00020; In addition, the target's senior managers may be contractually entitled to receive significant sums when there is a change of control.; 0
0064.00021; That is why the EV is a theoretical takeover price figure. Most investors, however, aren't looking to take over the companies in which they invest.; 0
0064.00022; So, if you are like most investors, these potential complications have little relevance to your situation.; 0
0064.00023; Returning to our example, let's recalculate A's and B's P/E and P/S ratios using EV rather than market cap.; 0
0064.00024; We'll also assume that neither company has any preferred stock or debt.; 0
0064.00025; A's EV is $1 million: $2 million market cap less $1 million cash. B's EV is $750,000: $2.75 million market cap less $2 million cash.; 0
0064.00026; A's P/E is 8x: $1 million EV/$125,000 earnings.; 0
0064.00027; B's P/E is 6x: $750,000 EV/$125,000 earnings.; 0
0064.00028; A's P/S is .50x: $1 million EV/$2 million sales.; 0
0064.00029; B's P/S is .38x: $750,000 EV/$2 million sales. B's P/E and P/S metrics are clearly superior to A's when EV is substituted for market cap.; 0
0064.00030; Relatively few investors know what EV is, let alone use it EV has been largely ignored for many years, even by investment professionals. While co-authoring Data Driven Investing (DDI), I reviewed five decades of Financial Analyst Journal articles regarding the factors correlating with superior returns, but they contained little, if any, mention of EV.; 0
0064.00031; Moreover, the two primary sources of inspiration for my own research and investing - James O'Shaughnessy and Robert Haugen - were virtually silent about EVs as of 2004, when DDI was published.; 0
0064.00032; It wasn't until 2011 that O'Shaughnessy unveiled the superior results achieved from 1964 to 2009 by stocks with low ratios of EV/EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization). Scant media attention has been accorded to EV since then, in part because EV is a more complex concept than market cap, but also because stocks with low ratios of EV to earnings and sales (value stocks, generally) tend to underperform in booming stock markets such as those that have prevailed for the past decade.; 0
0064.00033; The performance of my personal portfolio has reflected this, as I have maintained a value focus throughout the past 19 years. While the S&P 500 was declining from 1320.28 to 903.25 between 2001 and 2008, my portfolio outperformed its 19-year compounded annual growth rate of 20.9% five times in those eight calendar years (i.e., 62.5% of the time).; 0
0064.00034; And while that index rose from 903.25 to 2506.85 between 2009 and 2018, the portfolio returned more than 20.9% just four times in ten calendar years (i.e., 40% of the time).; 0
0064.00035; It was profitable 15 years out of 18 - seven of the eight bear market years (2001-2008), versus eight of the ten bull market years (2009-2018).; 0
0064.00036; (Note that past performance does not guarantee future performance.); 0
0064.00037; Companies with exceptionally attractive (i.e., very low) ratios of EV to earnings and sales are more likely than most:  to have strong balance sheets with large cash balances and little or no debt, to have lower-than-average stock price volatility, to not require additional financing through follow-on offerings of their common stock (which might otherwise precipitate large dips in their stock prices), and to attract takeover bids at significant premiums to their current prices. It also stands to reason that if other investors are basing their decisions on misleading valuation ratios, this ought to create exploitable opportunities for those who rely on better information.; 0

0065.00001; By Amy Fontinelle  Amy Fontinelle is a personal finance writer focusing on budgeting, credit cards, mortgages, real estate, investing, and other topics. Posted on Aug 13, 2019  You know that your child's college education is likely to cost a lot more than yours did if current trends continue.; 0
0065.00002; The bill for entering college in 2033 and attending a public university for four years could be, by one estimate , as much as $134,000 for tuition, room, and board.1  That's why planning for this cost as far in advance as possible can be so important. There are a range of ways to save, but 529 college savings plans tend to be the most popular. There are two types of 529 college savings plans that can help: 529 savings plans and 529 prepaid tuition plans.; 0
0065.00003; Learn about the pros and cons of each option below.; 0
0065.00004; But first use our college savings calculator to see how much you might need to squirrel away. 529 savings plans  What to know: State-run 529 savings plans are designed to help make higher education more affordable. They offer a state income tax break on contributions in more than 30 states.; 0
0065.00005; They also offer federal and state tax breaks on account growth.; 0
0065.00006; What they don't offer is a federal tax break on contributions.; 0
0065.00007; They do come with another big tax break: Withdrawals used for qualified educational expenses, such as tuition, fees, books, and supplies, are often not taxed, especially at the federal level.; 0
0065.00008; IRS Publication 970 explains the rules in more detail.; 0
0065.00009; These accounts are popular for good reason. Along with their tax benefits, 529 plans typically have a limited impact on a student's college financial aid.; 0
0065.00010; Only about 5 percent of 529 plan assets, whether they're held in the child's name or the parent's name, will be counted toward the family's expected contribution to college costs. Lifetime contribution limits to 529 plans are $235,000 to $529,000 per beneficiary, depending on the plan and the state, said Mark Kantrowitz, a nationally recognized expert on student financial aid, scholarships, and student loans. Most states have at least one plan, and because of the differences among plans, you might find that the most beneficial choice for your situation is not administered by your home state.; 0
0065.00011; Options and control: Another benefit of 529 savings plans is that they allow parents to control the money if the child doesn't attend college. Funds can be held until a later date in case the original beneficiary has a change of heart.; 0
0065.00012; They can also be transferred to a different beneficiary, such as a sibling, grandchild, or even a parent.; 0
0065.00013; 529 assets can even be used to pay for K - 12 tuition. Funds not spent on undergraduate education can also be transferred to a sibling or saved for graduate school.; 0
0065.00014; Learn more: Alternatives for 529 college savings  While starting early provides more opportunity for contributions to grow through investing, it's rarely too late to start.; 0
0065.00015; Parents who have savings in a different account and want to enjoy the tax and financial aid advantages of a 529 plan may front load the plan with annual exclusion gifts.; 0
0065.00016; The annual gift tax exclusion  -  the amount of money that one person may transfer to another as a gift without incurring a gift tax  -  amount is $15,000 per donor per beneficiary in 2019.; 0
0065.00017; But with a 529 plan, individuals may contribute up to $75,000 ($150,000 for couples) per beneficiary if the contribution is treated as if it were spread over a five-year period.; 1
0065.00018; To avoid gift tax implications, parents may need to avoid giving other gifts to the same beneficiary for the next five years. Parents might consider working with a tax professional for guidance when making these decisions.; 0
0065.00019; The age-based funds offered by many 529 savings plans allow for a set-it-and-forget-it approach to investing. The fund will invest more aggressively when the child is young and transition to a more conservative portfolio as the child approaches college age.; 0
0065.00020; If you're familiar with target-date funds for retirement, the concept is similar.; 0
0065.00021; Cons : You may have heard that 529 plans have some potential drawbacks, as most financial products do. First, 529 savings plans come with different options and investment choices.; 0
0065.00022; One size does not fit all, so to speak. Therefore, you'll want to do careful research or work with a trusted financial professional.; 0
0065.00023; Find the plan that could give you the best combination of tax benefits, high-quality investment options, and low fees.; 0
0065.00024; Second, you'll want to be mindful of the potential tax penalties.; 0
0065.00025; If you withdraw the money for a purpose other than qualified education costs, you may owe income tax and a 10-percent tax penalty on withdrawn earnings.; 1
0065.00026; Federal income tax and penalties typically do not apply to withdrawn contributions, but any state tax breaks on contributions may have to be repaid. (Learn more: 529 mistakes)  529 prepaid tuition plans  The basics: 529 prepaid tuition plans let parents pay in advance for education at a particular university or group of universities.; 0
0065.00027; Payment is based on current tuition rates.; 0
0065.00028; It could make sense to choose one of these plans if you think tuition costs will rise faster than inflation and if you want to avoid the risks associated with stock and bond investing. However, you will want to be aware of these plans' limitations as well as their benefits. 529 prepaid tuition plans are far less popular than 529 savings plans.; 0
0065.00029; At the end of 2018, both types of 529 plans combined held a total of $311.1 billion in assets, according to the Investment Company Institute .2  Of that total, $288.2 billion was held in 529 savings plans.; 0
0065.00030; Only $22.9 billion, or about 8 percent, was held in 529 prepaid tuition plans. Their lower popularity may be attributable to their lower flexibility and availability compared with 529 savings plans.; 1
0065.00031; Only 9 states offer prepaid tuition plans for public colleges and universities. Those states are Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington. Unlike 529 savings plans, you may need to be a resident of one of those states to participate in its prepaid tuition plan.; 0
0065.00032; For those with private school ambitions, the Private College 529 Plan offers a prepaid tuition plan for nearly 300 private universities across the United States . Included in the program are standouts such as Stanford, MIT, Spelman, and Princeton. Not all participating schools are elite institutions.; 0
0065.00033; Prepaid tuition credits do not affect admission choices by member schools.; 0
0065.00034; What happens if you want a refund of your prepaid tuition credits? Your options depend on the plan. The Private College plan allows you to change the beneficiary, do a rollover to another 529 plan, or get a refund.; 0
0065.00035; Like 529 savings plan withdrawals, prepaid plan refunds may be subject to taxes and penalties.; 0
0065.00036; With the state plans, options for redirecting or refunding prepaid tuition vary by plan, but you do have options.; 0
0065.00037; Other vehicles  529s aren't the only college savings options. The alternatives are less popular, but may be of interest to some families.; 0
0065.00038; Coverdell Education Savings Accounts (ESAs): Coverdell ESAs offer the same federal tax breaks as 529 savings plans but do not offer any state tax breaks.; 0
0065.00039; As the account balance grows, you'll owe state income taxes on the earnings.; 0
0065.00040; Also like 529 savings plans, you'll pay a 10 percent penalty on earnings withdrawn for purposes other than education.; 1
0065.00041; ESAs can be used for K - 12 education as well as higher education.; 0
0065.00042; Besides their tax treatment, these accounts have other important differences from 529 plans. They have a low contribution limit of $2,000 per year per beneficiary.; 0
0065.00043; The IRS imposes an income phaseout on contributions.; 0
0065.00044; Also, contributions can't be made after the beneficiary turns 18 (except for special-needs beneficiaries).; 0
0065.00045; And parents control the account only until the beneficiary turns 30.  UGMAs and UTMAs: Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) and Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) accounts are sometimes used to achieve tax savings by transferring assets from a higher-taxed parent to a lower-taxed child.; 0
0065.00046; Unlike 529s and ESAs, they do not offer state or federal tax breaks for college.; 0
0065.00047; They do allow for large contributions, though it's important to be aware of gift-tax implications.; 0
0065.00048; Investment options are nearly limitless, too.; 0
0065.00049; While the child is a minor, the parent can use the money in the account to pay for expenses that benefit the child.; 0
0065.00050; The child gains full control over the account upon reaching the age of majority (18 or 21 depending on the plan and state) and may not use the money how parents wish they would. In general, we try to steer away from using UGMA and UTMA accounts unless there is a unique circumstance, said Certified Financial Planner™ professional Adam Beaty of Bullogic Wealth Management near Houston. The reason we steer away from UGMA and UTMA accounts is that they are considered the child's assets.; 0
0065.00051; This is problematic when trying to receive financial aid.; 0
0065.00052; Colleges expect about 20 percent of the balance in these accounts to be used toward college expenses. However, a family that is so wealthy that they will not qualify for financial aid may gain modest tax savings from using these accounts to save money in the child's name, Kantrowitz said.; 0
0065.00053; Conclusion  Our most recent MassMutual College Planning and Savings Study revealed that only 28 percent of families who anticipate that their kids will go to college plan to use a tax-deferred savings program such as a 529 plan. Join these families and you may help put your child's college goals within easier reach. Discover more from MassMutual...; 0

0067.00020; Currently, it is up about 15% for the year but swelled up to 35% in July. This added volatility and lack of dividend compared to the other firms discussed may make conservative investors more reluctant to own Cowen. Investing in Oppenheimer (NYSE:OPY) provides exposure to a mid-market bank and its dividend but does not provide voting rights because nearly all its voting stock, or Class B shares, is entirely owned (97.5%) by Chairman and CEO Albert G.

Sometimes someone listens, she said.; 0
0068.00002; By Mark Brown@MarkBrownCST  Share All sharing options for: Northfield woman's plea prompts assessor's relief for floodplain homeowners Jane Goldenberg wrote a personal letter to Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi, arguing his office needed to give consideration to homes that are located on a floodplain such as hers on Meadowview Drive in Northfield. Provided  The owners of about 1,100 homes in New Trier Township ought to consider throwing a party for Jane Goldenberg  -  or at least send her a nice thank you note.; 0
0068.00003; Goldenberg is the individual who tried to convince Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi to take into account whether homes are located on a floodplain when his office values property for real estate tax purposes.; 0
0068.00004; And in so doing, Goldenberg collectively saved those homeowners a ton of money on their future tax bills  -  assuming the Cook County Board of Review concurs with Kaegi's unprecedented approach to lowering their assessments.; 0
0068.00005; Goldenberg says she did it the old-fashioned way, by writing a personal letter, which she sent through the U.S. Postal Service  -  with a stamp and everything  -  to someone she's never met.; 0
0068.00006; [Nor given a campaign donation, for you cynics.]; 0
0068.00007; Dear Assessor Kaegi, Goldenberg began, bypassing the formal property tax appeal system and eschewing the instant gratification of an email in a desperate hope of getting somebody's attention. I thought it would get more noticed that way, Goldenberg said.; 0
0068.00008; She was right.; 0
0068.00009; It did get noticed.; 0
0068.00010; The assessor's office decided to study the issue and then, in a surprise move last month, lowered the assessments on 1,136 homes in the floodplain  - most of them in Winnetka  -  by an average of 19 percent.; 1
0068.00011; Her Northfield home is one of them.; 0
0068.00012; Jane Goldenberg Provided  Goldenberg, a writer and a former Northfield village trustee, said it just goes to show the importance of speaking up when you think your government is making a mistake. Sometimes someone listens, Goldenberg said.; 0
0068.00013; I've already expressed my skepticism about Kaegi's decision to seek a mass correction of assessments on the New Trier floodplain homes, giving what I consider to be questionable tax breaks to folks in some of Cook County's poshest neighborhoods.; 0
0068.00014; But I have to say Goldenberg makes a very persuasive case about her own situation. Goldenberg, 59, and her husband reside on Meadowview Drive, near the Skokie River, where they've lived since 1991. In September of 2008, massive rainfall in northeastern Illinois caused major flooding.; 0
0068.00015; Nine counties, including Cook, were declared federal disaster areas. Goldenberg's home was among the hardest hit when the storm sewers backed up, turning her end of the street into a retention pond.; 0
0068.00016; Eventually, she and her husband tore down the old house and built a new green one in conformance with FEMA guidelines, elevating the structure to remove it from the flood danger zone and building it without a basement.; 0
0068.00017; Even before that, Goldenberg successfully campaigned for construction of a new sewer system in the neighborhood to correct the design flaws that had contributed to the 2008 flood. They haven't had any problems since then, she said. As a climate activist, Goldenberg knows she can't rule out future weather calamities, but she doesn't expect the property to flood again.; 0
0068.00018; Yet when she and her husband put the house up for sale two and a half years ago, they found the real estate marketplace less convinced than the tax assessor, which all along had continued to value her home much higher than anyone wanted to pay of it.; 0
0068.00019; Then this year's proposed reassessment arrived, valuing the house even higher at $2.3 million.; 1
0068.00020; I thought, 'Oh, no!'; 0
0068.00021; Actually, I cried, Goldenberg said, correcting herself. Even buyers that were interested in the home were scared off by the high taxes, she said.; 0
0068.00022; Meanwhile, a neighbor sold her house for about half of its assessed value, a clear indication something was amiss with valuations on her street.; 0
0068.00023; That's when Goldenberg wrote her letter. We hope you can figure out a way to ensure victims of natural disaster don't get devastated again by unfair property assessments, she concluded.; 0
0068.00024; Goldenberg said she was stunned when she got a call from the assessor's office informing her of the decision to reduce the New Trier floodplain assessments. She was especially gratified to hear that, going forward, the assessor's office was promising to use floodplain impact as a factor in evaluating assessments throughout the county. Goldenberg's house is currently under contract to a buyer who is paying less than the $1.4 million asking price, which was already below even the assessor's new corrected market value of $1.5 million.; 0

0069.00007; -  - Diabetic neuropathy (Wikimedia Commons)  Findings from the phase 3 trial revealed that Egensis DNA was mixed up in some placebo group subjects, while some subjects in the Engensis group showed overly low Engensis DNA concentrations.; 0
0069.00008; These unexpected pharmacokinetic results clouded the interpretation of the functions of Engensis, Helixmith said. Helixmith convened an investors' meeting at the NH Investment and Securities building in Yeouido, Seoul, in the early morning of Tuesday, where it explained that a fault must have occurred at the hospital administering Engensis for clinical trial. A sudden increase in the subject number appeared to have compromised the management of the clinical trial, said Kim Sun-young, founder of Helixmith, at the explanation session.; 0
0069.00009; The company said it would share details with the US' Food and Drug Administration in a meeting scheduled for December. Helixmith said the safety profile of Engensis remained unchanged, but that the efficacy of the drug was not statistically meaningful. Due to the unexpected pharmacokinetic results, it is impossible to derive accurate conclusions about the efficacy of Engensis as of now, Helixmith said.; 0
0069.00010; The company will set up an investigation team led by Leonard Fish, a clinical expert, to analyze the pharmacokinetic results. Smaller phase 3 trials are in plans to begin in the next six months, with a new finish estimated for around early 2022. By Lim Jeong-yeo (kaylalim@heraldcorp.com); 0

0071.00001; Baringo Senator Gideon Moi (left) when he paid a courtesy call on South Sudan's President Salva Kiir at State House, Juba, in April 2019.; 0
0071.00002; PHOTO | NMG POOL  By KIPCHUMBA SOME  Baringo Senator Gideon Moi is among a group of powerful international businessmen and multinational companies who are profiting from the ongoing conflict in South Sudan, claims a new report.; 0
0071.00003; The report titled The Taking of South Sudan was prepared by the Sentry, a non-profit investigative team founded by American actor George Clooney to monitor conflicts in Africa. STAKES  The 64-page report alleges that South Sudan President Salva Kiir and his family own stakes in banks, foreign exchange bureaus, airlines, oil companies, logistics firms, private security companies among others, mainly through partnerships with investors from across the globe. It alleges that Senator Moi has a stake in a South Sudan-registered firm Lukiza Ltd, which formed a joint venture called Caltec Corporation with Conex Energy, a company allegedly controlled by President Kiir's daughter Adut.; 0
0071.00004; Just two months after the December 2013 massacres in Juba, Conex Energy, a company controlled by Kiir's daughter Adut, his son-in-law Nardos Ghebeyehu and Akot Lual Arech  -  a close adviser to the President affiliated with the NSS (National Security Services)  -  formed the joint venture Caltec Corporation with South Sudan-registered Lukiza Limited, said the report.; 0
0071.00005; It added: Gideon Moi, an influential senator who is the son of former Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, has a partial ownership stake in Lukiza.; 0
0071.00006; Caltec's website describes the firm as a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to specifically engage in the provision of services in the oil sector, waste management, drilling, logistics and air transportation are among the services it says it provides.' In response, the Senator through his aide Alex Kiprotich, Saturday dismissed the report as work of fantasy and fiction. All those allegations are nothing but pure lies, he said.; 0
0071.00007; LEGAL SUIT  I am not a shareholder of the company and I have never and I am not profiting from the proceeds of war as alleged in the fictitious report. I have neither received any single cent from the government of South Sudan nor am I doing any business with the South Sudan government. My lawyers are already in the process of instituting legal proceedings against The Sentry and its authors, he said.; 0
0071.00008; His father, retired President Moi, was instrumental in mediating the South Sudan peace process when he was president from 1978 to 2002 and has maintained close contacts with the country's leaders since then.; 0
0071.00009; In May, President Kiir visited Mr Moi at his home in Kabarak to condole with him following the passing of his first born son Jonathan. According to a statement released from the office of the former president, the two leaders also talked about peace initiatives in the troubled South Sudan.; 0
0071.00010; Another Kenyan businessman mentioned in the report as having close business links with members of South Sudan's first family is Krupa Patel, who is alleged to have formed a consortium called Finejet S.S. Limited with Kenyan oil supplier Finejet Africa Holdings Limited.; 0
0071.00011; President Kiir's daughter Adut is alleged to have a stake in the consortium. DISPLACED  A fellow Kenyan businessman mentioned in the report as having business ties with President Kiir's family is Abdikadir Osman Ahmed, who is alleged to co-own a company called Cannington Investment with another of President Kiir's daughters called Anok.; 0
0071.00012; As far as international partnerships go, the report alleges that, in March 2016, three Chinese citizens  -  He Yuheng, Chen Huiping and Chen Yongqiang  -  partnered with President Kiir's daughter Winnie to launch Fortune Minerals and Construction Ltd in South Sudan.; 0
0071.00013; Six weeks after Fortune Minerals received its licence in the Amadi State city of Mundri, government troops reportedly destroyed health centres, committed mass rapes and forcibly displaced tens of thousands of people.; 0
0071.00014; By June 2017, amid reports of rampant sexual and gender-based violence, the UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan described Mundri as the epicentre of the problem due to the recent increase in fighting … between rebels and government troops, said the report. CIVIL WAR  Overall, the report alleges members of President Kiir's immediate family are shareholders and directors in companies alongside dozens of foreign nationals of 13 different countries, among them Australia, the United States of America, Canada, Britain and China.; 0
0071.00015; The report alleges that American arms dealer Ara Dolarian tried to sell weapons worth $43 million (Sh4.3 billion) to General Paul Malong, the much-feared former chief of general staff of South Sudan Peoples' Liberation Army (SPLA) who was sacked by President Kiir in 2017.; 0
0071.00016; According to the report, Gen Malong, who is under United Nations sanctions for his alleged role in prolonging the civil war, was in the process of forming an armed opposition movement in Kenya after falling out with the government in Juba.; 0
0071.00017; An invoice on Dolarian Capital letterhead addressed to Paul Malong lists $43.2 million worth of weapons and ammunition, including mortar systems, RPG launchers, assault rifles and ZU-23 mobile anti-aircraft guns, said the report.; 0
0071.00018; According to the invoice, the Sentry report said, the weapons were to be sold to First Monetary Security Limited, a Kenyan company ostensibly linked to Malong, thus illustrating how foreign companies can be used to facilitate weapons transfers. This attempted weapons deal suggests that Malong retained access to significant amount of funds following his departure from Juba, said The Sentry report.; 0
0071.00019; STOLEN  When he was stopped outside of Juba in May 2017, Malong was carrying the equivalent of millions of US dollars in cash allegedly stolen from the SPLA treasury, said the Sentry dossier.; 0
0071.00020; Since he used a Kenyan company to set up the deal, the Sentry suggested that Kenya could potentially investigate the company involved and the source of funds. Previous reports by the organisation claimed Gen Malong maintains a $2 million (Sh200 million) mansion in Nairobi's upscale gated Nyari Estate, as well as two luxury homes in Uganda.; 0
0071.00021; Dolarian was charged in May this year in a court in California with illegally brokering the sale of military-grade arms and munitions, money laundering and conspiracy.; 0
0071.00022; In June 2019, he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the Arms Export Control Act. The Sentry report urged Kenyan authorities to investigate and seize real estate properties possibly belonging to South Sudanese Political Exposed Persons and prevent the misuse of its real estate sector. The dossier also linked Gen Malong to another war profiteer, a Sudanese businessman called Ashraf Seed Ahmed Hussein, who is widely known by his pseudonym Al-Cardinal.; 0
0071.00023; As the civil war raged on in January 2016, he established Wara Wara Investments with Gen Malong and became a shareholder in the company.; 0
0071.00024; The name of the company is a nod to the birthplace of Gen Malong. VIOLATIONS  Wara Wara was allegedly incorporated on January 27, 2016  -  just a day after the UN Panel of Experts released its first report on the South Sudan conflict, in which Malong's name was mentioned 17 times in connection with human rights violations.; 0
0071.00025; Al-Cardinal's connections with the South Sudan government precedes the country's independence.; 0
0071.00026; In April 2006, just over a year after the signing of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement with Khartoum, Al-Cardinal reportedly received a contract from the transitional government of South Sudan to procure Toyota Land Cruisers for the army.; 0
0071.00027; The Ministry of Finance accepted an offer from Al-Cardinal's reported partner in the deal, Arop Trading and Investment Company Ltd, which inflated the cost of 200 Hiluxes and 100 Land Cruisers by approximately $24,000 and $40,000 a unit, respectively. Eight months later, Al-Cardinal purchased a £1,150,000 London property in cash (equivalent to £1,600,000 in 2018, or approximately $1,957,258), said The Sentry report.; 1
0071.00028; In March 2007, reports surfaced that Al-Cardinal had sold 300 significantly marked up vehicles to the army, precipitating both his arrest and the arrest of Martin Malual Arop, Arop Trading's owner. TRACTORS  However, with the outbreak of war in 2013, Al-Cardinal's logistics company was back in business after it was contracted to import spare parts for the army's GAZ-34039 armoured vehicles.; 0
0071.00029; Russian export records available through a public database indicate that the first shipment of GAZ 34039-32 vehicles consigned to Green for Logistics Services LLC was declared in Mombasa, Kenya on August 11, 2014. Additional shipments were declared on August 22, September 29 and November 11, 2014, said the report.; 0
0071.00030; While Green for Logistics handled wartime military procurement contracts, Al Cardinal General Trading was reportedly awarded a non-competitive contract in 2015 to import 1,000 tractors through Belarusian supplier Minsk Tractor Works. Many of the tractors were said to be outdated.; 0
0071.00031; When the tractors were finally delivered more than a year later, 200 of the 1,000 vehicles were reportedly given to the South Sudanese army rather than the food insecure communities they had ostensibly been intended to serve, said the Sentry report.; 0
0071.00032; A 2017 commitment letter from the Ministry of Petroleum indicates that Al-Cardinal Investment Company Limited has been receiving payments in barrels of crude oil since January 2018 in lieu of capital for its outstanding bill with the government, against the law.; 0
0071.00033; MILITIA  The report further accused a consortium made up of Chinese and Malaysian state-owned oil companies operating in South Sudan of providing material support to a pro-government militia that went on to commit atrocities, including violence against civilians, the burning of entire villages and an attack on a UN protection-of-civilians site. Dar Petroleum, a company in which China National Petroleum Corporation and Malaysia's Petronas own 41 per cent and 40 per cent respectively, is said to have close ties to the intelligence apparatus, contributed to significant environmental degradation and made payments to underwrite the petroleum minister's lavish lifestyle.; 0
0071.00034; According to the report, Dar Petroleum currently produces around 185,000 barrels per day from two oil blocks in Upper Nile State  -  one in Paloch and another in nearby Adar  -  or around 80 per cent of the total oil produced daily in South Sudan.; 0
0071.00035; Dar Patroleum's facilities became hotly contested territory almost immediately after South Sudan's civil war began in mid-December 2013 between the government and the rebels led by former Vice President Riek Machar. CORRESPONDENCE  Internal records and e-mail correspondence reviewed by The Sentry indicate that Dar Petroleum played a role in providing supplies to this militia and other military units from September 2014 to July 2015, said the report.; 0
0071.00036; It further stated: In total, The Sentry has viewed 11 separate e-mail messages from (Gieth Abraham) Dauson (an aide to then petroleum Stephen Dhieu) requesting the delivery of a total of 251 barrels of diesel fuel from Dar Petroleum to military and militia forces in Upper Nile. Dar Petroleum also has significant ties to South Sudan's National Security Service (NSS).; 0
0071.00037; Its vice president Ramadan Chadar Dhok is a major general in the NSS as of May 2017. In addition to past service as a spokesperson, Maj Gen Chadar has also directed Sudd Security Services Ltd, a security company confidentially owned and operated by the NSS, according to a memo reviewed by the Sentry.; 0
0071.00038; Eritrean businessman Ghebremeskel Tesfamariam Ghidey, widely known as Gebre, is also accused by the Sentry of receiving more than $57 million (Sh5.7 billion) through Letters of Credit for goods he never delivered.; 1
0071.00039; COMPLICIT  After South Sudan's government halted oil production in 2012 amid a dispute with Khartoum, shortfalls in US dollars made importing goods next to impossible, so the government secured $922 million through oil-backed loans from Qatar National Bank and Stanbic Bank to finance procurement.; 1
0071.00040; The funds were allocated as letters of credit to more than a thousand private companies.; 0
0071.00041; These companies were supposed to procure and import goods from neighbouring countries. The cash went out, but, according to the audit report, hardly any of the goods promised reached their ostensibly intended destinations.; 0
0071.00042; South Sudan-registered companies owned by Gebre received 21 of the letters of credit identified in the audit report, worth a combined total of $30 million (Sh3 billion).; 1
0071.00043; None of the companies that reportedly failed to deliver supplies faced sanctions or government repayments.; 0
0071.00044; Government officials involved in the programme have also avoided consequences, said the Sentry.; 0
0071.00045; British tycoon David Greenhalgh, who built a fortune through his aviation consulting firm, is also accused in the report of being complicit in the loss of $65 million (Sh6.5 billion) from the treasury of South Sudan.; 0
0071.00046; CHILD SOLDIERS  The first transfer reportedly occurred on December 15, 2009, when pre-independence Southern Sudan's Ministry of Finance paid $65 million to Uganda-registered Cascade Construction as payment for a mobile system for aviation management and monitoring central unit, complete with radar and other equipment.; 1
0071.00047; The funds reportedly paid to Cascade  -  and then to Airservices  -  apparently changed hands numerous times, passing through banks in several foreign jurisdictions before millions were used to purchase property and vehicles outside Southern Sudan. Funds originating from the deal reportedly transited through bank accounts held by Greenhalgh's companies in multiple jurisdictions and were eventually flagged as suspicious and frozen, said the dossier. In addition, a pair of British businessmen  -  Abdelkarim Adam Eisa Mohamed and Dawd Adam Rife Abute  -  are also accused of entering into partnership with Lieutenant General David Yau Yau who stands accused of recruiting child soldiers.; 0
0071.00048; 24 WOMEN  In early 2015, the duo, together with Gen Yau Yau formed the National Depot Petroleum Development, an oil services company. Mohamed and Rife are also the largest shareholders in National Credit Bank, whose opening in South Sudan in May 2013 was graced by the former IMF managing director Dominique StraussKahn.; 0

0073.00001; How much tax do you pay on your dividends?; 0
0073.00002; If you own a small limited company your shares entitle you to draw a return on your shareholding  -  in common parlance these returns are called dividends.; 0
0073.00003; A company can only pay dividends if it has current or accumulated tax-paid reserves. For most smaller companies this will be described as reserves or retained profits on your company balance sheet.; 0
0073.00004; As these reserves are made up of retained profits after corporation tax has been paid, if you take a dividend the underlying profits have already been taxed at 19%  -  the current corporation tax rate.; 1
0073.00005; Unfortunately, when you receive the dividend this is deemed to be taxable income and will be subject to further, hybrid rates of Income Tax.; 0
0073.00006; For the tax year 2019-20 the rates of dividend tax applied are:  The first £2,000 of dividends received are tax-free. Dividends that fall to be taxed as part of your basic rate Income Tax band are taxed at 7.5%.; 0
0073.00007; Dividends that fall to be taxed as part of your higher rate Income Tax band are taxed at 32.5%, and Dividends that fall to be taxed as part of your additional rate Income Tax band are taxed at 38.1%.; 0
0073.00008; For shareholders whose income, including dividends, falls into the higher or additional rate bands, the additional dividend tax payable can be significant. However, dividends are not subject to National Insurance and if you need to take funds from your company, withdrawing the bulk of your remuneration package as dividends can still be an attractive option.; 0

Close Me Last Updated: 24 September 2019 Forming a critical part of efforts to broaden investor bases in light of rising economic and geopolitical uncertainty, Fund Services Manager, Kathryn Miller highlights how banks in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are making it more attractive for foreign investors to invest by relaxing their foreign ownership limits (FOL).; 0
0075.00003; In recent years throughout the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) bloc there has been a necessary shift to open up their capital markets to foreign investment.; 0
0075.00004; As a result, economic diversification has taken centre stage, responding to unpredictable oil prices and political tensions across the Gulf region and beyond. Perhaps the region's staunchest advocate for relaxing foreign investment laws has been the UAE, successfully boosting its non-oil economy to over 70% of national GDP .; 0
0075.00005; In addition to granting 100% foreign ownership across 13 industries onshore late last year, its most influential banks are now raising their FOL. Its largest bank, First Abu Dhabi Bank PJSC has even proposed removing the FOL altogether following its share price increase that was prompted by raising limits to 40% in February.; 0
0075.00006; More recently in September, Dubai's largest bank, Emirates NBD PJSC raised its limits from 5% to 20% and on 2 September announced its intentions to seek shareholder approval to double it to 40% - a move that pushed its shares to a 12-year high.; 0

0076.00006; Description Abstract Text: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Brain Cancer Program (BCP), a multidisciplinary basic, translational, and clinical research program, includes 86 members (36 primary and 50 associate). Leadership is provided by physician-scientists: Amy Heimberger and Frederick Lang, both neurosurgeons Juan Fueyo-Margareto, a laboratory-based investigator and John de Groot, a neuro-oncologist. The overall goal of the BCP is to identify the genetic and molecular determinants of primary and metastatic brain tumor formation and progression and to use this knowledge to improve the survival and quality of life of patients through specifically targeted biological and small-molecule therapies.; 0
0076.00007; The program has 3 specific aims. Aim 1: To develop effective viral and immunotherapeutic treatment strategies that exploit glioblastoma heterogeneity.; 0
0076.00008; Aim 2: To determine how to optimize targeted approaches for central nervous system tumors.; 0
0076.00009; Aim 3: To define factors that promote the development of central nervous system metastases, devise strategies to prevent their formation, develop early detection or identify at-risk patients, and prioritize optimal therapeutic approaches. The BCP's annual direct peer-reviewed funding is $5.7M, including a Brain Cancer SPORE.; 0
0076.00010; Of the total peer-reviewed funding, $2.1M (37%) is from NCI grants, and $3.6M is from other peer-reviewed sources. BCP members have authored 703 publications in peer-reviewed journals over the past 6 years, of which 362 (51%) were intra-programmatic, 170 (24%) were inter-programmatic, and 485 (69%) involved external collaborations.; 0
0076.00011; Forty-one percent of publications have appeared in journals with IF >5, and 13% have appeared in journals with IF >10, including Nature, Cancer Cell, Mol Cell, Lancet Oncol, J Clin Oncol, J Natl Cancer Inst, J Clin Invest, and Nat Genet.; 0
0076.00012; Accomplishments include major contributions to The Cancer Genome Atlas and key leadership roles in the international glioblastoma Adaptive Global Innovative Learning Environment Bayesian Clinical Trial. During the last grant period, members of the BCP made important contributions in evaluating transcriptome plasticity and radiation resistance in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) (Bhat et al, Cancer Cell, 2013) and the roles of Quaking in self-renewal and preventing terminal differentiation of GSCs (Hu J et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 2013 Shingu et al, Nat Genet, 2017), WNT5a in driving GSC differentiation into endothelial-like cells that support invasive glioblastoma cells (Hu B et al, Cell, 2016), and PKM2 in altering cell metabolism and cell-cycle progression with the Cancer Biology and Metastasis Program (Yang et al, Mol Cell, 2012 Yang et al, Cell, 2012 Jiang Y et al, Mol Cell, 2014 Jiang Y et al, Nat Commun, 2014).; 0
0076.00013; Another important advance by BCP members is the use of stereotactic radiosurgery after brain metastasis resection as an alternative to whole-brain radiotherapy, which has influenced the standard of care for these patients nationally (Mahajan A et al, Lancet Oncol, 2017). We have seen a 50% decrease in the use of whole- brain irradiation at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.; 0

0079.00003; But after 12 months of welcoming drivers, figures released through a Freedom of Information (FOI) request show that the council's latest car park missed its first financial target by £286,000. Just 92 people parked in the car park on June 23 this year - taking £171, while the busiest day, December 20, saw £4,728 paid by 2,124 drivers. After a slow start to business in August 2018, the car park is now generating a net income of around £12,000 every week - still about £4,000 short of the average weekly target.; 1

0083.00001; By Sharmila Reddy Leave a Comment  What is Translation Risk? Translation Risk is the risk of change in the financial position of the company (assets, liabilities, equity) due to exchange rate changes and is usually seen while reporting the consolidated financial statements of multiple subsidiaries operating overseas in domestic currency.; 0
0083.00002; The effect is mainly on the multinational firms which operate in international transactions intentionally because of their customer and supplier base. In this scenario translation risk is more like a continues phenomenon that needs to be recorded every year in the financial statements.; 0
0083.00003; Additionally, it also affects the firms that have assets in the foreign currency and the same need to be realized or reported in the domestic currency.; 0
0083.00004; This is mostly a one-time phenomenon and proper accounting procedures need to be implemented else it may lead to legal hassles. Since currency fluctuations are difficult to predict, translation risk can be unpredictable which makes it more complex to report and hence is watched closely by regulatory bodies. Translation risk is different from transaction risk which affects the firm's cash flow due to the currency volatility risk.; 0
0083.00005; Let's consider a simple example of translation risk and how it affects the firms.; 0
0083.00006; Consider a Multi-National corporation operating in UK and US geographies.; 0
0083.00007; By operating we mean, the firm has assets and liabilities in both the countries.; 0
0083.00008; Let's assume the US office of this firm suffers an operating loss of $ 10,000. However, the UK division in the same reporting period makes a net profit of £ 8,000.; 0
0083.00009; Now since the conversion rate of dollar and pound is 0.80, the firm effectively doesn't make any loss or profit.; 0

So far so good.; 0
0083.00011; Now before the parent company consolidates all these figures and prepares the interim financial reports, there is a change in macroeconomic scenarios. The BREXIT discussions have intensified which has affected the price of the Pound sterling.; 0
0083.00012; Similarly, because of economic tensions between the US and Iran in the middle east, the crude price and dollar price have fluctuated. These scenarios lead to the shift in the dollar pound exchange rate from .80 to 1.0.; 1
0083.00013; The profit which was canceled out due to gain in the UK division has all of a sudden became very small leading to a net gain for the parent company.; 0
0083.00014; The table below summarizes both the scenarios.; 0
0083.00015; This effectively means that even though at the time of realization there was no profit/loss, now the company should report a loss as the scenarios have changed because of currency fluctuations. Although hypothetical, this is one of the simplest examples of Translation risk.; 0
0083.00016; Translation risk is usually a legal driven change required by regulators. It arises only when the parent company decides to report a consolidated financial statement.; 0
0083.00017; For example, if FMCG major Unilever reports a consolidated financial statement for its US, UK, and Europe subsidiary, it will face translation risk.; 0
0083.00018; However, if it keeps these subsidiary companies independent, there does not arise any case of translation risk.; 0
0083.00019; Simply put translation risk is not a change in the cash flow but only a result of reporting consolidated financials. Since this risk does not affect the cash flow but only the reporting structure, no question arises of any tax exemption that the firm can make use of.; 0
0083.00020; Also, there is no change in the value of the firm because of translation risk, unlike other risk and exposures. In simple terms, it is more of a measurable concept rather than the cash flow concept.; 0
0083.00021; An important point to note is that it is recorded when reported and not when realized.; 0
0083.00022; Hence it won't be wrong to say that it results only in notional gain or losses. The risk arising because of translation risk sits on the as translation exposure. There can be multiple methods to measure it like Current/no current method, monetary/ non-monetary method, temporal method, and current rate method.; 0
0083.00023; Similarly, firms can utilize multiple ways to manage this exposure like using derivative/exotic financial products like currency options, currency swaps, and forward contracts.; 0
0083.00024; We will skip the details around these as these are complex topics and can be covered separately.; 0
0083.00025; Translation risk poses a threat in terms of presenting unexpected figures upfront which can lead to some harsh questions raised by shareholders for the management.; 0
0083.00026; However, if the situation is a temporary one and the unexpected fluctuations in currency might return to normal then it should not affect the firm much.; 0
0083.00027; This is because these might get reversed in the next accounting period when the have improved, and the currency market has moved in the favorable direction of the firm.; 0
0083.00028; However, this should not be a reason for not preparing for translation risk and management should have proper procedures in place to counter such unfavorable movements in currency. Translation exposure arising from translation risk is certain for firms which operate in foreign transactions or deal in foreign currencies.; 0
0083.00029; Its is more of a corporate treasury concept used to describe risks that a company faces when it deals with foreign clients thereby foreign transactions. These foreign transactions can be anything like paying their suppliers in a different currency or getting payments from their customers in foreign currency.; 0
0083.00030; An entity that wants to mitigate translation risk should engage in hedging through derivatives or exotic financial products so that the currency fluctuations have minimal effect on its numbers. Failing to do so may result not in legal hassles but also investor fury even though the firm might be dealing only in a one-time international transaction.; 0
0083.00031; Needless to say, for a listed firm it becomes all the more important as any such red flag might lead investors to lose confidence in the firm. This has been a guide to what is translation risk and its definition.; 0

0084.00001; Sean Gallup | Getty  The ride-hailing companies want to create a third category of workers. That's had mixed results in other countries.; 0
0084.00002; by Angela Chen  Sep 13, 2019  This week, California passed a bill that would make gig workers - including Uber and Lyft drivers - employees instead of independent contractors. It's a big blow for ride-hailing firms in the state and the start of a long battle. A spokesperson for Uber has already stated that it won't reclassify its workers because drivers aren't a core part of its business.; 0
0084.00003; (The new bill, called AB5, clarifies that people are employees if their work is central to the business. Uber's claim is certain to be debated.); 0
0084.00004; Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash have also pledged $90 million to fund a campaign to let residents vote on whether these workers should have a new classification, one that that is neither employee nor independent contractor.; 0
0084.00005; Though not used in the US, this third category has been implemented in other countries - and, in some cases, the results are a cautionary tale.; 0
0084.00006; Here's what that category means for Uber and Lyft drivers and the future of work.; 0
0084.00007; What is this third category of worker?; 0
0084.00008; In the US, the exact definition and rights of an employee can vary at the state level, but there are only two categories of workers: employees and independent contractors.; 0
0084.00009; Other countries, though, have more classifications. The United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, Canada, Italy, and South Korea all have this in-between category, according to Miriam Cherry, an employment law expert at St. Louis University.; 0
0084.00010; They have different names, such as worker in the UK or trade in Spain.; 0

0084.00012; What can third category workers get and don't get?; 0
0084.00013; Employees usually receive federal minimum wage and, among other benefits, sick leave, paid vacation time, Social Security, and Medicare.; 0
0084.00014; Independent contractors are not entitled to these benefits. In addition, they can't sue for sexual harassment or gender discrimination under federal law because workplace civil rights laws only apply to employees.; 0
0084.00015; There's no hard-and-fast rule for what third category workers receive.; 0
0084.00016; In some countries they receive minimum wage and in others, they don't.; 0
0084.00017; In Europe, one issue of contention was vacation, says Cherry. Unions and workers have really fought for time for people to take a vacation, but employers have complained and that is one of the things in their third category that is less generous, she says.; 0
0084.00018; But the US doesn't have generous vacation leave policies anyway, so, ironically, there are fewer rights to lose.; 0
0084.00019; Another big question is whether third-category workers will be allowed to unionize.; 0
0084.00020; Federally, independent contractors are not allowed to unionize but Uber and Lyft have said they would support sectoral bargaining, which would allow drivers industry-wide to bargain collectively.; 0
0084.00021; Before the California bill passed, the companies had tried to negotiate by offering a new $21 hourly minimum wage (but only when a passenger is in the car, so time spent finding passengers and driving to pick someone up doesn't count).; 0
0084.00022; Cherry points out that it can be extremely difficult to implement a third category. You're basically saying they're not going to get as many rights, so then you have to decide what to take away and all those things are very difficult decisions, she says.; 0
0084.00023; I'd have to say I'm against it because the devil is in the details.; 0
0084.00024; How has the third category worked out in other countries?; 0
0084.00025; The results have been mixed. In the United Kingdom, gig workers in this third category have won minimum wage and paid holidays.; 0
0084.00026; But in Italy, many companies simply moved their previously full-time employees into the new category, leaving them with fewer benefits. For her part, Shona Clarkson, lead organizer with the activist campaign Gig Workers Rising, says that proposal from ride-hailing companies are a watered-down version of what drivers have been demanding for years and does not fulfill their other needs.; 0
0084.00027; Gig Workers Rising will continue to fight for drivers to be full employees, she says, adding that the $90 million campaign is evidence that these companies are afraid.; 1

0087.00001; 618.639.9202  Social Security: The $64,000 Question One of the most common questions people ask about Social Security is when they should start taking benefits.; 0
0087.00002; This is the $64,000 question.; 0
0087.00003; Making the right decision for you can have a meaningful impact on your financial income in retirement. Before considering how personal circumstances and objectives may play into your decision, it may be helpful to preface that discussion with an illustration of how benefits may differ based upon the age at which you commence taking Social Security. As the accompanying chart reflects, the amount you receive will be based upon the age at which you begin taking benefits.; 0
0087.00004; Monthly Benefit Amounts  Based on the Age that Benefits Begin¹  - Age - Benefit Amount  -  62  63  64  65  66 and 4 months  67  68  69  70  -  $953  $1,018  $1,097  $1,184  $1,300  $1,369  $1,473  $1,577  $1,681  This example assumes a benefit amount of $1,300 at the full retirement age of 66 and 4 months. At first blush, the decision may seem a bit clear-cut: Simply calculate the lifetime value of the early benefit amount versus the lifetime value of the higher benefit, based on some assumed life expectancy.; 0
0087.00005; The calculus is a bit more complicated than that because of the more favorable tax treatment of Social Security income versus IRA withdrawals, spousal benefit coordination opportunities, the consideration of the surviving spouse, and Social Security's lifetime income guarantee that exists under current law.²  Here are three ideas to think about when making your decision:  Do You Need the Money?; 0
0087.00006; Retiring before full retirement age may be a personal choice or one that is thrust upon you because of circumstances, such as declining health or job loss. If you need the income that Social Security is scheduled to provide, however reduced, then taking benefits early may be the only choice for you. Consider the Needs of Your Spouse  If your spouse expects to depend on your Social Security income, the survivor benefits he or she receives after your death may be reduced substantially if you begin taking benefits early.; 0
0087.00007; It's important to remember that, based on current life expectancy tables, women are likely to live longer than men. Are You Healthy?; 0
0087.00008; The primary risk in retirement is running out of money.; 0
0087.00009; The odds of living a long life in retirement calls for waiting until you reach full retirement age, so that you receive a full benefit for as long as you live.; 0
0087.00010; However, if your current health is poor, then starting earlier may make sense for you.; 0
0087.00011; There are several elements you should evaluate before you start claiming Social Security. By determining your priorities and other income opportunities, you may be able to better decide at what age benefits make the most sense.; 0
0087.00012; Social Security Administration, 2018 Withdrawals from traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income and, if taken before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty.; 1

Some representatives of the Qatari royal family have held talks with an international recruiting firm as they review potential executives, according to people familiar with the matter.; 0

0089.00002; A fleet of the New Routemasters had been ordered by the then mayor Boris Johnson  -  and so became known as Boris Buses. The new bus even had a starring role on Top Gear, racing with supercars. It was a triumphant time for the Ballymena business, but now it's been brought low, set to fall into into administration.; 0
0089.00003; The company's financial stress became public knowledge in July.; 0
0089.00004; It admitted it was working with business advisors Deloitte to find potential investors. This confirmed months of rumours that had been swirling around Ballymena.; 0
0089.00005; The first sign of problems could be seen in the firm's most recently-published accounts.; 0
0089.00006; Image caption   The launch of the new Routemaster was a high point for Wrightbus  The top company in the Wright business, the Cornerstone Group, showed the firm made a loss of £1.7m in 2017.; 1
0089.00007; That compared to a pre-tax profit of almost £11m in 2016. A note in the accounts said there was continued uncertainty in the UK market with a challenging outlook for all bus manufacturers.; 0
0089.00008; It also said the business was facing increased material prices due to exchange rates.; 0
0089.00009; That is a reference to the relative weakness of sterling since the Brexit vote, which makes it more expensive to buy components that are priced in euros or dollars.; 0
0089.00010; The company's financial position has deteriorated further since then.; 0
0089.00011; Wrightbus is a major employer in Ballymena with 1,400 employees.; 0
0089.00012; It can trace its history to the years after World War Two, when Robert Wright began making body work for vans and other vehicles.; 0
0089.00013; He was joined by his son William who was instrumental in transforming the business into a major bus builder. Image caption   The Wrightbus factory occupies a huge site in Ballymena  It broke into the UK market and then, under former chief executive Mark Nodder, grew its international presence. Buses were made for customers in Hong Kong and Singapore.; 0
0089.00014; A joint venture was set up in India. Just two years ago, the company bought a huge manufacturing site in Ballymena.; 0
0089.00015; It had been vacated by the cigarette company JTI when they pulled out of the County Antrim town.; 0
0089.00016; It was statement of intent by Wrightbus: We're growing and we're here to stay. So what's gone wrong? Demand for new buses in the UK, the key market for Wrightbus, is weak.; 0
0089.00017; Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) show that in the second quarter of this year new bus and coach registrations are down 30% compared to the same period last year. That marks the 10th quarter in a row that new registrations have declined. The bus market is cyclical and Wrights did benefit from a splurge of bus buying earlier this decade as operators updated their fleets to meet new regulatory requirements.; 0
0089.00018; But this down part of the cycle seems particularly pronounced.; 0
0089.00019; Image copyright  Getty Images  Image caption   For all its publicity, the Boris Bus did not land any export sales for Wrightbus  SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: The current climate of political and economic uncertainty, exacerbated by confusion around differing local authority requirements for clean air zones, is affecting operators' confidence and willingness to invest in the market. And for all its publicity the Boris Bus did not land any export sales for Wrightbus.; 0
0089.00020; Transport for London also stopped ordering it in 2016 as it fell out of favour with the the new mayor Sadiq Khan.; 0
0089.00021; Wrightbus's efforts to break into international markets have also not been enough to compensate for weakness in the UK. In recent years the company has paid out large donations to a religious charity, Green Pastures, which is led by Wrightbus's majority shareholder Jeff Wright. Image caption   Work at the new Green Pastures site appears to have stalled in recent months  Green Pastures received about £15m over six years, helping it to develop a huge church and village complex known as Project Gateway.; 0
0089.00022; Most of this money was paid at a time when the company was making large profits.; 0
0089.00023; Work at the Gateway site appears to have stalled in recent months.; 0
0089.00024; Wrightbus has developed expertise in electric and hydrogen-powered buses and these are expected to be a growing part of the market  So there's still some hope that something can be salvaged from this failure.; 0

0090.00001; Rothesay Life, the specialist insurer of defined benefit pension schemes, has agreed to a £4.7 billion bulk annuity insurance buy-out of the pension scheme of telent, the UK radio, telecommunication, and internet systems installation and services provider. The deal, which is the largest full scheme buy-out ever undertaken in the UK, provides security for the scheme's approximately 39,000 members, consisting of around 28,000 pensioners and 11,000 deferred pensioners.; 1
0090.00002; The buy-out is expected to be completed by the end of 2022, but will be preceded by a buy-in that will see the transfer of the scheme's current assets to Rothesay Life in return for an insurance policy that will fund the continued payment of members' benefits.; 0
0090.00003; During the buy-out phase of the transaction, pensioners will receive individual pension contracts or annuities with Rothesay Life, who will then take responsibility for paying members their benefits.; 0
0090.00004; All of the current terms and benefits will be replicated for all members, Rothesay Life assured, both 'in pension' and 'deferred'.; 0
0090.00005; Established in 2007, Rothesay Life is one of the largest specialist annuity providers in the UK market, with £42 billion of assets under management prior to this transaction.; 0
0090.00006; The company currently insures the pensions of over 770,000 individuals, paying a total of £1.9 billion in pension benefits each year.; 1
0090.00007; Rothesay Life was advised by Gowling WLG on this deal, while the Trustee Board of the telent pension scheme was advised by Aon and CMS.; 0
0090.00008; From our very first meeting with telent, the Trustee and Aon they could not have been clearer as to what was required for the buy-out to take place, said Sammy Cooper-Smith, Business Development at Rothesay Life.; 0
0090.00009; This direct articulation allowed us to focus our resources and attention to meet these requirements and ensure the completion of the largest full scheme buy-out ever undertaken in the UK.; 0
0090.00010; At every stage of the process all parties have worked constructively to achieve this landmark settlement and we are delighted to be providing a secure, long-term home for the 39,000 GEC Plan pensions, he continued.; 0
0090.00011; Our robust approach to risk management and the capital support from our shareholders allows us to give Trustees of large schemes confidence in our execution capability and continues to attract new clients.; 0
0090.00012; We have grown to become the UK's largest specialist annuity provider because the solutions we offer clients leave them free to invest in the future of their businesses, while securing the payment of all their pension promises. Heather Green, CFO of telent, also commented: The Trustee of the GEC1972 Plan has done a fantastic job to eliminate the significant funding deficit that existed in the Plan only 10 years ago and get the scheme to a position where it can benefit from the hugely more secure future that this transaction provides.; 0
0090.00013; It is great news for all members of the scheme. I would like to pay tribute to all the current and former trustee directors and members of the in-house team who have worked so hard to get the scheme into this enviable position, Green remarked.; 0
0090.00014; For telent, being the sponsor of a scheme many times larger than our business was not ideal. We can now look forward to focusing more of our investment in our already successful technology solutions business.; 0
0090.00015; Brian Duffin, Chairman of the Trustee Board, further stated: During its history, from its foundation up to this announcement, the GEC Plan has met its commitments to its members despite many changes and challenges.; 0
0090.00016; Over five years ago the Trustee decided that the best way to provide maximum security for our members in the long term would be to achieve buy-out. He went on: Thanks to support from our sponsor telent, and to an innovative investment strategy based on credit assets, we are now close to achieving our target.; 0
0090.00017; Our negotiations with Rothesay Life have been professional and constructive, and we will be working closely with them to take the final step to implement buy-out.; 0
0090.00018; We believe our members will receive good service from Rothesay Life in future as well as optimal security in the payment of their benefit entitlements.; 0
0090.00019; Martin Bird, Senior Partner & Head of Risk Settlement at Aon, added: We are extremely pleased to have supported the Trustee and telent achieve such a positive outcome for members.; 0
0090.00020; 2019 has been the busiest year on record for bulk annuities and the ability to stand out from the crowd continues to be the key component of capturing the best insurance pricing and terms.; 0
0090.00021; In this case, exemplary governance arrangements combined with a flexible and nimble project group proved invaluable in delivering such a successful outcome.; 0
0090.00022; And finally, John Baines, partner at Aon, said: We are very proud to have advised on the two largest bulk annuity transactions ever, both of which have occurred during 2019. This reflects the considerable evolution of the bulk annuity market since the introduction of Solvency II in 2016, with even the very largest schemes now being in a position to access buy-in and buyout structures.; 0
0090.00023; However, this does require extremely careful planning, strong governance and the ability to move at speed when the time is right.; 0

0091.00001; Getty  Nobody likes getting a tax bill in the mail. It's especially concerning when your tax bill is a bit higher than you anticipated.; 0
0091.00002; But what happens when it's hundreds of millions of dollars more than you were expecting? Just ask Donna Smith from Aurora, Colorado. Smith, a part-time worker at a local thrift store, got quite the surprise when she opened a tax bill from the Colorado Department of Revenue to find that the state claimed she owed $216,399,508 in taxes.; 0
0091.00003; Smith, who makes about $10 an hour, couldn't under the tax bill.; 0
0091.00004; To put the amount in perspective, it's nearly a quarter of the City of Aurora's entire budget for the year (report downloads as a PDF). Smith's returns are self-prepared, of sorts.; 0
0091.00005; Her mother, Diana Valencia, prepared Smith's tax return for 2018 and couldn't understand what happened.; 0
0091.00006; She told 9News that she went back to check the return, saying, I mean, I thought, 'Wow, was that an error on my part?' It was an error - but not on Valencia's part.; 0
0091.00007; Valencia used TurboTax to prepare the return. According to the Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR), the TurboTax software made an error tied to Smith's federal taxable income.; 0
0091.00008; A spokesperson from TurboTax confirmed the error, saying, For a small number of TurboTax online customers that filed their taxes between June 13-16, there was an issue that caused select fields on their tax return to be incorrectly transmitted during e-file. The issue was quickly fixed and we have been working directly with affected Colorado taxpayers and the Colorado State DOR to help resolve.; 0
0091.00009; If you were affected by the billing error and aren't currently working to resolve the matter, you should contact the Department of Revenue at (303) 866-4622 to reach a citizen's advocate.; 0
0091.00010; The Colorado DOR pegged the number of affected taxpayers at 44. That doesn't mean, however, that a few dozen taxpayers received multi-million dollar tax bills.; 0
0091.00011; According to Daniel Carr, Taxation Communications Manager at the Colorado DOR that number represents taxpayers who encountered the same glitch using TurboTax software during a three-day window in June of this year.; 0
0091.00012; What the taxpayer entered into TurboTax was correct, Carr said, explaining that an error in the TurboTax transfer reported incorrect amounts to the State of Colorado.; 0
0091.00013; The bills went out, explains the DOR, because [o]n our end it was simply data in data out and we could only process what we were given by TurboTax. We cannot determine the accurate amounts based on the information provided. Once the errors were discovered, however, the DOR worked with affected taxpayers.; 0
0091.00014; We have reached out to all of the taxpayers affected and are helping them resolve this issue, says Carr.; 0
0091.00015; That doesn't mean that the taxpayers don't have work to do.; 0
0091.00016; According to Carr, Taxpayers, in this case, who kept a copy of what they submitted are able to send us that copy and we will correct the error. Otherwise, they would have to amend their return. (For more information on how to file an amended federal income tax return, click here.); 0
0091.00017; Mistakes happen all of the time - just maybe not quite this big. No matter the size of the return, taxpayers can protect themselves, Carr advises, by always keeping a copy of filed returns.; 0
0091.00018; And if the bill seems out of place?; 0
0091.00019; Contact the Department of Revenue immediately to have it resolved.; 0

0091.00021; That's good advice for all taxpayers, no matter whether the bill is federal, state or local.; 0
0091.00022; In most cases - even when the bill is hundreds of millions of dollars - errors are totally fixable. But don't wait and hope that it goes away: it's important to reach out to the respective tax authorities to clear up any problems as soon as possible.; 0

The Administration plan already has liquidity regulation on the to-do list in light of recent developments, it could well join capital standards as a top-priority FHFA initiative.

0093.00001; The Board is also popularising techniques like low frequency tapping (including once-a -week tapping) and controlled upward tapping to further improve production and bringing down the cost. The Board anticipates an annual production of 7.5 lakh tonne natural rubber this fiscal.; 1
0093.00002; Fall in production last year is mainly attributed to high percentage of untapped area, low adoption level of modern techniques like rain-guarding and unscientific tapping methods.; 0
0093.00003; Timely rain-guarding has jacked up natural rubber output by 14,000 tonne in July, on an year-on-year basis, says Rubber Board.; 1
0093.00004; The production recorded in July was 60,000 tonne, while it was 46,000 tonne in July 2018. Confronted with a drastic reduction in production during the last few years, the Rubber Board companies procured rain-guard materials like polythene sheets and adhesive in bulk and distributed among small growers. As a result, nearly one lakh hactare of plantations were rain-guarded, more than the previous year.; 1
0093.00005; This is what was reflected in the increased production in July, says a Board release.; 0
0093.00006; The present level of low price has also contributed to this.; 0
0093.00007; For addressing this issue of unharvested plantations, the Rubber Board has recently introduced a programme, by which Board in association with its own companies and Rubber Producers' Societies would adopt such untapped holdings of small holding farmers and arrange for the maintenance, tapping, processing and marketing of produce. Societies and companies have so far adopted 1,600 ha plantations during the last few months.; 1
0093.00008; This arrangement has trimmed cost of production and bettered the quantity and quality of the rubber produced, says the Rubber Board, in its release.

0094.00001; A Convertible Bond (or convertible debenture) is a type of bond that can be converted into shares of stock in the issuing company, usually at some pre-announced ratio. It is a hybrid security with debt - and equity - like features. Although it typically has a low coupon rate, the holder is compensated with the ability to convert the bond to common stock, usually at a substantial premium to the stock's market value.; 0
0094.00002; From the issuer's perspective, the key benefit of raising money by selling convertible bonds is a reduced cash interest payment. However, in exchange for the benefit of reduced interest payments, the value of shareholder's equity is reduced due to the stock dilution expected when bondholders convert their bonds into new shares. Like any typical bond, Convertible Bonds have an issue size, issue date, maturity date, maturity value, face value and coupon.; 0
0094.00003; They also have the following additional features:  Conversion Price: The nominal price per share at which conversion takes place.; 0
0094.00004; Conversion Ratio: The number of shares each convertible bond converts into. It may be expressed per bond or on a per centum (per 100) basis.; 0
0094.00005; Parity (Conversion) Value: Equity price × Conversion ratio.; 0
0094.00006; Conversion Premium: Represents the divergence of the market value of the Convertible Bond compared to that of the parity value. Call Features: The ability of the issuer (on some bonds) to call a bond early for redemption, sometimes subject to certain share price performance.; 0
0094.00007; The intention is to encourage investors to convert early into equity (which has now become worth more than the bond's face value), by threatening repayment in cash for what is now a lower amount. Valuation  In theory, the market price of a Convertible Bond should never drop below its intrinsic value. The intrinsic value is simply the number of shares being converted at par value times the current market price of common shares.; 0
0094.00008; The 3 main stages of a Convertible Bondʼs behavior are:  In-the-Money Convertible Bonds: Conversion Price Is < Equity Price At-the-Money Convertible Bonds: Conversion Price Is = Equity Price Out-the-Money: Conversion Price Is > Equity Price.; 0
0094.00009; Uses for Investors  Convertible Bonds are usually issued offering a higher yield than obtainable on the shares into which the bonds convert. Convertible Bonds are safer than preferred or common shares for the investor. They provide asset protection, because the value of the Convertible Bond will only fall to the value of the bond floor.; 0
0094.00010; At the same time, Convertible Bonds can provide the possibility of high equity-like returns.; 0
0094.00011; Also, Convertible Bonds are usually less volatile than regular shares. The simultaneous purchase of Convertible Bonds and the short sale of the same issuer's common stock is a hedge fund strategy known as convertible arbitrage.; 0
0094.00012; The motivation for such a strategy is that the equity option embedded in a convertible bond is a source of cheap volatility, which can be exploited by convertible arbitrageurs. In limited circumstances, certain convertible bonds can be sold short, thus depressing the market value for a stock, and allowing the debt-holder to claim more stock with which to sell short.; 0

0095.00004; Not only is trade in services growing faster than trade in goods, but services are creating value far beyond what national accounts measure.; 0
0095.00005; Using alternative measures, we find that services already constitute more value in global trade than goods.; 0
0095.00006; In addition, all global value chains are becoming more knowledge-intensive.; 0
0095.00007; Low-skill labor is becoming less important as factor of production.; 0
0095.00008; Contrary to popular perception, only about 18 percent of global goods trade is now driven by labor-cost arbitrage. Three factors explain these changes: growing demand in China and the rest of the developing world, which enables these countries to consume more of what they produce the growth of more comprehensive domestic supply chains in those countries, which has reduced their reliance on imports of intermediate goods and the impact of new technologies.; 1
0095.00009; Globalization is in the midst of a transformation.; 0

0095.00013; Please email us at: McKinsey_Website_Accessibility@mckinsey.com  The 1990s and 2000s saw the expansion of complex value chains spanning the globe.; 0
0095.00014; But production networks are not immutable they continue to evolve. We observe five major shifts in global value chains over the past decade.; 0
0095.00015; 1 1. We refer primarily to nominal trade and GDP values reflecting current exchange rates in dollars. These values embody both quantity and prices. 1. Goods-producing value chains have grown less trade-intensive Trade rose rapidly within nearly all global value chains from 1995 to 2007.; 0
0095.00016; More recently, trade intensity (that is, the ratio of gross exports to gross output) in almost all goods-producing value chains has fallen. Trade is still growing in absolute terms, but the share of output moving across the world's borders has fallen from 28.1 percent in 2007 to 22.5 percent in 2017.; 0
0095.00017; Trade volume growth has also slowed.; 0
0095.00018; Between 1990 and 2007, global trade volumes grew 2.1 times faster than real GDP on average, but they have grown only 1.1 times faster than GDP since 2011. 2 2. Trade volumes are measured by trade in real prices.; 0
0095.00019; See World trade statistical review 2018, World Trade Organization, 2018. The decline in trade intensity is especially pronounced in the most complex and highly traded value chains (Exhibit 1).; 0
0095.00020; However, this trend does not signal that globalization is over. Rather, it reflects the development of China and other emerging economies, which are now consuming more of what they produce.; 0
0095.00021; Exhibit 1  2. Services play a growing and undervalued role in global value chains In 2017, gross trade in services totaled $5.1 trillion, a figure dwarfed by the $17.3 trillion global goods trade. But trade in services has grown more than 60 percent faster than goods trade over the past decade (Exhibit 2).; 1
0095.00022; Some subsectors, including telecom and IT services, business services, and intellectual property charges, are growing two to three times faster. Exhibit 2  We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.; 0
0095.00023; First, services create roughly one-third of the value that goes into traded manufactured goods. R&D, engineering, sales and marketing, finance, and human resources all enable goods to go to market.; 0
0095.00024; In addition, we find that imported services are substituting for domestic services in nearly all value chains. In the future, the distinction between goods and services will continue to blur as manufacturers increasingly introduce new types of leasing, subscription, and other as a service business models.; 0
0095.00025; Second, the intangible assets that multinational companies send to their affiliates around the world - including software, branding, design, operational processes, and other intellectual property developed at headquarters - represent tremendous value, but they often go unpriced and untracked unless captured as intellectual property charges. 3 3. Some trade in intangible assets is captured in trade statistics through intellectual property charges.; 0
0095.00026; These flows are sometimes driven by decisions of multinationals on where to put ownership of these assets based on tax considerations.; 0
0095.00027; See Thomas Tørsløv, Ludvig Wier, and Gabriel Zucman, The missing profits of nations, NBER working paper number 24701, June 2018, revised August 2018 and OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project, final report, OECD, May 2015. Years of R&D go into developing pharmaceuticals and smartphones, for example, while design and branding enable companies such as Nike and Adidas to charge a premium for their products. Finally, trade statistics do not track soaring cross-border flows of free digital services, including email, real-time mapping, video conferencing, and social media.; 0
0095.00028; Wikipedia, for instance, encompasses 40 million free articles in roughly 300 languages.; 0
0095.00029; Every day, users worldwide watch more than a billion hours of YouTube's video content for free, and billions of people use Facebook and WeChat every month. These services undoubtedly create value for users, even without a monetary price. We estimate that these three channels collectively produce up to $8.3 trillion in value annually - a figure that would increase overall trade flows by $4.0 trillion (or 20 percent) and reallocate another $4.3 trillion currently counted as part of the flow of goods to services.; 1
0095.00030; If viewed this way, trade in services is already more valuable than trade in goods.; 0
0095.00031; This perspective would substantially shift the trade balance for some countries, most notably the United States.; 0
0095.00032; This exercise is not meant to argue for redefining national trade statistics.; 0
0095.00033; It simply underscores the underappreciated role of services, which will be increasingly important for how companies and countries participate in global value chains and trade in the future.; 0
0095.00034; 3. Trade based on labor-cost arbitrage is declining in some value chains As global value chains expanded in the 1990s and early 2000s, many decisions about where to locate production were based on labor costs, particularly in industries producing labor-intensive goods and services. Yet counter to popular perceptions, today only 18 percent of goods trade is based on labor-cost arbitrage (defined as exports from countries whose GDP per capita is one-fifth or less than that of the importing country).; 0
0095.00035; 4 4.; 0
0095.00036; If we vary the ratio of GDP per capita of the exporter and importer from 2 to 10, we find that labor-cost arbitrage ranges from 5 to 30 percent of overall global trade.; 1
0095.00037; In other words, over 80 percent of today's global goods trade is not from a low-wage country to a high-wage country. Considerations other than low wages factor into company decisions about where to base production, such as access to skilled labor or natural resources, proximity to consumers, and the quality of infrastructure.; 0
0095.00038; Moreover, the share of trade based on labor-cost arbitrage has been declining in some value chains, especially labor-intensive goods manufacturing (where it dropped from 55 percent in 2005 to 43 percent in 2017). This mainly reflects rising wages in developing countries.; 1
0095.00039; In the future, however, automation and AI may amplify this trend, transforming labor-intensive manufacturing into capital-intensive manufacturing. This shift will have important implications for how low-income countries participate in global value chains.; 0
0095.00040; 4.; 0
0095.00041; Global value chains are growing more knowledge-intensive In all value chains, capitalized spending on R&D and intangible assets such as brands, software, and intellectual property (IP) is growing as a share of revenue. Overall, it rose from 5.4 percent of revenue in 2000 to 13.1 percent in 2016. This trend is most apparent in global innovations value chains.; 0
0095.00042; Companies in machinery and equipment spend 36 percent of revenue on R&D and intangibles, while those in pharmaceuticals and medical devices average 80 percent (Exhibit 3). The growing emphasis on knowledge and intangibles favors countries with highly skilled labor forces, strong innovation and R&D capabilities, and robust intellectual property protections.; 0
0095.00043; 5 5. Some trade in intangible assets is captured in trade statistics through intellectual property royalties, which are influenced by tax considerations. But the creation (rather than final ownership location) of intangible assets takes place in countries with talent, legal protections, and innovation ecosystems.; 0
0095.00044; Exhibit 3  We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. The share of value generated by the actual production of goods is declining (in part because offshoring has lowered the price of many goods).; 0
0095.00045; This trend is pronounced in pharmaceuticals and consumer electronics, which have seen the rise of virtual manufacturing companies that focus on developing goods and outsource actual production to contract manufacturers.; 0
0095.00046; 5. Value chains are becoming more regional and less global Until recently, long-haul trade crisscrossing oceans was becoming more prevalent as transportation and communication costs fell and as global value chains expanded into China and other developing countries.; 0
0095.00047; The share of trade in goods between countries within the same region (as opposed to trade between more far-flung buyers and sellers) declined from 51 percent in 2000 to 45 percent in 2012.; 0
0095.00048; That trend has begun to reverse in recent years.; 0
0095.00049; The intraregional share of global goods trade has increased by 2.7 percentage points since 2013, partially reflecting the rise of emerging-market consumption.; 1
0095.00050; This development is most noticeable for Asia and the EU-28 countries. Regionalization is most apparent in global innovations value chains, given their need to closely integrate many suppliers for just-in-time sequencing.; 0
0095.00051; This trend could accelerate in other value chains as well, as automation reduces the importance of labor costs and increases the importance of speed to market in company decisions about where to produce goods.; 0
0095.00052; We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. McKinsey estimates that emerging markets will consume almost two-thirds of the world's manufactured goods by 2025, with products such as cars, building products, and machinery leading the way.; 0
0095.00053; By 2030, developing countries are projected to account for more than half of all global consumption. These nations continue to deepen their participation in global flows of goods, services, finance, people, and data. The biggest wave of growth has been happening in China.; 0
0095.00054; Previous MGI research highlighted China's working-age population as one of the key global consumer segments by 2030, they are projected to account for 12 cents of every $1 of worldwide urban consumption.; 1
0095.00055; As it reaches the tipping point of having more millionaires than any other country in the world, China now represents roughly a third of the global market for luxury goods. In 2016, 40 percent more cars were sold in China than in all of Europe, and China also accounts for 40 percent of global textiles and apparel consumption.; 1
0095.00056; Would you like to learn more about McKinsey Global Institute? Visit our Productivity, Competitiveness & Growth page  As consumption grows, more of what gets made in China is now sold in China. This trend is contributing to the decline in trade intensity.; 0
0095.00057; Within the industry value chains we studied, China exported 17 percent of what it produced in 2007.; 0
0095.00058; By 2017, the share of exports was down to 9 percent. This is on a par with the share in the United States but is far lower than the shares in Germany (34 percent), South Korea (28 percent), and Japan (14 percent). This shift has been largely obscured because the country's output, imports, and exports have all been rising so dramatically in absolute terms.; 1
0095.00059; But overall, China is gradually rebalancing toward more domestic consumption. The rising middle class in other developing countries is also flexing new spending power. By 2030, the developing world outside of China is projected to account for 35 percent of global consumption, with countries including India, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines leading the way.; 0
0095.00060; In 2002, India, for example, exported 35 percent of its final output in apparel, but by 2017, that share had fallen by half, to 17 percent, as Indian consumers stepped up purchases.; 1
0095.00061; Growing demand in developing countries also offers an opportunity for exporters in advanced countries. Only 3 percent of exports from advanced economies went to China in 1995, but that share was up to 12 percent by 2017. The corresponding share going to other developing countries grew from 20 to 29 percent.; 0
0095.00062; In total, advanced economies' exports to developing countries grew from $1 trillion in 1995 to $4.2 trillion in 2017.; 0
0095.00063; In the automotive industry, Japan, Germany, and the United States send 42 percent of their car exports to China and the rest of the developing world. In knowledge-intensive services, 45 percent of all exports from advanced economies go to the developing world.; 0
0095.00064; The Asia - Pacific region is already a top strategic priority for many Western brands. We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website. Overall, it now accounts for 20 percent of global gross output, up from just 4 percent in 1995.; 0
0095.00065; In textiles and apparel, electrical machinery, and glass, cement, and ceramics, it now produces nearly half of global output. But as its economy has matured, China has moved beyond assembling imported inputs into final products. It now produces many intermediate goods and conducts more R&D in its own domestic supply chains.; 0
0095.00066; This is the second factor dampening global trade intensity in goods.; 0
0095.00067; In computers and electronics, for instance, Chinese companies are developing the kind of sophisticated smartphone chips that China once imported from advanced economies.; 0
0095.00068; Building more vertically integrated domestic industries enables China to capture more value added - and simultaneously bring jobs and economic development to its poorer inland provinces. Other developing countries are beginning to exhibit the same structural shifts seen in China, although they are at earlier stages.; 0
0095.00069; In textiles and apparel, for instance, production networks spanning multiple stages are consolidating within individual countries such as Vietnam, Bangladesh, Malaysia, India, and Indonesia. As a group, emerging Asia has become less reliant on imported intermediate inputs for the production of goods than the rest of the developing world (8.3 percent versus 15.1 percent in 2017).; 1
0095.00070; By contrast, in developing Europe, where economic growth has been slower, companies have continued to integrate into the supply chains of companies in Western Europe.; 0
0095.00071; The decline in trade intensity reflects growing industrial maturity in emerging economies. Over time, their production capabilities and consumption are gradually converging with those of advanced economies.; 0
0095.00072; Declining trade intensity in goods does not mean globalization is over rather, digital technologies and data flows are becoming the connective tissue of the global economy.; 0
0095.00073; We strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.; 0
0095.00074; From 2005 to 2017, the amount of cross-border bandwidth in use grew 148 times larger. A torrent of communications and content travels along these digital pathways - and some of this traffic reflects companies interacting with foreign operations, suppliers, and customers.; 1
0095.00075; Instant and low-cost digital communication has had one clear effect: lowering transaction costs and enabling more trade flows.; 0
0095.00076; But the impact of next-generation technologies on global flows of goods and services will not be as simple. The net impact is uncertain, but in some plausible scenarios, the next wave of technology could dampen global goods trade while continuing to fuel service flows. Digital platforms, logistics technologies, and data-processing advances will continue to reduce cross-border transaction costs and enable all types of flows In goods-producing value chains, logistics costs can be substantial.; 0
0095.00077; Companies often lose time and money to customs processing or delays in international payments.; 0
0095.00078; Three sets of technologies will continue to reduce these frictions in the years ahead. Digital platforms can bring together far-flung participants, making cross-border search and coordination more efficient.; 0
0095.00079; E-commerce marketplaces have already enabled significant cross-border flows by aggregating huge selections and making pricing and comparisons more transparent. Alibaba's AliResearch projects that cross-border B2C e-commerce sales will reach approximately $1 trillion by 2020.; 0
0095.00080; B2B e-commerce could be five or six times as large.; 0
0095.00081; While many of those transactions may substitute for traditional offline trade flows, e-commerce could still spur some $1.3 trillion to $2.1 trillion in incremental trade by 2030, boosting trade in manufactured goods by 6 to 10 percent.; 1
0095.00082; Continued rapid growth in small-parcel trade would present a challenge for customs processing, however.; 0
0095.00083; Logistics technologies also continue to improve.; 0
0095.00084; The IoT can make delivery services more efficient by tracking shipments in real time, and AI can route trucks based on current road conditions.; 0
0095.00085; Automated document processing can speed goods through customs.; 0
0095.00086; At ports, autonomous vehicles can unload, stack, and reload containers faster and with fewer errors.; 0
0095.00087; Blockchain shipping solutions can reduce transit times and speed payments. We calculate that new logistics technologies could reduce shipping and customs processing times by 16 to 28 percent. By removing some of the frictions that slow the movement of goods today, these technologies together could potentially boost overall trade by 6 to 11 percent by 2030. 6 6.; 1
0095.00088; The academic literature finds that a 1 percent reduction in trade costs can result in a 0.4 percent increase in trade flows.; 1
0095.00089; See Simeon Djankov, Caroline Freund, and Cong S. Pham, Trading on time, The Review of Economics and Statistics, 2010, Volume 92, Number 1.  Previous MGI research has found that roughly half of the tasks that workers are paid to do could technically be automated, suggesting a profound shift in the importance of capital versus labor across industries.; 0
0095.00090; The growing adoption of automation and advanced robotics in manufacturing makes proximity to consumer markets, access to resources, workforce skills, and infrastructure quality assume more importance as companies decide where to produce goods.; 0
0095.00091; Service processes can also be automated by artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual agents.; 0
0095.00092; The addition of machine learning to these virtual assistants means they can perform a growing range of tasks.; 0
0095.00093; Companies in advanced economies are already automating some customer support services rather than offshoring them. This could reduce the $160 billion global market for business process outsourcing (BPO), now one of the most heavily traded service sectors.; 1
0095.00094; Download Globalization in transition: The future of trade and value chains, the report on which this article is based (PDF - 3.7MB). Additive manufacturing (3-D printing) could also influence future trade flows. Most experts believe it will not replace mass production over the next decade its cost, speed, and quality are still limitations.; 0
0095.00095; But it is gaining traction for prototypes, replacement parts, toys, shoes, and medical devices. While 3-D printing could reduce trade in some specific products substantially, the drop is unlikely to amount to more than a few percentage points across overall trade in manufactured goods by 2030. In some cases, additive manufacturing could even spur trade by enabling customization.; 0
0095.00096; Overall, we estimate that automation, AI, and additive manufacturing could reduce global goods trade by up to 10 percent by 2030, as compared to the baseline.; 1
0095.00097; However, this reflects only the direct impact of these technologies on enabling production closer to end consumers in advanced economies.; 0
0095.00098; It is also possible that these technologies could lead to nearshoring and regionalization of trade instead of reshoring in advanced economies.; 0
0095.00099; Moreover, developing countries could adopt these technologies to improve productivity and retain production, thereby sustaining trade.; 0
0095.00100; Technology can transform some products and services, altering the content and volume of trade flows in the process.; 0
0095.00101; For example, McKinsey's automotive practice estimates that electric vehicles will make up some 17 percent of total car sales globally by 2030, up from 1 percent in 2017. This could reduce trade in vehicle parts by up to 10 percent (since EVs have many fewer moving parts than traditional models) while also dampening oil imports.; 1
0095.00102; The shift from physical to digital flows that started years ago with individual movies, albums, and games is now evolving once again with streaming and subscription models.; 0
0095.00103; Streaming now accounts for nearly 40 percent of global recorded music revenues. Cloud computing uses a similar pay-as-you-go or subscription model for storage and software, freeing users from making heavy capital investments in their own IT infrastructure.; 0
0095.00104; The advent of ultra-fast 5G wireless networks opens new possibilities for delivering services. Remote surgery, for example, may become more viable as networks transmit sharp images without any delays and robots respond more precisely to remote manipulation.; 0

0095.00106; Several imperatives stand out for global companies in this landscape:  Reassess where to compete along the value chain.; 0
0095.00107; Business leaders need to continuously monitor where value is moving in their industry and adapt accordingly.; 0
0095.00108; Some have narrowed their focus to R&D and distribution while outsourcing production. By contrast, many makers of consumer goods take a hyperlocal approach, with customized product portfolios for individual markets.; 0
0095.00109; Providers of global-local services, such as Airbnb and Uber, have recognized global brands but also extensive local operations that deliver in-person services.; 0
0095.00110; Network companies, most of which are knowledge-intensive service providers, create value through a geographically dispersed operating model and global reach.; 0
0095.00111; Regardless of the strategy, a key point is to maintain control, trust, and collaboration in all parts of the value chain. For some companies, this might mean bringing more operations in-house. Those that outsource need close supplier relationships and greater visibility into lower tiers of the supply chain.; 0
0095.00112; Consider how to capture value from services.; 0
0095.00113; Across multiple value chains (including manufacturing), more value is coming from services.; 0
0095.00114; Shifting to services can offer advantages: smoothing cyclicality in sales, providing higher-margin revenue streams, and enabling new sales or design ideas due to closer interaction with customers.; 0
0095.00115; At its extreme, entire business models shift from producing goods to delivering services. To make this shift successfully, companies need to gain insight into customer needs, invest in data and analytics, and develop the right subscription, per-use, or performance-based service contracts.; 0
0095.00116; Reconsider your operational footprint to reflect new risks.; 0
0095.00117; New automation technologies, changing factor costs, an expanding set of risks, and the increasing importance of speed to market in some industries are all driving localization in many goods-producing value chains. As a result, it may make sense to place production in or near key consumer markets around the world. Before investing, companies should consider the full risk-adjusted, end-to-end landed costs of location decisions - and today many do not account for all of the variables.; 0
0095.00118; Be flexible and resilient.; 0
0095.00119; Today companies face a more complex set of unknowns as the postwar world order that held for decades seems to be giving way. There is a real chance that tariffs and nontariff barriers will continue to rise, reversing decades of trade liberalization.; 0

0095.00121; This can take many forms, such as using versatile common platforms to share components across product lines and multiple plants.; 0
0095.00122; In purchasing, companies have achieved flexibility through price hedging, long-term contracting, shaping customer demand to enable using substitutes, and building redundancies into supply chains.; 0
0095.00123; Prioritize speed to market and proximity to customers. Companies in all industries now have real-time, granular sales and consumer behavior data at their disposal, but it takes manufacturing and distribution excellence to capitalize on these insights. Speed to market enables faster responses to what customers want and less product waste from forecasting errors.; 0
0095.00124; This does not necessarily require large-scale reshoring or full vertical integration in every major market.; 0
0095.00125; Companies can opt for postponement - that is, creating a largely standardized product at a distance and then finishing it with custom touches at a facility near the end market. Build closer supplier relationships. Arm's-length relationships with suppliers across the globe involve hidden risks and costs.; 0

0097.00001; The UP Government has decided to repeal a four-decade-old law that made the state exchequer pay the income tax of the state's Ministers.; 0
0097.00002; With this, the UP Ministers will now have to start paying their own income tax. The UP state government announced on September 13, 2019 that the provision will be scrapped.; 0
0097.00003; The announcement was made by UP Finance Minister Suresh Kumar Khanna, who said, UP chief ministers and all ministers will pay their own income tax. The Finance Minister revealed that the income tax bill of the Ministers was being paid through the state treasury but now the state government has decided to end the practice, per the directives of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.; 0
0097.00004; The move comes after the law received a lot of criticism in the media. Under the law, the state's chief minister and ministers weren't required to pay any income tax themselves.; 0
0097.00005; Instead, their share was paid by the state government under the Uttar Pradesh Ministers' Salaries, Allowances and Miscellaneous Act, 1981. UP Ministers' Salaries, Allowances and Miscellaneous Act, 1981  The 1981 law was enacted when Vishwanath Pratap Singh was the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh.; 0
0097.00006; Since then, the law has been in force throughout the terms of 19 CMs and about 1,000 ministers so far. The state of Uttar Pradesh has been helmed by Chief Ministers from across parties including Akhilesh Yadav, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Mayawati, Rajnath Singh, Kalyan Singh, ND Tiwari, Ram Prakash Gupta, Vir Bahadur Singh, Sripati Mishra and finally Yogi Adityanath himself.; 0
0097.00007; In the last fiscal year, the UP government paid Rs 86 lakh as the ministers' tax bill.; 1
0097.00008; After the matter was brought to light by a news report, many politicians claimed that they were not aware of the provision in the UP Act.; 0
0097.00009; A section of the 1981 Act states, The salary referred to in sub-sections (1) and (2) shall be exclusive of the tax payable in respect of such salary (including perquisites) under any law relating to income tax for the time being in force and such tax shall be borne by the state.; 0
0097.00010; Why was such a provision included in the Act?; 0
0097.00011; The law was put into place in 1981 to lessen the tax burden of poor Ministers.; 0
0097.00012; It was argued then that the state government should bear the burden of income tax as most of the ministers then belonged to poor backgrounds and had very low income.; 0
0097.00013; However, in recent years the state was led by Chief Ministers like BSP Chief Mayawati, who owns assets worth around Rs 111 crore and SP President president Akhilesh Yadav, who owns assets worth over Rs 37 crore with his wife Dimple Yadav, according to the affidavits submitted by the party chiefs to the Election Commission. Current UP CM Yogi Adityanath also reportedly owns assets worth Rs 95, 98,053, as per affidavit submitted by him for the Legislative Council elections in 2017.; 0

0098.00001; Blame Argentina's Economic Crisis on Repeated Mistakes By  Matthew C. Klein  illustration by Joel Arbaje  Text size  Argentina is in a crisis. Domestic spending fell 3.4% in 2018 and to drop 6.8% this year.; 0
0098.00002; The peso is down 70% against the U.S. dollar since the beginning of 2018.; 0
0098.00003; The drop in the currency has pushed yearly inflation above 50% and exploded the Argentine government's foreign-debt burden relative to national income. The government has responded by imposing capital controls and .; 0
0098.00004; This is precisely what President Mauricio Macri wanted to avoid when he went to the International Monetary Fund in the spring of 2018.; 0
0098.00005; The entire point of  - the largest ever made by the IMF - was to restore investor confidence in the country and attract enough new financing from the private sector to sustain spending on imports.; 0
0098.00006; That program failed, and now Argentine voters are looking to replace the center-right Macri with later this year.; 0
0098.00007; Macri came into office at the end of 2015 under difficult circumstances that have their roots in Argentina's . After years of stagnation and hyperinflation in the 1970s and 1980s, Argentina's apparent embrace of economic orthodoxy in the early 1990s made it a darling of international investors.; 0
0098.00008; From the beginning of 1993 through the end of 1999, dollar-denominated debt issued by the Argentine government and the Argentine private sector each .; 0
0098.00009; By 2003, the private sector's debts had been absorbed by the government, the banking system had been liquidated, the peso had depreciated by 70% against the dollar, and the government had been forced to default on most of its foreign obligations. Rising prices for Argentina's agricultural exports helped the country boom throughout the rest of the 2000s without the need for foreign financing - which was fortunate, since a few that had bought the country's defaulted debt at a discount yet demanded full repayment, with interest, limited the government's ability to tap international capital markets.; 0
0098.00010; Argentina steadily ran current account surpluses and accumulated reserves of hard currency until 2010. After that, however, and rising capital flight pushed the administration of Cristina Kirchner to impose capital controls and, crucially, to pay for imports by , known by the abbreviation BCRA.; 0
0098.00011; As the peso depreciated from 3.8 per dollar in the beginning of 2010 to 9.5 per dollar by the end of 2015, it generated substantial paper gains on the BCRA's portfolio of foreign assets relative to its peso-denominated liabilities.; 0
0098.00012; The government monetized those unrealized profits by having the BCRA print pesos and transfer the difference to the federal budget.; 0
0098.00013; After Macri took over, the BCRA maintained the same basic practice, except that it issued peso-denominated securities instead of cash. Macri started his term by lifting the capital controls and settling with the holdout creditors. At the same time, he wanted to capitalize on a change in sentiment by borrowing as much as possible at relatively low interest rates to boost the economy and help his chances for re-election at the end of October.; 0
0098.00014; Between December 2015 and March 2018, Argentine savers moved more than $41 billion out of the country and foreign investors bought in new Argentine bonds. Debts owed to foreigners rose by more than 80% in just over two years, funding an import boom.; 0
0098.00015; Borrowing that much in dollars was inherently risky, but the situation was compounded by the mismatch between the BCRA's need for continued peso depreciation and the government's inability to service its debts without continued inflows of dollars and a stable exchange rate. By the middle of 2018, domestic capital flight had accelerated and foreign inflows had switched to outflows, hence the call to the IMF.; 0
0098.00016; Instead of demanding that Argentina restructure its unpayable debts at the expense of private creditors, limit financial outflows, and fix the dysfunctional relationship between the government and the BCRA, the IMF decided to blame Argentina's troubles on a lack of confidence and a drought.; 0
0098.00017; As it did in Greece , the IMF ignored its and lent good money after bad.; 0
0098.00018; The IMF's initial expectation was that foreign investors would keep lending more and more to the Argentine government so that the country's external indebtedness would continue to rise.; 0
0098.00019; The IMF's does not bother to estimate foreign demand for government debt and instead assumes external liabilities will be roughly flat in dollar terms until 2024. So far, the influx of official loans has mostly offset the collapse in bond financing.; 0
0098.00020; But nothing else has gone according to plan. For one thing, Argentine savers have moved more money out of the country than the IMF has moved in. The BCRA has had to use most of the loan proceeds simply to maintain its portfolio of foreign reserves.; 0
0098.00021; That is far worse than what was initially anticipated in the IMF's adverse scenario. When the loan was agreed to last summer, the IMF's staff economists had expected Argentine exports to rise by 23% between 2017 and 2019 in dollar terms.; 0
0098.00022; So far this year, export earnings . More preposterously, the IMF had expected Argentinian export revenues to eventually rise more than 50% by 2023.; 0
0098.00023; This was necessary to make the country's massive external debt load sustainable and justify continued foreign demand for Argentine assets. Tellingly, this was also the same mistake made in Greece: The IMF expected Greek exports of goods and services to rise by more than 40% between 2010 and 2015.; 0
0098.00024; Argentina's current troubles can be blamed on the twin mistakes of the government and the IMF.; 0
0098.00025; At this point, the best thing the IMF could do is help Argentina reduce its massive debt load while providing temporary financing to smooth the inevitable cuts in imports.; 0
0098.00026; Unfortunately for millions of Argentines, neither the government nor the IMF seems to have learned from recent experience.; 0

0099.00001; The misery continued in Wednesday trading, with the shares slipping a further 11.3% to 4.1p by early afternoon. Sirius' dramatic reversal of fortune has blown a rather large hole in the account balance of dozens of investors, both large and small, with the future of the project now on hold as the firm considers its options.; 0
0099.00002; Some of the biggest losers of Sirius' share price implosion are its major shareholders. These include FTSE 250 firm Jupiter Fund Management PLC (LON:JUP), one of the company's long term backers with a stake of around 4.7% which until Tuesday morning was worth around £32.9mln, it is now closer to £13.1mln. It is a similar story for LA-based Capital Group Companies, one of the world's oldest and largest investment managers, whose 6.5% stake in Sirius went from £45.5mln at Monday's close to £18.2mln by Tuesday afternoon.; 1
0099.00003; WATCH: Sirius Minerals: Proactive Research analyst not surprised gargantuan financing failed Famous institutions such as Citigroup have also been hit with their 5% stake dropping to £14mln from £35mln and there have also been headaches in the Middle East as the state-backed Qatar Investment Authority saw the value of its 3.3% holding tumble to £9.2mln from £23.1mln.; 0
0099.00004; Lastly, there are the 85,000 retail shareholders, some of whom live close to the mine site in North Yorkshire and had invested in a bid to boost the fortunes of the local economy.; 1
0099.00005; Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said that given the current situation it was highly likely that Sirius investors would suffer further as the firm may have to raise more money or sell a chunk of its business to a new strategic investor on unfavourable terms due to its now desperate need for cash.; 0
0099.00006; While the bulletin boards have been filled with tales of woe, some on the market will be rubbing their hands with glee at Sirius' plunge.; 0
0099.00007; One such character will be hedge fund billionaire and America's 45th richest man Kenneth Griffin, whose Citadel asset management firm held a 0.9% short position on Sirius as of 9 September.; 0
0099.00008; Another prominent shorter is BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, with a 0.7% position. READ: Sirius Minerals financing falls apart amid Brexit bond turmoil, Boris Johnson's govt refuses funding support Shorting is when an investor borrows shares in a company and sells them in the hope the price will decrease, allowing them to buy back the shares for a lower price and pocket the difference.; 0
0099.00009; Sirius' struggles could also prove positive for its competitors in the potash space, particularly US-listed firms such as Nutrien Ltd (NYSE:NTR) and The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS). A toss-up for the UK Government Finally, Boris Johnson's government could be one of the biggest losers in the Sirius saga, with its refusal to act as a guarantor for the project causing widespread political fallout.; 0
0099.00010; A prominent critic is Anna Turley, the Labour MP for nearby Redcar, who in a statement following the news branded the government's refusal to step in as an absolute disgrace as the project would provide 1,200 jobs across Teeside and North Yorkshire.; 0
0099.00011; Turley also lambasted the government's Northern Powerhouse strategy, which aims to boost economic growth in Northern England, saying its commitment to the proposal was ringing hollow in the wake of Sirius' troubles. The government's inaction may also have hit a raw nerve given the previous administration headed by Theresa May had supported government-backed financing for the project before she exited Downing Street in July.; 0
0099.00012; However, one upshot for the Treasury will be that it will not have to immediately stump up hundreds of millions of pounds, particularly with no-deal Brexit plans already sucking up large amounts of taxpayer cash, which at current estimates stands at over £6bn.

0100.00001; HOUSTON  -  Fixing the damage done by the drone attack on the Saudi oil processing plant may be the easy part. The hard part will be calming energy markets, where oil prices have jumped faster than at any time in over a decade.; 0
0100.00002; The attack on Saudi Arabia's Abqaiq plant, which accounts for 5 percent of global oil supplies, and a nearby facility took 5.7 million barrels a day of production off line for at least a few days.; 1
0100.00003; It also revealed the significant danger that drones pose to the Persian Gulf's sprawling processing plants, pipelines and refineries. The psyche has been altered, said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for Oil Price Information Service. Now you have the thought, 'What if the other shoe drops and we have a wider conflict.'; 0
0100.00004; For years, American and Saudi security analysts have worried about the Abqaiq plant, which removes sulfur impurities and makes crude oil less volatile so it can be safely exported on tankers. Without Abqaiq, much of the oil that Saudi Arabia produces at its giant Ghawar and Shaybah oil fields would have nowhere to go.; 0
0100.00005; The facility has a heavily guarded perimeter, which was substantially fortified after several cars carrying Al Qaeda suicide bombers attacked it in 2006. Guards stopped those attackers before they reached the complex's gates.; 0
0100.00006; But those security measures were not sufficient to stop the sophisticated weekend attack by multiple drones that crippled critical components of the facility. While a production shortfall from an attack on one pipeline or refinery can often be replaced by others, it is not easy to make up for the loss of the processing capacity of Abqaiq, the largest facility of its kind in the world.; 0
0100.00007; The fires were quickly put out, and Saudi repairs have already begun. But a return to full capacity may take months, energy experts said.; 0
0100.00008; This changes the oil markets psychologically for a couple of years for sure now that everything is shown to be vulnerable, said Dragan Vuckovic, president of Mediterranean International, an oil service company that works in Egypt and Iraq. One drone can hit a refinery or an oil field installation and that causes fires, destruction and stops all production.; 0
0100.00009; It means less oil on the market and higher oil prices. Oil futures shot up 20 percent when trading began in Asia on Monday morning before falling back a little later in the day.; 0
0100.00010; It was still the biggest one-day oil price shock since Hurricane Katrina shut down production at Gulf Coast refineries and offshore oil fields in 2005, Mr. Kloza said. The United States benchmark oil contract settled up $8.05 a barrel, or nearly 15 percent, to $62.90 on Monday afternoon.; 0
0100.00011; That is still about 7 percent below the price of a year ago. The global Brent oil benchmark also rose nearly 15 percent. Prices might have jumped even more had global oil supplies not been bountiful, analysts said.; 0
0100.00012; It also helps that the global economy is slowing, oil production is surging in the United States and many industrialized nations have large strategic oil reserves.; 0
0100.00013; The world has an estimated 90-day supply of oil available, and the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq have spare production capacity.; 0
0100.00014; New oil pipelines between West Texas and the Gulf Coast are near completion and will soon boost American exports to countries like South Korea and Japan that depend on Saudi crude.; 0
0100.00015; And producers that have been dropping rigs in recent months will likely drill more if prices stay elevated.; 0
0100.00016; Over the weekend, Saudi Arabia attempted to quicken the pace of tanker traffic from its ports to cushion the market shock. Rob Thummel, managing director at Tortoise Advisors, a firm that makes energy investments, predicted a price hike of between 10 and 20 percent until there is a complete assessment of the damage at the Saudi plant.; 0
0100.00017; In the long term, oil prices will likely add a geopolitical risk premium of at least $5 to $10 into the price until the odds of another strike are reduced, he said.; 0
0100.00018; Mr. Thummel projected that oil prices in the United States will settle at between $60 and $70 a barrel, which would lead to a roughly 25 cent increase in the retail price of gasoline.; 1
0100.00019; Americans burn about 400 million gallons of gasoline a day, so a 25 cent increase would cost consumers about $100 million a day.; 1
0100.00020; The national average price for regular gasoline on Monday was $2.56 a gallon, 29 cents below a year ago.; 0
0100.00021; Experts say the drop in gas prices over the last year afforded consumers some extra disposable income  -  something that is now likely to disappear. For many years, analysts believed that higher oil prices always hurt the American economy.; 0
0100.00022; But in recent years, that has changed.; 0
0100.00023; States like Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico, North Dakota and Colorado benefit when oil prices move up.; 0
0100.00024; Higher prices also help smaller oil companies and oil service companies, which have been laying off workers and struggling to pay debts in recent months. The share prices of several oil and gas company stocks, including Carrizo Oil & Gas, Chesapeake Energy, Apache and Hess, jumped by more than 10 percent on Monday.; 1
0100.00025; Higher oil prices could also reduce the trade deficit now that the United States is a major exporter. Other potential beneficiaries are steel companies and other manufacturers that supply pipes and other equipment to the energy industry.; 0
0100.00026; The ethanol industry will also benefit, Mr. Kloza said, because biofuels will become more attractive relative to oil. That should help corn farmers in the Midwest. That said, higher oil prices could further slow an already weak global economy, especially if the attack on Abqaiq leads to more violence in the Middle East.; 0
0100.00027; If a full-fledged war between Iran and Saudi Arabia breaks out, there would be no limit to how high prices could go, said Jay Hatfield, portfolio manager at InfraCap MLP, an exchange-traded fund that invests in oil pipelines. Even without a war, global supplies could get tighter.; 0
0100.00028; Pipelines in the United States remain congested, which will likely reduce daily releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve should the Trump administration decide to tap that resource.; 0
0100.00029; Other countries like Japan and Korea tend to be reluctant to tap their oil reserves, which they prefer to turn to only during full-blown crises. President Trump said on Sunday that he has authorized a release of oil from the strategic reserve if needed, but his energy secretary, Rick Perry, told CNBC on Monday that the administration has not made a decision about tapping the reserve.; 0

0101.00001; Tue, 07 May 2019 08:13:59 BST  Case Study  12 April 2019  Viola Samisoni, a cookstoves producer from Dedza, Malawi.; 0
0101.00002; Photo credit: Irish Aid Malawi  Viola Samisoni is from Kanyera village, Dedza district in Malawi.; 0
0101.00003; A mother of five, Viola's annual income of €120 is derived primarily from the sale of rain-fed crops grown on her plot of 2.5 acres.; 1
0101.00004; Her village, Kanyera, is typical of rural communities in Malawi, at risk from - but adapting to - the full impact of climate change.; 0
0101.00005; The effects of global climate change are real and current here, with erratic rainfall patterns making it more and more difficult to farm.; 0
0101.00006; Viola, like 99% of Malawi's rural population, does not have access to electricity, and is entirely dependent on biomass (wood) for her daily cooking requirement. The dependence on biomass for fuel has contributed to rapid deforestation with over reduction in forest cover of more than 30% in less than four decades  -  one of the highest rates of deforestation in Africa. Against this backdrop, in 2013 Malawi committed to an ambitious target of getting two million energy efficient cookstoves into use in households across the country, to replace the traditional open stone fire.; 1
0101.00007; Irish Aid has championed this agenda via the National Cookstove Steering committee and by supporting organisations such as NASFAM and UP to train and equip cookstove production groups, and to facilitate largescale sales and distributions.; 0
0101.00008; Locally made, low-cost, low-tech interventions such as clean cookstoves represent an important adaptation and mitigation strategy for women like Viola. Replacing the traditional three-stone open fire with a more energy efficient cookstove has well documented benefits reducing fuel wood usage, economising on household labour, reducing the real risk of gender based violence for women and girls collecting fire wood, as well as health dividends from reduced smoke inhalation and burns.; 0
0101.00009; The manufacture and sale of the stoves for Viola and the other members of her cookstove production group Tinyanjane ('Lets unite') offers a small, occasional, but nonetheless valuable source of income.; 0
0101.00010; And it doesn't need to stop there, stove production and use is just one of a number of Viola's adaptation strategies in response to climate change that combine development dividends with reduced emissions.; 0
0101.00011; A community-led catchment management scheme has resulted in the planting of more 3,500 trees around Kanyera village over the course of the past decade.; 1
0101.00012; By-laws have been developed to protect the local woodland, and since the introduction of the cleaner cookstoves there has been a dramatic reduction in the rate of tree felling.‌   Previous Item | Next Item ; 0

0105.00001; Long Ideas | Financials | Germany  |  About: Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (DB)  by: Labutes IR  Labutes IR  Long/short equity, mutual fund manager, foreign companies, banks  Summary  Deutsche Bank's new strategy seems to be credible and should lead to a more sustainable bank in the long term. Significant restructuring charges will affect earnings in 2019 and 2020, thus a re-rating based on improving profitability is not expected during this period.; 0
0105.00002; Nevertheless, its depressed valuation makes downside quite limited, and Deutsche Bank is a deep value play right now for long-term investors. As I've discussed previously, Deutsche Bank (DB) has fixed many of its issues in the recent past, but its business strategy needed to change for the bank to be profitable in a sustainable way.; 0
0105.00003; The bank's management acknowledged this reality and has recently revealed a new strategy, aiming to change Deutsche Bank's business profile in the next few years.; 0
0105.00004; If executed well, the bank can improve a lot its profitability, and its current depressed valuation makes downside limited, while upside can be significant if the bank reaches its financial targets in the coming years. Deutsche Bank has been one of the global banks most affected by the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and the overcapacity in the investment banking industry worldwide.; 0
0105.00005; Moreover, due to past misconduct, Deutsche Bank's earnings were negatively impacted for several years from high litigation costs, leading to negative earnings in some years or very low levels of profitability in others.; 0
0105.00006; Deutsche Bank has resolved most of its litigation cases until 2017 and performed a capital increase to regain investor and customer confidence, but its financial performance continued to be quite poor compared to most of its peers.; 0
0105.00007; Therefore, a couple of months ago, the bank announced a new group strategy focused on fixing the bank's woes in the next 3-5 years.; 0
0105.00008; The main goal is to improve the bank's profitability, measured by its return on equity ratio (ROE), a performance indicator that has been below its cost of capital since 2009, which means that Deutsche Bank has destroyed shareholder value nearly for a decade.; 0
0105.00009; To improve its business profile, Deutsche Bank has decided to focus on businesses where it has some competitive advantage and exit operations that had losses or low profitability.; 0
0105.00010; This means that Deutsche Bank will increase its focus on the corporate bank, while, on the other hand, it will downsize its investment banking activities through the exit of equities sales & trading and resize fixed income operations.; 0
0105.00011; The goal is to have a smaller bank, but with a more sustainable business model less dependent on capital markets in the long term. To achieve this, Deutsche Bank has decided to create a new Capital Release Unit (CRU), to where it transferred some €74 billion ($81 billion) of risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and €288 billion ($316 billion) of leverage exposure.; 1
0105.00012; This will improve the bank's revenue profile of the core businesses, being less exposed to volatile activities as seen in the next graph.; 0
0105.00013; Source: Deutsche Bank  Its goal is to eliminate these assets from the bank's balance sheet in a few years, which is expected to have restructuring costs of more than about €2 billion ($2.2 billion) in the next three years plus accounting charges (non-cash expenses) and liberate some €5 billion ($5.5 billion) of capital until 2022.; 1
0105.00014; As the bank will cut more than 20% of its RWAs and leverage exposure, it does not expect to increase capital during the next few years, something that seems to be achievable given the significant reduction in total assets.; 0
0105.00015; Other key financial targets are for core revenue of €25 billion ($27.5 billion) in 2022, adjusted costs of €17 billion ($18.7 billion) and a return on tangible equity (RoTE) of 8%. This means that Deutsche Bank expects to increase revenue at about 2% per year during 2019-2022, reduce costs by 7% per year and increase its profitability (RoTE) from only 0.5% to a level much closer to its cost of capital.; 1
0105.00016; This strategy makes sense and targets seem to be conservative, but execution risk is high and the bank's track record on previous restructuring programs is very weak. This means that Deutsche Bank needs to rapidly show good execution of its plan to gain credibility from investors, with a rapid reduction of its CRU assets the major milestone to achieve in the short term.; 0
0105.00017; Indeed, Deutsche Bank expects the majority of the CRU run-down to happen in the next 18 months, showing that it wants to rapidly change the group's balance sheet and revenue profile, something that is key for a change of investor sentiment towards the bank. Source: Deutsche Bank  Regarding its capitalization, Deutsche Bank currently has sound capital metrics that enable it to absorb capital hits without the need to raise new capital.; 0
0105.00018; In the short term, the restructuring program is expected to reduce Deutsche Bank's fully loaded core tier 1 (FL CET1) ratio to a level of about 13%, which is still an adequate level.; 1
0105.00019; Going forward, due to its less risky business profile, it targets a FL CET1 ratio of at least 12.5% compared to 13% previously.; 1
0105.00020; Given this capital target, the bank only expects to have an excess capital position in 2021 and, therefore, has suspended dividend payments in the coming years.; 0
0105.00021; Source: Deutsche Bank. It expects to return capital to shareholders again starting in 2022, but this depends on sound execution of its business plan.; 0
0105.00022; The market seems to be giving the bank the benefit of the doubt, given that current consensus expectations expect a small dividend payment in 2020, contrary to the bank's own dividend guidance.; 0
0105.00023; Beyond its new strategy, Deutsche Bank also has announced recently earnings related to Q2 2019, maintaining a relatively weak performance, especially at its investment banking unit. Its revenues during the first six months of 2019 declined significantly (-5% year-on-year), while revenues in the investment banking dropped by 12% year-on-year (yoy), being the major drag to Deutsche Bank's top-line in the most recent quarters.; 0
0105.00024; Equities and fixed-income reported an 18% decline in revenues compared to the same period of last year, showing that the bank's strategy of reducing its exposure to investment banking is the right one, after several years trying to defend its position in this industry.; 1
0105.00025; Source: Deutsche Bank  Other units performed better reporting slightly higher revenues compared to H1 2018, which bodes well for the future as the bank decreases its reliance on more market-sensitive activities.; 0
0105.00026; Nevertheless, despite strong capital markets in the past few months, Deutsche Bank's asset management unit increased revenues by only 1% yoy, which is not an impressive achievement compared to some of its peers. Even though asset management is an area where the bank has better growth prospects over the long term, this relatively weak performance shows that Deutsche Bank needs to regain customer confidence to grow its business and achieve revenue growth in core activities.; 0
0105.00027; Regarding costs, Deutsche Bank's cost-to-income ratio was above 100% in the first half of 2019 (including the CRU unit), a terrible level that means Deutsche Bank was not able to make an operating profit during this period.; 0
0105.00028; This happens because revenue erosion is faster than cost reductions, showing that stabilizing revenues is critical for the bank to improve its financial profile.; 0
0105.00029; Considering only the 'core bank', Deutsche Bank's cost-to-income ratio was 90%, still a very high level and one of the worst in the European banking sector.; 0
0105.00030; The bank targets a cost-to-income ratio of 70% by 2022 by cutting some €6 billion ($6.6 billion) in annual expenses and some revenue growth, which should be the key to reach its profitability target in the medium term.; 1
0105.00031; Due to one-off deferred tax assets (DTA) impairment of €2 billion ($2.2 billion) in the past quarter, Deutsche Bank's reported bottom-line in Q2 2019 was negative in more than €3.1 billion ($3.4 billion).; 1
0105.00032; This means that the bank will report again an annual loss this year due to restructuring costs, but even excluding extraordinary items the profit in the last quarter was quite low which is a bad signal for the bottom-line in the next year.; 0
0105.00033; Despite the significant reported loss, Deutsche Bank's capital hit was only 32 basis points and its FL CET1 ratio was 13.4% at the end of June, still a good capitalization level within the European banking system.; 0
0105.00034; Source: Deutsche Bank.; 0
0105.00035; Going forward, Deutsche Bank is expected to report significant restructuring charges in the next few quarters due to its rundown of assets in the CRU unit and, according to analysts' estimates, only return to report a meaningful profit in 2021.; 0
0105.00036; However, there is a significant execution risk regarding its business plan and the macroeconomic environment has deteriorated further in the past two months due to increasing expectations of lower rates for longer in Europe, which has prompted the bank to slightly change its guidance of revenue target in 2022 from about €25 billion, to €24-25 billion.; 1
0105.00037; Given that Deutsche Bank's strategy was presented only two months ago, this is not a good signal and doesn't help investors and customers regain confidence in the bank rapidly.; 0
0105.00038; Deutsche Bank's new strategy seems to make sense and will change significantly the bank's financial profile, which should lead to a much more sustainable and stronger banks in a few years. Then, it may pursue a different strategy, namely grow through acquisitions in the asset/wealth management industry.; 0
0105.00039; After several years of very weak share price performance, Deutsche Bank currently trades at a very low valuation of only 0.27x book value.; 0
0105.00040; This means that downside seems limited right now and upside can be significant if the bank executes well its new strategy.; 0
0105.00041; However, this will take time, and Deutsche Bank can be a good deep value play for long-term investors, but for more risk-averse investors, I suggest to remain on the sidelines for the time being.; 0

0106.00001; Strategist uses 'The Simpsons' to explain what this repo stuff is all about Facebook  Twitter  Google+  Pinterest  WhatsApp  You've seen the headlines:  Bloomberg: '…  The Wall Street Journal: …  Business Insider:  Some of the explainers are pretty wonky, so you're forgiven if you can't quite wrap your brain around what it all means. Basically, the repo market is like plumbing in the U.S. financial system, making sure banks have enough cash to meet their short-term needs.; 0
0106.00002; A repo trade happens when a firm offers high-quality securities, like U.S. Treasurys   UST, +0.80%   , as collateral to raise cash and finance their trading and lending activities overnight.; 0
0106.00003; The borrowers the next day pay back those loans, with interest  -  essentially, they repo the bonds. But when there's fear in the market or when there's not enough cash or sufficient reserves in the system, the repo rate can explode like it did this week, .; 0
0106.00004; If you're still confused, Guy LeBas, Janney Capital Management's fixed income strategist, is here to explain, with the help of The Simpsons:  Repo (repurchase or reverse repurchase agreement) is a common way to finance a bond. Essentially, an owner buys a bond and then borrows, say 95% of the value of that bond, posting the bond as collateral.; 0

0107.00001; The US tops 37.9 GW of large scale solar That record figure of utility scale PV was under contract at the end of June with 8.7 GWdc under construction. However, installation levels fell slightly, year-over-year.; 0
0107.00002; Christian Roselund  Household solar continued its recovery in the U.S. during the second quarter. Image: LEC Leutenegger Energie Control  From pv magazine USA.; 0
0107.00003; We've been expecting this for some time. At the beginning of the year, pv magazine reported an unprecedented volume of solar projects in the interconnection queues of six grid operators, totaling 139 GWac.; 0
0107.00004; We'd missed one (the Southwest Power Pool), which would have brought the total to 154 GWac.; 0
0107.00005; Now it appears those projects and others in the south and mountain west  -  areas which do not have independent grid operators  -  are beginning to move forward with power contracts and even steel in the ground. According to the latest U.S. Solar Market Insight report by analyst Wood Mackenzie and the Solar Energy Industries Association, at the end of the second quarter the volume of large scale solar projects under contract across the United States had ballooned to 37.9 GWdc, with 8.7 GWdc of those under construction.; 0
0107.00006; That is in part the result of 11.2 GWdc of new projects that won contracts in the first half of the year.; 0
0107.00007; Those numbers are supported by data from the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA).; 0
0107.00008; The EIA reported 1.4 GW of PV module shipments in June and 1.1 GW in July  -  the highest monthly volumes seen since November, when developers were frantically importing to avoid the pending Section 201 tariffs.; 1
0107.00009; A slow Q2  Second quarter installation figures were unimpressive, however.; 0
0107.00010; The United States only installed 2.1 GWdc of solar during the period, for a 7% year-over-year contraction.; 0
0107.00011; A sectoral breakdown showed the figures were highly uneven. The non-residential sector  -  where Wood Mackenzie lumps together commercial and industrial, non-profit, government and even community solar arrays  -  is set to fall for the second straight year.; 0
0107.00012; Only 426 MWdc was installed during the second quarter, less than the amount added from January to March. Wood Mackenzie blamed policy changes in California, Massachusetts and Minnesota.; 1
0107.00013; However the utility scale sector was relatively strong with more than 1 GW installed in the second quarter. Residential solar installations too, continued to recover after the crash of 2016 and 2017.; 0
0107.00014; Household volumes were up a cheerful 8% year-over-year despite continued contraction at Tesla/SolarCity, which at its height was responsible for a third of the market. Geographically, there were no big surprises.; 0
0107.00015; California led again with Florida second  -  by a wide margin  -  and North Carolina third.; 0
0107.00016; Later in the year, however, we can expect higher installation volumes in Florida and perhaps Texas, where project development is booming.; 0
0107.00017; Looking ahead  Several of the projects making up that wave of utility scale solar are not expected to be completed this year.; 0
0107.00018; Although the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) falls from 30% to 26% next year, if contractors begin construction this year they can claim the full 30%.; 0
0107.00019; Wood Mackenzie is forecasting 12.6 GWdc of solar will be installed this year and has reduced its utility scale forecast due to completion of many projects being pushed out to next year or later.; 1
0107.00020; However, the analyst has raised its 2020 and 2021 forecasts, with 17.6 GW expected in 2021 after almost the same volume next year, as projects come online for the final hurrah of the 30% ITC. Wood Mackenzie is expecting a slight dip again in 2022 but the further out projections get, the more uncertain they become.; 0

0116.00001; Search Capital gains tax We consider the taxation of capital gains and outline the reliefs  available.; 0
0116.00002; If you live in the Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire area we, at Knox & Eames, can provide  taxation advice to ensure that maximum opportunity is taken of the reliefs  available for capital gains tax.; 0
0116.00003; A capital gain arises when certain capital (or 'chargeable') assets are sold at a profit. The gain is the sale proceeds (net of selling costs) less the purchase price (including acquisition costs).; 0
0116.00004; What are the main features of the current system?; 0
0116.00005; Capital gains tax (CGT) is charged at the rate of 10% on gains (including any held over gains coming into charge) where net total taxable gains and income is below the income tax basic rate band threshold. Gains or any parts of gains above the basic rate band are charged at 20% with a few exceptions which are considered in the 'Exceptions to the CGT rates section' below. Entrepreneurs' Relief (ER) or Investors' Relief (IR) may be available on certain business disposals.; 0
0116.00006; Entrepreneurs' Relief (ER) ER may be available for certain business disposals and has the effect of charging the first £10 million of gains qualifying for the relief at an effective rate of 10%. The relief will be available to individuals on the disposal of: the whole, or part, of a trading business that is carried on by the individual, either alone or in partnership shares in an individual's 'personal company' assets used by a business or a company which has ceased within the last three years Where an individual makes a qualifying business disposal, relief may also be available on an 'associated disposal'.; 0
0116.00007; An 'associated disposal' is a disposal of an asset: used in a qualifying company or group of companies of the individual or used in a partnership, where the individual is a partner. Restrictions on obtaining the relief on an 'associated disposal' are likely to apply in certain specific situations. This includes the common situation where a property is in personal ownership but is used in an unquoted company or partnership trade in return for a rent.; 0
0116.00008; Under ER the availability of relief is restricted where rent is paid.; 0
0116.00009; Ownership period of two years Ownership conditions apply throughout the period up to the date of disposal. For disposals on or after 6 April 2019, the necessary qualifying period of ownership is two years.; 0
0116.00010; The 5% rule for company shareholders To qualify for ER, the company needs to be an individual's 'personal company' where the individual must: be a company employee or office holder hold at least 5% of the company's ordinary share capital and be able to exercise at least 5% of the voting rights.; 1
0116.00011; For disposals on or after 29 October 2018, they must also satisfy one of the following tests: a distribution test  -  an individual is entitled to at least 5% of the company's profit available for distribution to equity holders and 5% of the assets available for distribution to equity holders in a winding up or a proceeds test  -  an individual is entitled to at least 5% of the proceeds in the event of a disposal of the whole of the ordinary share capital of the company.; 0
0116.00012; Dilution From 6 April 2019 those shareholders whose holding in their company is reduced below the normal 5% qualifying level as a result of raising funds for commercial purposes by means of an issue of new shares may still obtain ER.; 1
0116.00013; An election can be made which allows shareholders to crystallise a gain on their shares before the dilution occurs. This would be achieved by treating the shareholding as having been sold and immediately re-purchased at the prevailing market value. The election will have to be made in their tax return for the year in which the dilution takes place.; 0
0116.00014; The shareholder may also elect to defer the accrued gain until their shares are actually disposed of. Careful planning will be required with ER but if you would like to discuss ER in detail and how it might affect your business, please do get in touch.; 0
0116.00015; Investors' Relief (IR) ER has been extended to external investors (other than certain employees or officers of the company) in unlisted trading companies.; 0
0116.00016; To qualify for the 10% CGT rate under 'investors' relief' the following conditions need to be met: shares must be newly issued and subscribed for by the individual for new consideration be in an unlisted trading company, or an unlisted holding company of a trading group have been issued by the company on or after 17 March 2016 and have been held for a period of three years from 6 April 2016 have been held continuously for a period of three years before disposal.; 1
0116.00017; An individual's qualifying gains for IR are subject to a lifetime cap of £10 million. Share identification rules All shares of the same class in the same company are treated as forming a single asset, regardless of when they were originally acquired. However, 'same day' transactions are matched and the '30 day' anti-avoidance rules will remain.; 0
0116.00018; Example On 15 April 2019 Jeff sold 2000 shares in A plc from his holding of 4000 shares which he had acquired as follows: 1000 in January 1990 1500 in March 2001 1500 in July 2005 Due to significant stock market changes, he decided to purchase 500 shares on 30 April 2019 in the same company.; 1
0116.00019; The disposal of 2000 shares will be matched firstly with the later transaction of 500 shares as it is within the following 30 days and then with 1,500/ 4000 (1000+1500+1500) of the single asset pool on an average cost basis. CGT annual exemption Every tax year each individual is allowed to make gains up to the annual exemption without paying any CGT.; 0
0116.00020; The annual exemption for 2019/20 is £12,000 (£11,700 in 2018/19).; 0
0116.00021; Consideration should be given to ensuring both spouses/civil partners utilise this facility. Exceptions to the CGT rates The rates of CGT are generally 10% and 20%. However 18% and 28% rates apply for carried interest and for chargeable gains on residential property that does not qualify for private residence relief.; 0
0116.00022; Other more complex areas Capital gains can arise in many other situations. Some of these, such as gains on Enterprise Investment Scheme and Venture Capital Trust shares, and deferred gains on share for share or share for loan note exchanges, can be complex. Please talk to us before making any decisions.; 0
0116.00023; Other reliefs which you may be entitled to And finally, many existing reliefs continue to be available, such as: private residence relief business asset rollover relief, which enables the gain on a business asset to be deferred until a point in the future business asset gift relief, which allows the gain on business assets that are given away to be held over until the assets are disposed of by the donee and any unused allowable losses from previous years, which can be brought forward in order to reduce any gains.; 0
0116.00024; How we can help Careful planning of capital asset disposals is essential in order to minimise capital gains tax.; 0
0116.00025; If you live in the Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire area we, at Knox & Eames, would be happy to discuss the options with you.; 0

0119.00001; september 17, 2019 Share Through their newly developed venture arm, the internationally-renowned toy company, LEGO is working with ambitious startups to define the future of play.; 0
0119.00002; But their primary goal isn't capital gains.; 0
0119.00003; The brick remains at the centre of LEGO's brand.; 0
0119.00004; Since it was invented close to 90 years ago, a wealth of products  -  bricks in new shapes, digital add-ons, and even a blockbuster movie  -  have becomes staples within the creative world of LEGO. In 2018, LEGO Ventures was founded in an effort to keep their bricks future-proof.; 0
0119.00005; Its aim is to invest in entrepreneurs, ideas, and startups that align with LEGO's mission to give children worldwide high-quality creative learning and play experiences.; 0
0119.00006; According to Alexis Horowitz-Burdick, managing director of LEGO Ventures: We're exploring the world of creativity, learning, and play. The LEGO company is 87 years old.; 0
0119.00007; At LEGO Ventures, we're looking to the next century of play  -  how LEGO's vision and mission can be adopted by entrepreneurs and how we can support them. Although LEGO's mother company, KIRKBI is behind LEGO Ventures, the primary goal of investing in startups isn't to add more capital to the foundation's bank account. LEGO Ventures: More partner than investor When LEGO Ventures was launched last year, they carved out the following investment areas: education technology, 21st century skill development, new play spaces, and creative making.; 0
0119.00008; As Horowitz-Burdick sees it, The toy  -  the brick  -  is for creative making.; 0
0119.00009; It was developed with the goal of unlocking the creative superpowers of kids.; 0
0119.00010; This goal is shared by the startups we invest in, but their foundation can be both physical and digital. When a startup becomes part of LEGO Ventures' portfolio, they don't just gain access to capital.; 0
0119.00011; The venture arm has also tasked its value creation team with identifying how the two parties can help each other.; 0
0119.00012; Horowitz-Burdick explained, We onboard the startups and align expectations as to where we can help them to accelerate. We anticipate and discuss their challenges for the coming year and figure out where they can tap into the resources across LEGO entities.; 0
0119.00013; This ranges from accessing their extensive knowledge on how children play to solving more logistical issues like supply chain management.; 0
0119.00014; Klang  -  a gaming studio based in Berlin that received an investment  -  is working with LEGO to grow the company in a sustainable way while their game is being built.; 0
0119.00015; Once their ambitious and futuristic game is completed, LEGO's games division will come in handy.; 0
0119.00016; We want to invest in companies where we can support their growth while they contribute to the broader LEGO ecosystem.; 0
0119.00017; We want to be a strong partner to every company we are investing in.; 0
0119.00018; There is a lot of capital in the world, and our value proposition needs to be more than just money.; 0
0119.00019; We are looking to add value beyond the money we're putting in, Horowitz-Burdick explained.; 0
0119.00020; Success is measured beyond capital Investing in startups isn't just looking at current trends and investing for a quick, lucrative exit. LEGO Ventures aims to find the right fit with their mission and brand.; 0
0119.00021; In Horowitz-Burdick's words: LEGO is an incredible brand.; 0
0119.00022; We get to leverage that, and we want to protect it. LEGO means a lot to almost every entrepreneur we meet, and that's amazing.; 0
0119.00023; It means entrepreneurs understand what LEGO is about.; 0
0119.00024; The focus of the return on investment is based more on strategy than finances. We bring LEGO's core ethos into the fund, and one thing unique to LEGO is their partner-promise: the way we work with and treat partners.; 0
0119.00025; It has to be advantageous to both parties. The financial return is not our primary goal and not even our secondary goal.; 0
0119.00026; We're not trying to make bad investments, but our investments are more strategic.; 0
0119.00027; We're trying to learn the future of play and find new ventures to tap into that future, Horowitz-Burdick observed.; 0
0119.00028; LEGO's portfolio company, Klang is showcasing a demo of its game at this years' TechBBQ.; 0

0120.00001; Holiday chaos as Thomas Cook goes bust leaving 150,000 Brits stranded Glasgow holiday chaos as Thomas Cook goes bust leaving 150,000 Brits stranded  TRAVEL giant Thomas Cook has ceased trading after failing to secure a last-ditch rescue deal, leaving an estimated 150,000 Britons abroad awaiting repatriation.; 1
0120.00002; The company was unable to secure the extra £200 million needed to keep the business afloat following a full day of crucial talks with the major shareholder and creditors on Sunday.; 0
0120.00003; Richard Moriarty, the chief executive of the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), said the government had asked his organisation to launch the UK's largest ever peacetime repatriation.; 0
0120.00004; In a statement, the CAA said: Thomas Cook Group, including the UK tour operator and airline, has ceased trading with immediate effect. All Thomas Cook bookings, including flights and holidays, have now been cancelled.; 0
0120.00005; Thomas Cook's chief executive Peter Fankhauser said his company had worked exhaustively to salvage a rescue package.; 0
0120.00006; Although a deal had been largely agreed, an additional facility requested in the last few days of negotiations presented a challenge that ultimately proved insurmountable, he added. It is a matter of profound regret to me and the rest of the board that we were not successful.; 0
0120.00007; I would like to apologise to our millions of customers, and thousands of employees, suppliers and partners who have supported us for many years. This marks a deeply sad day for the company which pioneered package holidays and made travel possible for millions of people around the world. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to help holidaymakers stranded by the firm's closure, as he questioned whether bosses are not incentivised to prevent their business's demise.; 0

0123.00001; By Mohammed Yusuf Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Print this page Comments NAIROBI, KENYA - More and more African countries are taxing digital platforms and mobile money transfers to fund economic development. Nigeria is the latest country to join the trend, with a new 5%  tax on items bought online.; 1
0123.00002; It wants banks to deduct the tax from online transactions for the government.; 0
0123.00003; Segun Abiona is the founder of Nicole and Giovanni, a Nigerian company that sells men's accessories.; 0
0123.00004; He says more taxes will reduce the gains he has made.; 0
0123.00005; It's a form of double taxation on us because if you tax every transaction that comes online we still end up paying taxes, which is 5% VAT (value-added tax), 5%  of every sale we make in terms of VAT, Abiona said. It is going to discourage internet purchases knowing we are fully grown in terms of online space.; 0
0123.00006; We are still trying to encourage more people to shop online and at the same time eradicate the fear of people being get scammed online.; 0
0123.00007; According to some business analysts, at least 100 million people on the continent use mobile financial services. A Kenya Airways flight attendant uses her cell phone as they gather at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport  near Nairobi, Kenya, March 6, 2019.; 0

0123.00011; A year ago, the Ugandan government imposed heavy taxes on social media use, forcing millions to abandon some platforms such as Twitter and WhatsApp. Ugandan authorities say they introduced the tax to curb idle talk, but some government critics viewed it as an effort to stop dissent. In neighboring Kenya, the government has been increasing taxes on mobile money transfers.; 0
0123.00012; And this month the Kenya Revenue Authority said it will start taxing many applications developed and downloaded in the country.; 0
0123.00013; The head of Kenya's Institute of Economic Affairs, Kwame Owino, says people will find ways to avoid paying taxes for using digital platforms.; 0
0123.00014; So people may decide if you are going to tax too much [the] transfer of money from one person to another, then people may go back using the informal methods, Owino said. So part of it is that transactions will go back down to [lower] levels, it may also affect savings in the formal sector area in the sense that if you have to transfer money and all that, they may decide to do mattress banking as they always did.; 0

0131.00002; Every investor in a stock has a choice: bite our fingernails over the short-term ups and downs that are inevitable with the stock market, or, zero in on stocks we are comfortable to simply buy and hold for the long haul  -  maybe even a five year holding period.; 0
0131.00003; Heck, investors can even choose to completely ignore the stock market's short-run quotations and instead go into their initial investment planning to hold on for years and years regardless of the fluctuations in price that might occur next.; 0
0131.00004; Today, we examine what would have happened over a five year holding period, had you decided back in 2014 to buy shares of Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc (NYSE: MAA) and simply hold through to today. - MAA 5-Year Return Details  - Start date: - 09/22/2014 -  - $10,000  09/22/2014 - - $23,492  09/19/2019  - End date: - 09/19/2019  - Start price/share: - $66.44  - End price/share: - $129.82  - Starting shares: - 150.51  - Ending shares: - 180.95  - Dividends reinvested/share: - $17.14  - Total return: - 134.90%  - Average annual return: - 18.65%  - Starting investment: - $10,000.00  - Ending investment: - $23,492.64  The above analysis shows the five year investment result worked out exceptionally well, with an annualized rate of return of 18.65%. This would have turned a $10K investment made 5 years ago into $23,492.64 today (as of 09/19/2019).; 1
0131.00005; On a total return basis, that's a result of 134.90% (something to think about: how might MAA shares perform over the next 5 years?).; 0
0131.00006; [These numbers were computed with the Dividend Channel DRIP Returns Calculator.]; 0
0131.00007; Beyond share price change, another component of MAA's total return these past 5 years has been the payment by Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc of $17.14/share in dividends to shareholders.; 0
0131.00008; Automatic reinvestment of dividends can be a wonderful way to compound returns, and for the above calculations we presume that dividends are reinvested into additional shares of stock. (For the purpose of these calcuations, the closing price on ex-date is used). Based upon the most recent annualized dividend rate of 3.84/share, we calculate that MAA has a current yield of approximately 2.96%.; 0
0131.00009; Another interesting datapoint we can examine is 'yield on cost'  -  in other words, we can express the current annualized dividend of 3.84 against the original $66.44/share purchase price.; 0
0131.00010; This works out to a yield on cost of 4.46%.; 0

0134.00006; Most of the year-to-date revenue shortfall comes down to severance taxes missing estimates by $26.8 million and personal income tax collection coming up $21.78 million short, because of the downturn in high-paying construction jobs, he said.; 1
0134.00007; He also said steel production has dropped nationally, reducing demand for metallurgical coal.; 0
0134.00008; Muchow said part of August's $16.8 million shortfall was a timing issue, with the last day of the month falling on a Saturday, meaning that a lot of taxes due on the 31st will show up as September revenue.; 1
0134.00009; I think the numbers in September will be closer to estimates than they are today, he said, adding, That will help cut into the shortfall for the year-to-date. However, he said softness in the energy sector is likely to persist long-term.; 0
0134.00010; Muchow said state agency heads have been asked to propose 4 percent midyear spending cuts, in the event revenue collection continues to fall below estimates.; 0
0134.00011; He stressed that the cuts would be worst-case scenario, and said preparing midyear cuts is an exercise most agency heads have gone through on repeated occasions.; 0
0134.00012; Our agencies have been used to midyear budget cuts, he said.; 0
0134.00013; Also Monday, Amy Willard, director of school finance for the state Department of Education, put the cost of the omnibus education bill passed in June at $134.1 million a year. The largest cost will be $62.7 million per year for 5 percent, on average, pay raises for teachers and school service personnel, along with a $5 million-a-year increase in pension fund contributions to account for higher future retirement benefits.; 1
0134.00014; Willard said some of the cost figures are guesstimates, such as the $2.1 million a year cost to provide $500 bonuses to teachers who use four or fewer personal leave days each year.; 0

0136.00001; Previous Next open Finance Finance start-up SoFi strikes deal to put its name on new LA stadium for the Rams and Chargers Published 6 min ago Key Points The eight-year-old start-up, which began with student loan refinancing, is buying the exclusive naming rights to the Los Angeles football stadium that's set to open next summer.; 0
0136.00002; The two-decade SoFi Stadium deal includes a partnership with the Rams and Chargers, who will both play home games at the Inglewood, California arena.; 0
0136.00003; There's a long history of financial services companies buying stadium naming rights.; 0
0136.00004; But it's rare for a young, venture capital-backed, private company to have its name on a major sports arena. Anthony Noto, CEO of SoFi Adam Jeffery | CNBC Financial technology start-up Social Finance is putting its name on the most expensive NFL stadium ever built.; 0
0136.00005; The company announced a 20-year deal on Sunday to call the new Los Angeles football compound SoFi Stadium. The 3-million-square-foot arena, which will be home to both the Rams and the Chargers, is set to open next summer.; 0
0136.00006; The San Francisco-based company will become an official partner of both LA football teams, as well as a partner of the performance venue and surrounding entertainment district.; 0
0136.00007; SoFi did not disclose how much it paid for the naming rights, but Venues Now and Fox Business, which reported earlier this year that a deal was in discussion, said it was a $400 million price tag.; 0
0136.00008; This is a giant leap toward achieving our company's mission of helping people get their money right by reaching our members where they are, said Anthony Noto, SoFi CEO and a former CFO of the NFL, in a press release.; 0
0136.00009; This partnership is the perfect opportunity to drive awareness and trust in the SoFi brand as we continue to grow and reach members on a national level. SoFi will be the only Silicon Valley start-up in the NFL stadium ranks. The Inglewood, California stadium has gained attention for its size -- and its price.; 0
0136.00010; Los Angeles Rams owner and real estate mogul Stan Kroenke is financing the stadium as a part of his 298-acre sports and entertainment district. The project is expected to cost just under $5 billion, more than double the average cost for a new NFL stadium. The new Raiders stadium , for example, was estimated to cost just under $2 billion.; 0
0136.00011; It was critical for us to find a tech-focused partner who is on the cutting edge and genuinely understands the needs of all of our constituents and who challenges us to think in creative ways to make every visitor to SoFi Stadium and Hollywood Park feel special and at home, Kroenke said in the press release.; 0
0136.00012; The indoor-outdoor facility will host Super Bowl LVI in 2022, the College Football National Championship game in 2023, and the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the 2028 Olympic Games.; 0

0136.00014; Its marketing budget has exceeded $200 million in previous years, and the stadium deal would likely be a part of a larger effort to gain name recognition.; 0
0136.00015; SoFi started in 2011 with millennial student-loan refinancing.; 0

0137.00004; By Michelle Singletary, Columnist  Share All sharing options for: The fight over shutting down the CFPB consumer complaint database is over.; 0
0137.00005; Shutterstock  WASHINGTON  -  Consumers have won a big victory in favor of transparency for a change.; 0
0137.00006; The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has decided it won't remove from public view a complaint database that consumers use to ask for help in resolving financial issues, such as problems with a debt collector, mortgage lender or student loan servicer.; 0
0137.00007; For example, if you've tried but failed to get a credit bureau to remove erroneous information from your credit file, you're almost certain to get a response if you submit a complaint to the CFPB.; 0
0137.00008; This isn't the typical complaint box where grievances go to die.; 0
0137.00009; Since launching the database, the bureau has handled 1.9 million complaints and forwarded more than 1.3 million to companies for a reply, CFPB Director Kathleen Kraninger said during a recent speech at the National Consumer Empowerment Conference. More than 5,000 companies have responded to 97% of consumers filing a complaint, she said.; 1
0137.00010; In fact, the U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a nonpartisan consumer-advocacy group, analyzed complaints made through the CFPB and found that more than 223,000 grievances resulted in relief for consumers. More than 75,000 people got money back from the companies they complained about, according to the report released earlier this year.; 0
0137.00011; The database opens a window onto the marketplace, said Ed Mierzwinski, U.S. PIRG senior director for Federal Consumer Programs.; 0
0137.00012; There is no perfect way to study the financial industry.; 0
0137.00013; We need this window open.; 0
0137.00014; But as you might imagine, the companies being complained about don't like the complaint database being public.; 0
0137.00015; They argue that people are only getting one side of the story and that the complaints might not be accurate.; 0
0137.00016; It should be noted that the bureau also gives companies the option to post a public response. Since its inception, the Consumer Complaint Database has not been without controversy, Kraninger said in a statement about the changes.; 0
0137.00017; Mick Mulvaney, the former interim head of the CFPB and now acting White House chief of staff, didn't want to keep the database public despite the fact that the bureau is required to provide certain information to Congress about complaints and responses. In referring to the rule Mulvaney said, I don't see anything in here that I have to run a Yelp for financial services sponsored by the federal government. Consumer advocates contend that the complaint narratives potentially provide insight into illegal or unfair practices.; 0
0137.00018; But to appease businesses, the CFPB is making some changes to the complaint system, most notably adding disclaimers, which the agency is calling enhancements.; 0
0137.00019; The bureau is also exploring how to put consumer complaints in context by adding market share and company size. The theory being large companies with a huge consumer base would of course have more complaints.; 0
0137.00020; In the meantime, let me put the CFPB disclosure language in context with Mierzwinski's assistance.; 0
0137.00021; CFPB says: This database is not a statistical sample of consumers' experiences in the marketplace. … Complaint volume should be considered in the context of company size and/or market share.; 0
0137.00022; For example, companies with more customers may have more complaints than companies with fewer customers. I say: Don't let this clear shill for the companies deter you from looking through the information for similarities to your situation. Go to consumerfinance.gov/complaint to view other people's stories.; 0
0137.00023; Click yes to show complaints with narratives.; 0
0137.00024; The database has tremendous value, Mierzwinski said. That's why industry wanted it shut down, not because it needed to be viewed in context but because it opened a clear window on the marketplace they wanted kept shut.; 0
0137.00025; CFPB says: We don't verify all the allegations in complaint narratives.; 0
0137.00026; And unproven allegations in consumer narratives should be regarded as opinion, not fact.; 0
0137.00027; I say: Well here we go  -  the old alternative fact defense, a line made infamous by White House counselor Kellyanne Conway.; 0
0137.00028; Yes, in telling their story consumers are conveying the situation from their point of view. But think about how unjust something must feel for someone to take the time to file a grievance.; 0
0137.00029; One complaint may not say much about a firm, but if as few as two or three consumers tell the same story, others might say, 'that's exactly what happened to me' and file a complaint, too, which will lead to needed changes at the firm, or even to a pattern or practice enforcement action, Mierzwinski said. CFPB says: Complaints can give us insights into problems people are experiencing in the marketplace and help us regulate consumer financial products and services under existing federal consumer financial laws.; 0
0137.00030; I say: The CFPB made the right call in not shutting down the consumer complaint database. Let there be light.; 0

0138.00001; Share The prudential regulator's authority has been severely undermined by its Federal Court loss against wealth company IOOF , lawyers and academics said. But analysts say there are no guarantees that IOOF's legal victory will pave the way for it to complete its takeover of ANZ's wealth business. Allens partner Michelle Levy, an expert in superannuation law, said the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority failed dismally to prove IOOF breached its obligation to act in the best interests of members.; 0
0138.00002; She queried the lack of legal expertise within the upper ranks of the regulator, which she said was dominated by actuaries. They ran an extremely poor case, Ms Levy said.; 0
0138.00003; In terms of what the judgment means for the industry, I think it's a real pity because they are very legitimate concerns [about conflicted decision-making processes] that APRA is raising.; 0
0138.00004; Related Quotes Advertisement [The judge] doesn't grapple with real questions about conflict and I think that's because of the way APRA ran the case.; 0
0138.00005; APRA alleged that IOOF and some of its directors were conflicted when they decided to use an operational risk reserve to compensate members for an administrative error rather than suing a third party or using shareholder capital. Members were, the regulator argued unsuccessfully, reimbursed using their own money.; 0
0138.00006; IOOF had a conflicted corporate and governance structure, which created an environment ripe for conflicts of interest and conflicts of duties to manifest, APRA claimed.; 0
0138.00007; But Federal Court Justice Jayne Jagot said APRA's legal arguments were unpersuasive.; 0
0138.00008; She identified as a systemic weakness the regulator's reliance on internally generated breach reports rather than bringing forward other evidence that IOOF failed to act in members' best interests.; 0
0138.00009; [Justice Jagot] completely dismisses the idea that the breach report can be evidence of a breach itself, which is extremely interesting, Ms Levy said.; 0
0138.00010; Even with the case won, there are still questions over whether IOOF will manage to finalise a $1 billion bid for ANZ's pension and investments business. APRA had been seeking additional licence conditions for two IOOF subsidiaries, as well as disqualification orders against former chief executive  Chris Kelaher , former chairman George Venardos and a number of other IOOF executives.; 0
0138.00011; Advertisement Morgan Stanley analyst Daniel Toohey said although the matter of APRA's intended licence conditions had been resolved, ANZ might still walk away from the deal on the stipulated deadline of October 17. Given conditions precedent, the deal completing under current terms seems unlikely, he said.; 0
0138.00012; ANZ declined to comment on the status of the OnePath transaction or Friday's Federal Court decision, but sources within the bank agreed the legal triumph would not be sufficient to clinch the deal.; 0
0138.00013; APRA's effectiveness as a regulator was heavily criticised by the banking royal commission and in the recent capability review led by Graeme Samuel. Prior to the IOOF action, APRA had not taken a super trustee to court for more than a decade.; 0
0138.00014; It's a terrible outcome for APRA at this point, said University of NSW legal academic Scott Donald, who advised the Cooper Review of superannuation.; 0
0138.00015; It appears as if they've rushed into this and made a mess of it. APRA was represented by Gadens and the IOOF entities by King & Wood Mallesons.; 0
0138.00016; Advertisement A significant element of APRA's case involved allegations that IOOF directors acted improperly when they decided to reimburse members for certain losses using what are known as reserves.; 0
0138.00017; Justice Jagot rejected APRA's view.; 0
0138.00018; This undermines a large swathe of APRA's case, founded as it is on the impropriety of the respondents' conduct in proposing the use of or using the [reserve] to reimburse members for certain losses, she said.; 0
0138.00019; Since 2013, super funds have been required to maintain an operational risk reserve sufficient to cover the costs of a significant event, such as a unit pricing error.; 0
0138.00020; Dr Donald said the law regarding the use of operational risk reserves needed updating to make explicit what the money could be used for. He said APRA's long-standing aversion to litigation meant prudential standards were written in a manner that was incongruent to legal proceedings, and they would need updating.; 0
0138.00021; If they seek to enforce them in court they are going to have to have a close look at the way they are drafted, Dr Donald said. Morningstar wealth market analyst Chanaka Gunasekera said IOOF's woes continued beyond the APRA dispute, though he declined to comment specifically on the OnePath transaction. Advertisement The Federal Court result appears a win for the company but it still faces significant issues, Mr Gunasekera said.; 0
0138.00022; At IOOF's 2019 results announcement, management estimated client remediation costs of about $183 million and remediation processing costs of about $40 million. Class action lawyers are also probably circling the company, so it wouldn't be a surprise if there was further court action down the track. A former IOOF senior manager, speaking to the Financial Review on condition of anonymity, said discomfort within the group's network of self-employed and aligned financial advisers over reputation risk would also fail to be eased by the company's Federal Court vindication.; 0
0138.00023; According to data from research house Adviser Ratings, IOOF has 142 fewer financial advisers in its network in September 2019 than it had in December 2018, when APRA's proceedings were commenced. In order to proceed with its purchase, IOOF would need not only the approval of the ANZ Wealth trustee, but also APRA's green light  -  at least in respect to the superannuation entities within the OnePath pensions and investments business.; 0
0138.00024; IOOF's chief executive Renato Mota previously acknowledged that the APRA approval requirement, which only came into effect as part of changes to superannuation laws which took effect on July 5, adds an additional layer of uncertainty to their plans, which were first unveiled in 2017.; 0
0138.00025; Advertisement However, APRA's response to the Federal Court decision may offer a glimmer of hope for IOOF. Despite admitting APRA was disappointed by the decision, and leaving the door open to an appeal, deputy chair Helen Rowell also praised the changes implemented by IOOF since legal action was pursued against it.; 0
0138.00026; APRA has seen significant improvement in the level of cooperation from IOOF since this case was launched, Ms Rowell said. Additionally, the new licence conditions have enhanced IOOF's organisational structure and governance, including the role and independence of the trustee board within the IOOF group.; 0
0138.00027; Shares in IOOF closed up 7.93 per cent on Friday at $5.99 following the court's decision.; 1

0139.00009; When stock market valuations are low, such as during the 2008 Financial Crisis when Philip Morris and Altria split, those merger rationales are less likely to be believed.; 0
0139.00010; But when valuations are high, as they are now, those same rationales seem far more believable. Rhodes-Kropf's research also helps to explain two other features of M&A activity: It tends to come in waves, and all past waves have ended with the overall U.S. market declining sharply.; 0
0139.00011; This latter feature of the historical record is an especially ominous precedent for today's market, since the proposed Philip Morris-Altria merger is part of a wave that has been building for several years now.; 0
0139.00012; And though Rhodes-Kropf emphasizes that there's no way of telling when this wave will crest, he thinks it is probable that it will end just as badly as all the others.; 0
0139.00013; It's also worth noting that Rhodes-Kropf's research doesn't mean that a merger between Philip Morris and Altria is a bad idea.; 0
0139.00014; It may well be that the market capitalization of the combined company will grow faster (or decline more slowly) than if the two companies stayed separate. Still, seeing this proposed Philip Morris-Altria merger within the historical context of past M&A waves in the U.S leads to a heightened concern for the stock market's future.; 0

0143.00001; By  Karen Hube  Illustration by Michael Driver  Text size  Not all of the best tax breaks require a deep dive into the federal tax code by a sophisticated and pricey tax attorney. One of the simplest is often overlooked: the health savings account, known as an HSA.These accounts, around since 2003, offer three tax breaks wrapped up into one, but their value is widely underestimated by wealthy families. Only half of my clients are aware if they have an HSA when they come to me for the first time, says Jill Garvey, a senior wealth strategist at Huntington National Bank.; 0
0143.00002; If they know they have the option, they think it's not worth it because there's a cap on their contributions.; 0
0143.00003; In fact, the HSA isn't just a powerful tool to save for health-care needs with careful accounting, wealthy folks can leave HSA assets untouched for years, growing tax-deferred. Later, they can be used either for health care or other costs in retirement. Taxpayers are eligible to open an HSA if their health insurance policy has a high deductible a deductible must be at least $1,350 for a single policy and $2,700 for a family policy.; 0
0143.00004; These accounts work much like 401(k)s or IRAs to accumulate assets.; 0
0143.00005; Employees can make contributions to an HSA with pretax dollars.; 0
0143.00006; For those who invest in an HSA independently of an employer, the contributions are tax-deductible - even for those who claim the standard deduction and don't itemize deductions. Assets grow tax- deferred in underlying investments.; 0
0143.00007; $7,000  Maximum contribution for couples this year in a health savings account.; 0
0143.00008; 55  Age at which individuals can contribute an extra $1,000.; 1
0143.00009; 20%  Penalty incurred if HSA funds are used for anything but health-care costs prior to 65.; 1
0143.00010; Contribution limits usually rise each year to adjust for inflation. This year, maximum investments are $3,500 for singles and $7,000 for couples.; 1
0143.00011; Those over age 55 can contribute an extra annual $1,000.; 1
0143.00012; Contributions for the calendar year can be made until the tax-filing deadline of the following year - so a 2019 contribution can be made anytime until April 15, 2020. Assets can be taken out tax-free as long as they're used to cover health-care expenses.; 0
0143.00013; It's a wonderful tool for paying medical expenses during your lifetime, Garvey says.; 0
0143.00014; Assuming the $7,000 maximum contribution rises $100 annually and is invested for a 5% average annual return, a 40-year-old couple getting started with an HSA now would have $428,000 by age 65, Garvey says. That's about $100,000 more than if they had put the money into a taxable account, assuming the couple is in the 35% tax bracket.; 1
0143.00015; Just about all states mimic the federal tax code when it comes to HSAs, with some exceptions such as California and New Jersey. When the account holder dies, the HSA can pass to the surviving spouse and retain its tax-free status for withdrawals. If inherited by a nonspouse beneficiary, assets in the account are subject to income taxes.; 0
0143.00016; Money taken out prior to age 65 and used for anything but health-care expenses are subject not only to income taxes, but a 20% penalty, too.; 1
0143.00017; But after 65, these accounts can be used more broadly.; 0
0143.00018; At this stage, there's no penalty for using assets for expenses besides health care, but they will be counted as income and subject to income taxes, just as with a 401(k) or IRA.; 0
0143.00019; To maximize these accounts, it's best to let them grow untouched and pay for health-care expenses with out-of-pocket funds.; 0
0143.00020; Years later, the tax-deferred account can be used to reimburse these expenses, tax-free. You can open an account today, fund it for many years, but not touch it and instead allow it to grow tax-deferred.; 0
0143.00021; You can then use it to pay for any qualified expenses during retirement and the withdrawals will be tax-free, says Tim Steffen, director of advanced planning at Baird Private Wealth Management.; 0
0143.00022; Or, he adds, you can also use it to reimburse yourself for expenses incurred in prior years. The expenses don't have to be incurred in the same year as the withdrawal, just sometime after the account was opened.; 0
0143.00023; The caveat: It's important to keep excellent records over the years. Compile receipts for expenses, and bank or credit-card statements showing how non-HSA funds were used to cover expenses.; 0
0143.00024; Cumbersome as that may seem, those records will come in handy in the future for drawing on a potentially six-figure account, tax-free.; 0

0147.00001; Curtailment of letting relief - Make Sense  16643  post-template-default,single,single-post,postid-16643,single-format-standard,ajax_fade,page_not_loaded,,qode_grid_1300,footer_responsive_adv,qode-child-theme-ver-1.0.0,qode-theme-ver-10.0,wpb-js-composer js-comp-ver-5.0.1,vc_responsive  Posted at 11:16h in blog by Sheryl 0 Comments  0 Likes  Landlords have been hit with a number of tax hikes in recent years, and this trend shows no signs of abating. From 6 April 2020, lettings relief  -  a valuable capital gains tax relief which is available where a property which has at some point been the owner's only or main residence is let out  -  is seriously curtailed.; 0
0147.00002; Now  Under the current rules letting relief applies to shelter part of the gain arising on the sale of a property which has been let out as residential accommodation and which at some time was the owner's only or main residence.; 0
0147.00003; The amount of letting relief is the lowest of the following three amounts:  the amount of private residence relief available on the disposal £40,000 and the gain attributable to the letting. Under the current rules, periods of residential letting count regardless of whether or not the landlord also lives in the property.; 0
0147.00004; From 6 April 2020  From 6 April 2020, lettings relief will only be available where the owner of the property shares occupancy with a tenant. From that date, lettings relief is available where at some point the owner of the property lets out part of their main residence as residential accommodation and shares occupation of that residence with an individual who has no interest in the residence.; 0
0147.00005; To the extent that a gain that would otherwise be chargeable to capital gains tax because it relates to the part of the main residence which is let out as residential accommodation, the availability of lettings relief means that it is only chargeable to capital gains tax to the extent that it exceeds the lower of:  the amount of the gain sheltered by private residence relief and £40,000.; 0
0147.00006; Example 1  Tom owns a property which he lives in as his main residence.; 0
0147.00007; He lived in it for a year on his own, then to help pay the bills he let out 40% as residential accommodation.; 1
0147.00008; In June 2020 he sells the property realising a gain of £189,000. He had owned the property for five years and three months (63 months). The final nine months of ownership are covered by the final period exemption  -  this equates to £27,000.; 0
0147.00009; For the remaining 54 months, private residence relief is available for the first 12 months and 40% of the remaining 48 months  -  a total of 31.2 months (12 + (40% x 48)).; 0
0147.00010; This is worth £93,600.; 0
0147.00011; (31.2/63 x £189,000). Private residence relief in total is worth £120,600 (£27,000 + £93,600).; 0
0147.00012; The gain attributable to the letting is £68,400 (£189,000  -  £120,600).; 0
0147.00013; This is taxable to the extent that exceeds £40,000 (being the lower of £40,000 and £120,600).; 0
0147.00014; Thus the letting relief is worth £40,000 and the chargeable gain is £28,400.; 0
0147.00015; Example 2  Lucy buys a flat for £300,000 which she lives in for one year as her main residence.; 0
0147.00016; She then buys a new home which she lives in as her main residence and lets the flat out for three years, before selling it and realising a gain of £96,000.; 1
0147.00017; If she sells it before 6 April 2020, she will be entitled to private residence relief of £60,000 (30/48 x £96,000).; 1
0147.00018; The final 18 months are exempt as she lived in the flat for 12 months as her main residence.; 1
0147.00019; The gain attributable to letting is £36,000, all of which is sheltered by lettings relief (as less than both private residence relief and £40,000).; 0
0147.00020; If she sells the property after 6 April 2020, the final period exemption only covers the last nine months, reducing the private residence relief to £42,000 (21/48 x £96,000).; 1
0147.00021; The remainder of the gain of £54,000, which is attributable to the letting, is chargeable to capital gains tax as letting relief is no longer available as Lucy does not share her home with the tenant.; 0
0147.00022; Consider realising a gain on a let property which has also been the main residence prior to 6 April 2020 to take advantage of the letting relief available prior to that date where a landlord does not share the accommodation with the tenant.; 0

0148.00001; Chief Executive Jeff Bezos on Thursday committed the company to being carbon neutral by 2040 and said part of that pledge is an order for 100,000 electric delivery vans from a start-up the online retailer has invested in.; 1
0148.00002; Cutting emissions is a challenging goal for Amazon, which delivers 10 billion items a year and has a massive transportation footprint. We know we can do it and we know we have to do it, Bezos said. Bezos announced a number of actions at a press conference in Washington ahead of Climate Week in New York next week, a global gathering of world and company leaders seeking ways to fight climate change.; 0
0148.00003; Bezos said Amazon will meet the goals of the Paris climate accord 10 years ahead of schedule. The Trump administration said in June 2017 it was withdrawing from the Paris climate accord. Bezos also said Amazon was ordering 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from US vehicle design and manufacturing startup Rivian Automotive LLC and would use 100 percent renewable energy by 2030, up from 40 percent today.; 1
0148.00004; Amazon and Ford Motor Co. are among the investors in Rivian. Bezos said the first electric delivery vans for Amazon will be on the road by 2021, and all 100,000 will be deployed by 2024.; 0
0148.00005; Amazon will also invest $100 million to restore forests and wetlands, said Bezos, adding the company will take a careful look at political campaign contributions it makes that could be going to politicians that deny climate science.; 1
0148.00006; We've been in the middle of the herd on this issue and we want to move to the forefront.; 0
0148.00007; Amazon previously said it would order 20,000 delivery vans from Daimler AG.; 0
0148.00008; Bezos did not put a total dollar figure on the efforts to decarbonise but said many of the efforts would save money.; 0
0148.00009; We've been in the middle of the herd on this issue and we want to move to the forefront, Bezos said.; 0
0148.00010; He vowed to try to convince other company CEOs to sign The Climate Pledge. Separately, a Rivian spokeswoman declined to discuss the financial terms but said the vehicles for Amazon will be assembled in Illinois and 10,000 will be on the road by late 2022.; 0
0148.00011; Rivian added that when the fleet is fully deployed, it will save 4 million metric tons of CO2 a year.; 1
0148.00012; In recent months, some Amazon workers have pushed the company to take action on climate change, in employee activism that has been atypical for the online retailer. They have taken issue with Amazon's cloud computing deals with oil-drilling companies, and they have raised concern in an open letter to Bezos and at the company's most recent annual meeting.; 0
0148.00013; Bezos said Amazon would continue to work with energy companies.; 0
0148.00014; To ask oil and energy companies to do this transition with bad tools is not a good idea and we won't do that, Bezos said.; 0
0148.00015; A proposal that the company report how it plans to deal with climate change received only 29.8 percent of votes at the shareholder meeting, despite signatures in support from nearly 7,700 employees. Some Amazon workers were also planning to walk out this Friday in support of the global climate strike.

0149.00002; Guy Quenneville · CBC News ·  Saskatoon city councillors have effectively closed debate on the idea of reducing the frequency of garbage pickup service. (Jenna Leith/CBC)  It went from hot topic to dead issue very quickly.; 0
0149.00003; On Monday, Saskatoon city councillors effectively closed debate on the idea of reducing the frequency of garbage pickup service.; 0
0149.00004; The subject arose as city councillors brainstormed ways to pare down an expected property tax increase for 2020.; 0
0149.00005; Councillors heard that moving to collection every second week would save the city $500,000 a year.; 1
0149.00006; But the effect of two key votes Monday against the accumulation of more information means an actual decision on switching up the schedule won't happen at the 2020 budget talks this November, as originally appeared to be a possibility. 'It doesn't make sense' Coun. Zach Jeffries said he'd already made up his mind on the issue based on the initial information presented Monday. It doesn't make any sense to reduce black bin pickup at this point, so doesn't seem to make any sense to put administration [to] work, he said.; 0
0149.00007; I have no interest in reducing our black cart pickup until we have a citywide organics program, echoed Coun. Hilary Gough. That program is set to launch in 2023. The city had reported that reducing black bin service might prompt more people to use the city's green cart program for food and yard waste  -  which could then result in increased costs for that program.; 0
0149.00008; I don't think that the savings listed in this report in particular with the other implications are sufficient enough to convince me to do so, Gough added.; 0

0150.00001; September 19, 2019  No Comments  On February 14, 2008, a Seattle Times article showed that almost 45 percent of the price of a home was to cover the costs of land-use regulations. To be clear, those are zoning regulations.; 0
0150.00002; On a $447,800 home, $200,000 of that price was for regulations. For most people graduating from school, getting a job with a livable wage, developing a relationship, and perhaps starting a family are big steps in life.; 0
0150.00003; However, the government has its hand in your pocket all the way, as many young, first-time homebuyers are finding out.; 0
0150.00004; According to a US Department of Labor study, in 1901 families in the United States spent 23.3 percent of their income on housing.; 0
0150.00005; By 1934-1936, families were spending 32 percent of their income on housing.; 0
0150.00006; Today, housing consumes over 30 percent of our income for most of us, and those in the lowest 20 percent of income bracket are paying almost 40 percent of their income for housing. Costs decline from there, with the wealthiest quintile paying 29.9 percent of their income for housing. In 2002, economists Edward L. Glaeser and Joseph Gyourko authored The Impact of Zoning on Housing Affordability.; 0
0150.00007; In their conclusion, they noted that  …reducing the implied zoning tax on new construction could well have a massive impact on housing prices. Then, in 2015, economists Chang-Tai Hsieh and Enrico Moretti published a study on land use laws that gave us an idea as to what the financial impact is on homeowners and the nation as a whole.; 0
0150.00008; In a New York Times op-ed they wrote:  The creeping web of these regulations has smothered wage and gross domestic product growth in American cities by a stunning 50 percent over the past 50 years. Without these regulations, our research shows, the United States economy today would be 9 percent bigger  -  which would mean, for the average American worker, an additional $6,775 in annual income.; 1
0150.00009; Higher housing costs are not the only costs that people are burdened with because of these regulations. Jason Furman, chairman of the Obama Administration Council of Economic Advisers, was critical of land-use regulations. In a speech at the Urban Institute in 2015, he mentioned a number of problems that result from zoning, from higher costs for potential homeowners to environmental issues.; 0
0150.00010; Zoning regulations and urban renewal have greatly reduced low-cost opportunities such as boarding houses and residential hotels, where 30 percent or more of the urban population once found shelter.; 1
0150.00011; When the supply of housing is reduced, job opportunities are also lost by crafts workers and laborers in the housing industry.; 0
0150.00012; Rigid applications of zoning regulations drive up home values.; 0
0150.00013; Then, when a downturn occurs, homeowners who find it difficult to sell because of the artificially inflated value of their home abandon their homes, but they may still end up paying to cover any difference between what the home eventually sells for and the mortgage note. A report on foreclosures prepared for the US Senate listed a cost to homeowners of $7,200.; 1
0150.00014; Neighboring homeowners may experience costs averaging $3,000, while the cost to lenders may be as much as $50,000.; 0
0150.00015; And the city may end up paying for police services because of increased crime in the area, as well as other services ranging anywhere from $400 to $34,000 while seeing property taxes decline.; 0
0150.00016; A Rand Corp. study  …found that single-use commercially zoned blocks in Los Angeles have crime rates that are 45 percent higher than similar blocks that include residential uses. We can expect to see similar problems in areas where a number of homes have been foreclosed on.; 0
0150.00017; Then there are the families that are affected by the foreclosures. It isn't always just dollars and cents.; 0
0150.00018; A study from the American Journal of Public Health, as reported on the web site Citylab,  [found] that suicides spurred by severe housing stress - evictions and foreclosures - doubled between 2005 and 2010.; 0
0150.00019; With zoning limiting the supply and the price of housing increasing, the chance of foreclosure goes up during an economic downturn.; 0
0150.00020; The stress on families increases, which can lead marriages to break up.; 0
0150.00021; In turn, we see an increase in domestic problems, suicide, and children with problems in school.; 0
0150.00022; All of this often leads to more government involvement, from simple things like unemployment benefits to child services agencies. The Trickle-Down Effects One estimate suggests that  More than 8 million children were affected by the recent foreclosure crisis.; 0
0150.00023; During the Great Recession, … food stamp program--renamed the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), grew from $30.4 billion in 2007 to $71.8 billion in 2011, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston noted in 2012.; 1
0150.00024; That loss of workers will have an impact if the industry rebounds, and the loss could lead to other problems, such as homelessness.; 0
0150.00025; Foreclosure affects local government from the schools to the courts, all of which bear some financial part of the burden imposed by inflexible zoning laws. We can work together to break down rules that stand in the way of building new housing and that keep families from moving to growing, dynamic cities,  President Obama, remarked to the US Conference of Mayors in January 2016.; 0
0150.00026; The costs of the regulations may reduce the supply of homes, driving up the cost of existing homes that are on the market.; 0
0150.00027; Those who can afford to buy will pay a higher cost.; 0
0150.00028; Others who can't will do without and continue to rent or even become homeless. As a result, homeowners may pay higher property taxes, and the local business community will miss the disposable income local homeowners no longer have.; 0
0150.00029; Repealing the mandatory single-family style of housing found in many cities will allow a greater variety of housing to be built. This will provide low-income workers with an opportunity to find housing closer to work and reduce their travel expenses.; 0
0150.00030; Those selling homes will certainly benefit thanks to the artificially inflated values of their homes.In turn, that should mean less pressure to build freeways and lower long-term expenses to maintain those freeways.; 0
0150.00031; There are also environmental benefits since people won't have to travel so far to get to work fossil fuel consumption is reduced, and with that, so are auto emissions. Theoretically, both sides benefit in any deal, but sometimes some benefit more than others.; 0
0150.00032; Those are the rent-seekers who enjoy the benefits of government policies.; 0
0150.00033; Those selling homes will certainly benefit thanks to the artificially inflated values of their homes.; 0
0150.00034; The real estate business may benefit because of higher commissions.; 0

0155.00001; Exclusive  By Chris Vedelago, Farrah Tomazin and Debbie Cuthbertson The Catholic Church in Victoria is facing at least 800 new legal actions for child sexual abuse in the wake of landmark legislation allowing victims to sue the church and revisit unfair settlements made under in-house compensation schemes.; 0
0155.00002; The state government's decision to abolish the so-called Ellis defence ended the church's long-standing immunity to lawsuits and opened a floodgate of new claims that is threatening the financial stability of religious organisations around the state.; 0
0155.00003; A man who has recently lodged a legal action against the Catholic Church for historical sexual abuse.Credit:Darrian Traynor  Data collated by The Age and based on case files from eight law firms dealing in institutional abuse found an unprecedented number of legal claims are now before the courts or being drafted on behalf of victims of the clergy. Among them are lawsuits in the Victorian Supreme Court seeking compensation for abuse by convicted paedophile priests, including Gerald Ridsdale and Paul David Ryan.; 0
0155.00004; At least one action has been filed against George Pell.; 0
0155.00005; Pell is seeking to appeal to the High Court against his criminal conviction over the abuse of a choirboy. Advertisement  Hundreds more survivors are preparing claims for compensation to be lodged against the Archdiocese of Melbourne, including cases of child rape at Corpus Christi seminary, as well as the dioceses of Sale, Sandhurst and Ballarat, the Christian Brothers and Marists.; 0
0155.00006; Loading  Some of the claims include allegations that church figures ignored or covered up criminal conduct by priests and religious brothers. Others are planning to use new state laws that allow courts to overturn historical compensation payments by setting aside so-called deeds of release.; 0
0155.00007; These were agreements that forced victims to sign away their rights to take further legal action when they accepted capped payouts through church compensation schemes such as the Melbourne Response. Some of the claims could be heard in Supreme Court trials, but the vast majority are expected to be settled out of court.; 0
0155.00008; The deluge of legal action will have massive financial implications for the church, which is already struggling with operating losses, ballooning debt and declining parishioner numbers.; 0
0155.00009; In Melbourne, Archbishop Peter Comensoli has been forced to sack administrative staff and restructure the church's head office in a bid to keep his budget on track. But there are also implications for victims, who now face significant delays processing their claims. Instead of having to go cap-in-hand to the church and negotiate an outcome, there is now a level playing field.; 0
0155.00010; Vivian Waller from Waller Legal  Solicitor Judy Courtin said in some cases it could take six months or longer for victims to get appointments with specialist doctors and psychiatrists, which are needed to assess the extent of a person's injuries and potential damages claim.; 0
0155.00011; Once a matter is filed, it could also take 12 to 15 months to get a trial date.; 0
0155.00012; The delays are very concerning, particularly for older survivors, she said.; 0
0155.00013; The Melbourne Archdiocese declined to comment on its financial exposure to the legal actions. But The Age has previously revealed the church owns about $9 billion in property across Victoria, although many of these assets are in the form of heritage-listed churches, or properties being used as schools, nursing homes or outreach facilities.; 0

0155.00015; The Diocese of Sale said claims for compensation have put it under financial pressure similar to many other religious organisations around the country.; 0
0155.00016; The Diocese regularly reviews its liabilities, both current and, as far as possible, forecast future claims, and then carefully budgets to meet its obligations, Bishop Patrick O'Regan said. Figures from the Christian Brothers' Australian wing show it has already spent more than $213 million on victims' payouts and legal expenses in the past six years, with the order expecting to outlay at least another $134 million in the future.; 1
0155.00017; The bishop of Sale, Pat O'Regan. Solicitor Vivian Waller, who represented the choirboy in the criminal case against Pell, said her firm, Waller Legal, is now pursuing 315 claims against Catholic organisations in Victoria.; 0
0155.00018; This included representing 81 former child victims of the Archdiocese of Melbourne. She said the legislative changes were directly responsible for the recent wave of litigation.; 0
0155.00019; Instead of having to go cap-in-hand to the church and negotiate an outcome, there is now a level playing field where the church has to address these cases on their merits.; 0
0155.00020; Some survivors have told The Age they felt empowered to take action in the wake of the Pell verdict, and in particular, after the Royal Commission Into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse.; 0
0155.00021; Others say they simply want justice. The reason I'm doing it is accountability, said one man who was sexually abused by a cleric as a minor, and whose matter is now before the courts.; 0
0155.00022; They actually don't care. Between the '60s and '90s and the current day, they actually forgot about parishioners. And they forgot about the kids.; 0

0155.00025; Credit:Leanne Pickett  The spike in legal action also suggests that some abuse survivors are shunning the federal government's National Redress Scheme, which provides victims with a maximum of $150,000 but has been widely criticised for only doing so in extreme cases.; 0
0155.00026; Loading  Federal government figures show that, as of August 30, the scheme had received more than 4800 applications, but had only made 512 redress payments with an average payment amount of $79,700.; 0

0157.00001; Wednesday, 18 September 2019  Hellenic Navy  -  Brief analysis of the current situation of the Fleet and its future   Written by D-Mitch  Photos by   The Hellenic Navy in exercise  Today, the Hellenic Navy maintains a large number of surface combatants and submarines in its inventory. However, the shortfalls suffered by the Navy over the last several years from the severe economic recession that began in mid-2008, are significant.; 0
0157.00002; Τhe economic crisis hit hard the country and Greece tried to recover via spending cuts including a high proportion of the defence budget. The vast majority of the warships in active service today are very old and should had been replaced by modern designs at least a decade ago. Having been held back by the pressures of the global economic crisis, the Hellenic Navy is now racing to catch up with its neighbors ( ).; 0
0157.00003; Greece is a country with vast coastline, archipelagos and enclaves, heavily depended on trade and on the exploitation of maritime resource.; 0
0157.00004; However, trade and economic issues depend considerably on the free use of the sea, on the security of the sea lines of communication and the sustainable exploitation of marine resources.; 0
0157.00005; Greece is a maritime nation by tradition, as shipping is arguably the oldest form of occupation of the Greeks and has been a key element of Greek economic activity since ancient times. Today, shipping is the country's most important industry worth $21.9 billion in 2018.; 1
0157.00006; ( ) The responsibility of the Hellenic Navy in this respect is certainly huge.; 0
0157.00007; To a large extent, the future of Greece depends on the control exercised on the sea. To continue being effective, the Fleet must be a powerful, balanced and flexible instrument at the service of Greece in this uncertain and ever-changing geostrategic environment.; 0
0157.00008; It is vital for the Navy to continue having the necessary means to solve the most complex and demanding situations and constantly protecting and surveilling the maritime domains of national interest.; 0
0157.00009; In this article the most important facts about the current situation of the Fleet and its (possible) future are reported.; 0
0157.00010; Finally, one graph depict the current fleet composition and its future composition by 2030 in two scenarios, optimistic (O) and pessimistic (P).; 0
0157.00011; A second graph depicts the years of active service of the newest and oldest vessel per warship type. FRIGATES   Hydra class frigate  The 70% of the vessels have trainable anti-aircraft missile launching system.; 0
0157.00012; ( ) The oldest ship in the class is 41 years old (Kountouriotis, commissioned in 1978) while the youngest ship is 21 years old (Salamis, commissioned in 1998).; 0
0157.00013; ( ) None of the ships is equipped with remote weapon station (RWS) for the purpose of asymmetric warfare and coastal defense.; 0
0157.00014; The electronic counter measures systems (ECM) are absent or very old.; 0
0157.00015; Raytheon will begin soon the installation of new electro-optical systems on the ships that have not such sensors.; 0
0157.00016; ( ) The Kortenaer/Elli class frigates need to be replaced by new designs while the Hydra class frigates need modernization and if possible upgrade in specific weapon systems. It is certain that Hydras will follow a modernization programme but it is not known yet its scale.; 0
0157.00017; The systems will be replaced on the ships are definitely the CMS, ESM, navigation radars, engines and the long-range air and surface surveillance radar.; 0
0157.00018; Hydras will serve in the '30s as well. FDI frigate for the Hellenic Navy   MMSC frigate for the Hellenic Navy  There are negotiations to acquire 2+2 Naval Group FDI frigates from France ( ) while the Americans propose the acquisition of 4 MMSC ( ).; 0
0157.00019; Few countries today can replace such a large number of vessels with just one type or under a common shipbuilding programme. It is almost certain that two types will replace the Ellis except if only one of the procurements will take place, thus only new 4 vessels plus two old Ellis (those with new electric engines) in order to maintain 10 frigates.; 0
0157.00020; Another suitable option is to procure corvettes to replace a number of old Kortenaers.; 0
0157.00021; Second hand warships such as the recently modernized Dutch and Belgian Karel Doorman frigates could be a good interim solution, after modernizing them with the installation of ESSM, new radars and CIWS.; 0
0157.00022; All Greek frigates carry Harpoon missiles.; 0
0157.00023; These missiles need upgrade.; 0
0157.00024; Note that Greece participates in NATO-led ESSM consortium. The Navy must procure ESSM Block 2 and to equip fully the Hydras.; 0
0157.00025; SUBMARINES   Papanikolis (Type 214) class submarine  The oldest submarine in the fleet is 47yrs old while the newest is only 3yrs old. The newest Type 209 submarine is.. 40yrs old!; 0
0157.00026; The new Type 214s (Papanikolis class) need new torpedoes. More likely the procurement will take place in the very near future.; 0
0157.00027; ( ) The 6 old and non-modernized Type 209s will be gradually retired without any replacement announced yet. In May 2011 HDW cancelled the contract for the additional two Type 214 vessels in response to bribery allegations involving Abu Dhabi Mar, which became the majority shareholder of Hellenic Shipyards in 2010.; 0
0157.00028; ( ) The most logical decision the next years is the acquisition of 2-3 boats of a new Type 214 variant.; 0
0157.00029; This is the optimistic scenario of 8 submarines. By 2030, the sole Type 209/1500 AIP (Okeanos, former Type 209/1200) will have exceeded the 50 years of active service therefore it is more than questionable, whether will still be part of the Greek fleet by that time.( ) By 2030, the Navy should begin a modernization programme for the Type 214s.; 0
0157.00030; FAST ATTACK MISSILE CRAFT   Roussen class fast attack missile craft  There are two Roussen class FACM under construction one will be commissioned by the end of 2019 or in the beginning of 2020 after a +10-year delay due to financial problems. The 6th Roussen boat will be the newest in the current Fleet. There are no changes in the design despite there about 20 years since the first vessel in the class entered the water.; 0
0157.00031; ( ) The majority of the FAC are built in the late '70s.; 0
0157.00032; Four of them have been modernized extensively.( ) The oldest ship, an S148 class boat, is 46yrs old.; 0
0157.00033; However the two of the active S148s carry no missiles and operate as patrol boats. Nevertheless, they are included in the FACM fleet.; 0
0157.00034; Perhaps they can receive old MM38s if are still operational.; 0
0157.00035; All the old vessels, except the three S148s which are about to be retired soon with the introduction of the new Roussens, have replaced or will replace soon their old MM38 and Penguin missile systems with Harpoon launchers from retired frigates and destroyers. ( ) The boats that have no Mirador sensor will receive a new Miltech system.; 0
0157.00036; ( ) It is questionable if Harpoons in the current inventory are plenty enough to equip all the Laskos and Kavaloudis boats. The Navy should procure new Harpoons or to install the systems from retired Ellis with the introduction into service of modern frigates equipped with more advanced missiles.; 0
0157.00037; The Navy should modernize the existing Exocet missile stock to homogenize the entire MM40 missile fleet.; 0
0157.00038; The new MM40 Block 3C variant should be procured. The Navy must equip all the Roussens with RAM Block 2 missiles and thus to increase their survivability.; 0
0157.00039; The Navy must procure new ships of an advanced stealth design to replace the old Combattantes and to have at least 15-strong FACM fleet.; 0
0157.00040; The torpedo launchers from the Combattantes could equip the Roussens increasing their lethality.; 0
0157.00041; TANK LANDING SHIPS   Jason class landing ship  The oldest Jason class vessel is already 25yrs old.; 0
0157.00042; The Jasons need urgently modernization that will include new sensors, new CMS, new LCVPs, ESM, improvements on their secondary guns, etc.( ) The procurement of the STRALES system could increase the survivability of the ships. It is significant the absence of Assault Amphibious Vehicle or else Marine Fighting Vehicle (such as AAVP-7, BMP-3F etc.) in the inventory of the Hellenic Armed Forces.; 0
0157.00043; Perhaps one of the oldest vessels will be retired in the coming years and used to support the rest of the vessels. MINEHUNTERS   Hunt class minehunter.; 0
0157.00044; Photo: Hellenic Navy  The minehunter fleet needs modernization. The Hunt class vessels are about 34yrs old. The Royal Navy has modernized its Hunt class extensively while has upgrade their capabilities with new minehunting equipment.; 0
0157.00045; Lithuania followed a similar programme for its vessels.; 0
0157.00046; The Hellenic Navy should pursue such a modernization programme in cooperation with the Royal Navy. ( ) The Hellenic Navy should pursue the acquisition of two retired vessels from the Royal Navy, Atherstone and Quorn. The two boats could operate periodically as patrol vessels.; 0
0157.00047; LARGE GUNBOATS   Machitis class gunboat  With the exception of the Machitis class gunboats, the rest of the boats need modernization and some of them replacement.; 0
0157.00048; ( ) The Asheville class boats are obsolete and extremely old (50 yrs old).; 0
0157.00049; The Navy needs urgently at least two new boats with the same or even superior capabilities than the current Machitis boats, to replace the old Ashevilles. Possibly two of the old S148s can be an interim solution.The Navy operate them as such today. The rest four boats (Osprey 55 and HSY 56) will receive or have already received new electro-optical systems.; 0
0157.00050; ( ) An upgrade of the OTO Melara gun mounts with the installation of STRALES systems should be examined. PATROL COASTAL BOATS   Nasty class patrol coastal boats.; 0
0157.00051; Photo: Hellenic Navy  The coastal patrol boats are either former torpedo boats or small missile boats. Some of the oldest boats in the Navy are included in this category.; 0
0157.00052; The oldest vessel is 53yrs old while the youngest..; 0
0157.00053; 44! The Navy should procure new boats and to replace all or at least the majority of the current ones.; 0
0157.00054; The new boat should be able to operate in shallow waters, to be easy to maintain and command. RWS, modern sensors, and possibly short-range missile systems should be included in their equipment.; 0
0157.00055; The Hellenic Coast Guard will receive new armed coastal patrol boats. Perhaps the best solution could be a design based on that platform or to reconsider the coastal patrol duties for the Navy.; 0
0157.00056; ( )  REPLENISHMENT SHIPS   Prometheus replenishment ship  The youngest replenishment ship, Prometheus, is currently the largest ship in the Greek fleet. The installation of a second weapon system atop the helicopter hangar, as it was planned initially, would increase the survivability of the most capable replenishment ship in the Fleet.; 0
0157.00057; A second vessel of similar capabilities with the newest one is required in order to retire the 50-yrs old Lüneburgs and therefore to have two large replenishment ships by 2030. Italian ships that will retire in the near future could replace the Lüneburgs.; 0
0157.00058; LANDING HOVERCRAFT   Kerkyra, the most modern vessel among the Zubrs  Two of the four initially boats are currently active while a third one is periodically active.; 0
0157.00059; The fourth one is unlikely that will enter service again.; 0
0157.00060; Their support is problematic and it is questionable if all of them will remain in active service for long time.; 0
0157.00061; ( ) The fourth and most modern vessel in the LCAC fleet will certainly remain in active service for many years to come, perhaps by using spare parts from the rest of the boats.; 0
0157.00062; AIRCRAFT   S-70 Aegean Hawk  Recently, the U.S. State Department cleared a possible $600 million foreign military sale of seven MH-60R Seahawk multi-mission helicopters to Greece.; 0
0157.00063; If all the helicopters will be acquired then they will replace an equal number of AB212s which are about 35yrs old.; 0
0157.00064; ( ) A decision was taken in 2014 for the re-activation of existing P-3Bs and their submission to a program of overhaul, upgrade and service life extension.

0161.00001; MarketWatch photo illustration/iStockphoto  By  Over the past several years, much has been said about blockchain's potential to fix a myriad of issues from money transfers, to digital voting, to supply chain management, to land title transfers.; 0
0161.00002; However, one of the most compelling use cases for this technology is how it will change capital markets. Throughout my career, I've witnessed time and again how outdated processes can bring trading to a grinding halt or how complicated it can be for start-ups to raise money.; 0
0161.00003; I received a call from my team around lunchtime one Friday during the summer of 2018.; 0
0161.00004; The operations person at the large bank holding the shares for our client had left early for the weekend.; 0
0161.00005; Before he left, he forgot to release the shares for settlement of the equity offering we had placed earlier in the week. We had to borrow the shares in the open market to complete the settlement.; 0
0161.00006; The situation left me wondering how large financial transactions could still be derailed by a single person taking a summer Friday off.; 0
0161.00007; And this was not the first time in my decade-long career on Wall Street that a human error left a team scrambling to execute a transaction. I cannot count the number of times I have told companies that we don't know how many of their shareholders there are because the limited ownership disclosure requirements and lack of technology do not provide that type of clarity with any degree of certainty and timeliness. There are dozens more examples of frictions, inefficiencies, costs and opportunities for human error and mischief in the business of trading securities, but one of the most significant is that equity trades still take three days to settle (T+2).; 0
0161.00008; In 2019, it still takes days to match the shares, move the cash and make sure the buyer and seller's accounts are updated.; 0
0161.00009; Fortunately, we are on the cusp of an evolution in capital markets.; 0
0161.00010; We are still in the early days of the financial sector's adoption of blockchain technology and the digitalization of securities, but they will fundamentally change the way capital markets function. Within five years I expect the average individual investor will have access to assets currently reserved just for the ultra-wealthy or connected, such as private limited partnerships, hedge funds, pre-IPO securities and many others.; 0
0161.00011; Blockchain technologies allow companies to create digital securities called tokens that are more flexible and nuanced from a financial-engineering perspective and are embedded with data (including regulatory compliance rules) that used to require significant manual work to confirm. As a result, illiquid assets and securities that up until now required too many costly hours with bankers and lawyers to verify and make compliant for trading become viable for liquidity.; 0
0161.00012; Settlement of digital trades can happen within seconds without human intervention  -  so no more risk of someone's summer Friday ruining a trade.; 0
0161.00013; In addition, companies can gain much greater visibility into their shareholder bases and better manage their relationship with their investors.; 0
0161.00014; Security tokens are ideal for trading assets that are currently illiquid or traded privately  -  from fine art to automobiles to master limited partnerships (MLPs), for example. Even lightly traded stocks will undergo tokenization.; 0
0161.00015; Security tokens will represent the next generation of how the world will trade and determine value.; 0
0161.00016; As retail broker-dealers are approved to trade digital assets by regulators, individual investors will be able to purchase and trade security tokens directly on their computers and smartphones, just as they now trade stocks and bonds. More on blockchain:  The roots of this transition have already started to take hold within capital markets.; 0
0161.00017; Besides the increasing interest in security token offerings, companies are trying to bypass the opaque Wall Street IPO and capital raising processes through crowdfunding and pursuing direct stock listings, like Google GOOG, -0.17% GOOGL, -0.14% more than a decade ago and, more recently, Spotify SPOT, +0.71%. Issuers recognize the archaic financial industry, with intermediary-heavy processes that no longer make sense in the 21st century. Now there's something they can do about it.; 0
0161.00018; While we are in the early stages of this revolution, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin BTCUSD, -0.51% and ether have put blockchain on the map. Eventually it will cover the entire globe. Our markets will still be recognizable  -  stocks will be quoted and traded like stocks, bonds like bonds, oil like oil  -  but the democratization of participation and the real-time processing of trades enabled by tokenization will change everything just the same.; 0

0162.00001; REWARDS CANADA'S TOP FEATURES With the sad news that Chase Canada left our market and  discontinued two of Canada's favourite No Foreign Transaction fee cards we were being bombarded with questions on which cards still offer this benefit. First off, for those who are unaware, most credit and charge cards in Canada charge a fee for making purchases in a currency that is not Canadian dollars. This fee, known as the Foreign Transaction Fee is charged over and above the actual exchange rate.; 0
0162.00002; The good thing is credit card companies (Visa, Mastercard, Amex) tend to have extremely good exchange rates compared to banks and currency conversion outlets.; 0
0162.00003; Secondly, we should let you know that there aren't many that do and there is a big reason why.; 0
0162.00004; We explain in the following article of ours as to why: True No Foreign Transaction Fee Cards Currently these are the only cards in Canada that have No Foreign Transaction Fees on all purchases: All of the above cards do have rewards programs attached to them that also provide rewards in the 1% to 2% range which is pretty decent considering you aren't paying any forex fees!; 0
0162.00005; As well the Brim Cards have pretty decent insurance packages included for the fee based cards and so does the HSBC Premier World Elite Mastercard. Cards like the Scotiabank Passport Visa Infinite card not only have the no Forex Fee but have great insurance and includes an awesome Priority Pass package. Cards that charge a foreign transaction fee but provide higher reward returns You have other options outside the above cards if you have a mix of Canadian spending and foreign spending and want to funnel your points into one account or need benefits that aren't included with any of the cards listed above.; 0
0162.00006; Also note that we only take into account full time earn rates and did not include cards that may offer limited time higher earn rates as an introductory offer.; 0
0162.00007; Remember  there are many more steps to choosing a credit card other than just the foreign transaction fee unless you have other cards in your portfolio and want one strictly for this reason.; 0

0166.00002; It provides temporary life insurance protection on a limited budget. Here's how it works:  When a policyholder buys term insurance, he or she buys coverage for a specific period and pays a specific price for that coverage.; 0

0167.00004; Governance concerns are seen as a continued risk, but investors may soon focus on a more immediate threat: Dilutive triggers built into We's capital structure will pose problems when the company again attempts to tap public markets.; 0
0167.00005; The trouble started when We's value began to fall.; 0
0167.00006; Its last fundraising round in the private markets gave it an implied valuation of $47 billion. The company lowered its sights to a of around $20 billion and last week that went lower still.; 0
0167.00007; The Wall Street Journal reported the startup was looking to issue shares implying a valuation as low as $15 billion.; 0
0167.00008; We desperately needs capital to continue to progress on its current growth path.; 0
0167.00009; Earlier this year it signed up for a $6 billion credit facility. As part of the deal, We agreed to make the facility contingent on it raising $3 billion of equity. The debt deal is an all or nothing proposition: It only comes if We successfully raises $3 billion.; 1
0167.00010; In other words, at least $9 billion in funding will or won't materialize if an IPO happens.; 1
0167.00011; That would make it significantly more painful for the loss-making company to walk away from the IPO if sentiment or market conditions are unfavorable. But that can kick off a vicious cycle.; 0
0167.00012; As We's valuation falls, it needs to issue ever more shares to reach the $3 billion mark.; 1
0167.00013; , a $3 billion capital raise is just a sliver of the company.; 0
0167.00014; At a $15 billion or $20 billion valuation, though, it dilutes existing shareholders far more.; 0
0167.00015; That isn't all. Venture capital providers often protect themselves with something called a down round provision. These stipulations give insiders extra stock in the event that a future fundraising is set below the valuation they last awarded a company.; 0
0167.00016; In this case, downside protection for early backers appears to take the form of a $1 billion convertible note that changes into equity on the last day of this year. The note is held by major shareholder SoftBank, according to We's regulatory filings.; 0
0167.00017; We's prospectus offers only a vague price for the conversion, so it is impossible to tell exactly how much or whether shareholders will be diluted, says Nori Gerardo Lietz, senior lecturer of business administration at Harvard Business School in an unpublished paper seen by The Wall Street Journal. But because the conversion appears to happen after the IPO, buyers of its shares in the offering could take a hit.; 0
0167.00018; Features like these can cause a downward spiral.; 0
0167.00019; As the offering gets ever more dilutive, the valuation falls.; 0
0167.00020; As the valuation falls, the offering becomes more dilutive.; 0
0167.00021; Both SoftBank and We have reason to restructure these features if they make raising cash too difficult, but that also takes time which We may not have.; 0
0167.00022; A final squeeze on the company is that it will lose its status as an emerging company under the JOBS Act by the end of this year, which would make the IPO process even more cumbersome.; 0
0167.00023; The act allows the company to use more lenient reporting standards about its finances and executive compensation - a potential problem for a company already dogged by governance concerns. Companies rarely strike good deals with their backs to a wall.; 0
0168.00001; Openwork  By Rachel Mortimer  Openwork gained 262 advisers last year as the advice network continued its recruitment drive and focus on the company's academy programme.; 1
0168.00002; In its financial results for 2018 published today (September 17) Openwork announced the number of advisers across its network hit 3,865 last year alongside an 11 per cent increase in assets on its platform to £6.9bn.; 0
0168.00003; Assets under management at Openwork have continued to grow into this year hitting £8bn in July as the network reported a growing demand for advice.; 1
0168.00004; The network has been vocal about its recruitment focus as part of its expansion, announcing in June it was set to have the best six months for recruitment in a decade.; 0
0168.00005; In today's announcement the business reported a record intake to its adviser academy so far this year, gaining 54 trainees to the scheme, almost equalling the total intake in 2018.; 0
0168.00006; Openwork reported a 18.3 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to £22.6m for 2018, its seventh year of profit growth allowing the network to pay its first dividend to shareholders totalling £2m.; 1
0168.00007; Mark Duckworth, chief executive, said 2019 was a significant year for the business when it became an independent business in April.; 0
0168.00008; He said: It is therefore very pleasing to be able to report strong results whilst also investing in the future. We are growing the scale of our advice business across our diversified offering and this has meant we have been able to help more clients than ever.; 0
0168.00009; That is enabling us to invest in our academy to develop more advisers, as well as in our front-end systems to enable our advisers to serve our clients more effectively.; 0
0168.00010; The record intake to the Openwork Academy in particular underlines our commitment to increase access to advice so more people across the UK can receive the expert help they need to create and protect wealth for themselves and their families. Mr Duckworth said this would remain a strategic priority for the business throughout 2019 and beyond.; 0
0168.00011; Openwork also saw growth in its mortgage business last year, an area it has previously eyed for expansion alongside protection, with lending increasing by 21 per cent to £16.4bn.  Mr Duckworth said: Our strengthened financial position has meant we have been able to reward our long-standing and supportive shareholders with the first ever dividend. I would like to thank the growing team at Openwork, our advisers, colleagues and senior management, for the hard work and dedication which has made 2018 a success and look forward to the continued development of our business.; 0

0171.00002; No.; 0
0171.00003; The income you receive from your 401(k) or other qualified retirement plan does not affect the amount of Social Security retirement benefits you receive each month. However, you may be required to pay taxes on some or all of your benefits if your annual income exceeds a certain threshold - and your 401(k) distributions can cause it to do that.; 0
0171.00004; Social Security retirement benefit income does not change based on other retirement income, such as from 401(k) plan funds. Social Security income, instead, is calculated by your lifetime earnings and the age at which you elect to start taking Social Security benefits.; 0
0171.00005; Distributions from a 401(k), however, may increase your total annual income to a point that your Social Security income will be subject to taxes.; 0
0171.00006; Why Doesn't 401(k) Income Affect Social Security?; 0
0171.00007; Your Social Security benefits are determined by the amount of money you earned during your working years - years in which you paid into the system via Social Security taxes.; 0
0171.00008; Since contributions to your 401(k) are made with compensation received from employment by a U.S. company, you have already paid Social Security taxes on those dollars.; 0

0171.00010; You still pay Social Security taxes on the full amount of your compensation in the year you earned it. Contributions to a 401(k) are subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes, but are not subject to income taxes, unless you are making a Roth (after-tax) contribution, notes Mark Hebner, founder and president of Index Fund Advisors Inc. in Irvine, Calif., and author of Index Funds: The 12-Step Recovery Program for Active Investors. In a nutshell, this is why you owe income tax on 401(k) distributions when you take them, but not any Social Security tax.; 0
0171.00011; And the amount of your Social Security benefit is not affected by your 401(k) taxable income. The Tax Impact of 401(k) Savings Often, you don't owe taxes on Social Security benefits, for the reason described above: You paid your dues during your working years.; 0
0171.00012; But you may have to pay income taxes on some of your benefits if your combined annual income exceeds a certain amount.; 0
0171.00013; The income thresholds are based on your combined income, which is equal to the sum of your adjusted gross income (AGI), which includes earned wages, withdrawals from any retirement savings accounts (like IRA and 401(k)s), any non-taxed interest earned, and one-half of your Social Security benefits.; 0
0171.00014; If you take large distributions from your traditional 401(k) in any given year that you receive benefits - and remember, you're required to start taking them from all 401(k)s once you turn 70½ - you are more likely to exceed the income threshold and increase your tax liability for the year. According to the Social Security Administration, in 2019, if your total income for the year is less than $25,000 and you file as an individual, you won't be required to pay taxes on any portion of your Social Security benefits.; 0
0171.00015; If you file jointly as a married couple, this limit is raised to $32,000.; 1
0171.00016; You may be required to pay taxes on up to 50% of your benefits if you are an individual with income between $25,000 and $34,000, or if you file jointly and have income between $32,000 and $44,000.; 1
0171.00017; Up to 85% of your benefits may be taxable if you are single and earn more than $34,000 or if you are married and earn more than $44,000.; 1
0171.00018; If you are married but file a separate return, you are likely to be liable for income tax on the total amount of your benefits, regardless of your income level. In some cases, other types of retirement income may affect your benefit amount, even if you collect benefits on your spouse's account.; 0
0171.00019; Your benefits may be reduced to account for the income you receive from a pension, based on earnings from a government job or from another job for which your earnings were not subject to Social Security taxes.; 0
0171.00020; This primarily affects people working in state or local government positions, the federal civil service, or those who have worked for a foreign company.; 0
0171.00021; If you work in a government position and receive a pension for work not subject to Social Security taxes, your Social Security benefits received as a spouse or widow or widower are reduced by two-thirds of the amount of the pension.; 1
0171.00022; This rule is called the government pension offset (GPO).; 0
0171.00023; For example, if you are eligible to receive $1,200 in Social Security but also receive $900 per month from a government pension, your Social Security benefits are reduced by $600 to account for your pension income.; 1
0171.00024; This means your Social Security benefit amount is reduced to $600, and your total monthly income is $1,500. The windfall elimination provision (WEP) reduces the unfair advantage given to those who receive benefits on their own account and receive income from a pension based on earnings for which they did not pay Social Security taxes.; 0
0171.00025; In these cases, the WEP simply reduces Social Security benefits by a certain factor, depending on the age and birth date of the applicant.; 0
0171.00026; What Determines Your Social Security Benefit?; 0
0171.00027; Your Social Security benefit amount is largely determined by how much you earned during your working years, your age when you retire, and your expected lifespan.; 0
0171.00028; The first factor that influences your benefit amount is the average amount that you earned while working.; 0
0171.00029; Essentially, the more you earned, the higher your benefits will be.; 0
0171.00030; The SSA's annual fact sheet shows workers retiring at full retirement age will receive a maximum benefit amount of $2,861 for 2019. The Social Security Administration calculates an average monthly benefit amount based on your average income and the number of years you are expected to live.; 0
0171.00031; In addition to these factors, your age when you retire also plays a crucial role in determining your benefit amount.; 0
0171.00032; While you can begin receiving Social Security benefits as early as age 62, your benefit amount is reduced for each month that you begin collecting before your full retirement age. (Full retirement age is 66 and six months for those who turn 62 in 2019. It increases by two months each year until it hits 67 for anyone born in 1960 or after, the full retirement age will be 67.); 0
0171.00033; Conversely, your benefit amount may be increased if you continue to work and delay receiving benefits beyond full retirement age.; 0
0171.00034; For example, in 2019, the maximum monthly benefit amount for those retiring at full retirement age is $2,861.; 0
0171.00035; For those retiring early, at age 62, the maximum drops to $2,209, while those who wait until age 70 - the latest you can defer - can collect a benefit of $3,770 per month.; 1
0171.00036; Income from a 401(k) does not affect the amount of your Social Security benefits, but it can boost your annual income to a point where they will be taxed, or taxed at a higher rate. This can be a conundrum for someone who's at an age where they're required both to start withdrawing from the 401(k) and to start collecting Social Security.; 0
0171.00037; Make sure you are aware of annual changes to Social Security income thresholds and factor in tax liabilities when planning for retirement or deciding how big a 401(k) distribution to take.; 0

0174.00001; Preface: Explaining our market timing models  We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The Ultimate Market Timing Model is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, Building the ultimate market timing model. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.; 0
0174.00002; The Trend Model is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price.; 0
0174.00003; This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year.; 0
0174.00004; In essence, it seeks to answer the question, Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)? My inner trader uses a trading model, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa).; 0

0177.00001; September 11, 2019 Europe, Featured News, Switzerland  Share  Tweet  Share  Reddit  WhatsApp  By Davide Anghileri, University of Lausanne On 1 September, the voters of Switzerland's canton of Zurich endorsed a cantonal tax reform bill with a 56% majority as a consequence of the approval of the Swiss corporate tax reform in May.; 1
0177.00002; The federal law, which will enter into force as of 1 January 2020, requires the cantons to implement the new measures into their cantonal tax laws and ensure conformity with the federal regulations.; 0
0177.00003; To remain attractive as a business location and to respect the new international tax environment, the Canton of Zurich will reduce its cantonal tax rate and will introduce new tax measures.; 0
0177.00004; The cantonal tax regimes such as holding company, mixed company, and domicile company are abolished. As a consequence of this abolition, specific transitional rules will be available for companies that will lose their preferential cantonal tax regimes. Hence, during a transition period of 5 years, the realization of hidden reserves (including original goodwill) can be taxed separately with a lower special tax rate of 0.5% if such income would not have been taxable under the old law.; 1
0177.00005; As a precondition for the application of this special tax rate, the respective hidden reserves must be reported for within time.; 0
0177.00006; Alternatively, companies that are currently subject to special taxation in the canton of Zurich have the possibility to voluntarily waive their cantonal tax privilege until December 31.; 0
0177.00007; In this case, due to cantonal tax practice. a corporate income tax free step-up of hidden reserves (including original goodwill) is available followed by a tax-effective amortization with a maximum amortization period of 10 years.; 0
0177.00008; However, depreciation is subject to the overall limitation of 70% of the tax relief. Also, the stepped-up hidden reserves are subject to cantonal capital tax until the cantonal provisions of Swiss corporate tax reform enter into force.; 0
0177.00009; Canton Zurich patent box and R&D expenses An OECD-compliant patent box regime will be introduced.; 0
0177.00010; This measure grants a tax relief at the cantonal level of a maximum of 90% of the income resulting from patents and similar rights related to Swiss incurred research and development expenditures.; 0
0177.00011; Moreover, an increased tax deduction of a maximum 50% of the effective research and development expenses incurred in Switzerland will be granted.; 0
0177.00012; The cantonal regime states that the additional deduction is allowed only for R&D expenses incurred in Switzerland directly by the company or indirectly through third parties in Switzerland.; 0
0177.00013; As of January 1, 2021, the corporate income tax rate will be reduced from the current 8% to 7%. As a result, the effective tax burden for an ordinarily taxed company in the canton of Zurich with domicile in the city of Zurich will be reduced from currently 21.1% to 19.1% (federal, cantonal, and community tax calculation based on profit before taxes and current conditions).; 1
0177.00014; Furthermore, the cantonal council aims to reduce the corporate income tax rate from 7% to 6% as of January 1, 2023.  The Canton Zurich tax reform introduces a notional interest deduction on surplus equity. For the cantonal law, surplus equity includes equity capital which, in the long term, exceeds the equity capital required for business operations. The cantonal tax law provides that at least 30% of the net earnings (taxable profit before deduction of tax loss carryforwards and excluding net participation income from qualified participations) must be subject to taxation on the cantonal level.; 0
0177.00015; Therefore, the maximum cantonal tax relief is set at 70%.  The capital tax on equity relating to investments, patents, and similar intangibles as well as intercompany loans will also be reduced under the Canton Zurich tax reform. Consequently, taxable equity attributable to qualifying investments, loans to group companies, and qualifying intellectual property will be reduced by 90%.

0186.00023; We wanted to grow our ecosystem, develop a massive reach for transaction and content distribution, power a new business model, and drive innovation.; 0
0186.00024; Basically, we wanted to use APIs to transform our business into a platform, and we wanted to build an ecosystem that leveraged this API platform to develop new solutions.; 0
0186.00025; Our leadership also understood the importance of delivering information to our customers in the way they wanted to consume it. Our customers had told us that they didn't want software, they just wanted access to the data - and APIs are the easiest, most secure way to grant that access.; 0
0186.00026; The Apigee API management platform as an enterprise solution We knew we needed an API management platform to enable this step forward. In addition to the documentation and discoverability, we also wanted a place to create APIs fast, and where we could get visibility into usage and other metrics. The Apigee API management platform from Google Cloud offered all of this, and more.; 0
0186.00027; From the robust feature set to advanced security to the developer portal to analytics  -  Apigee provides us everything we need to run an enterprise-class API program.; 0
0186.00028; Now that we have our API program up and running, integrations no longer take months. In some cases, it's just a matter of minutes or seconds.; 0
0186.00029; Customers can simply look at our documentation on how to invoke APIs and begin consuming data in seconds.; 0
0186.00030; We started with this new model in our three largest markets: North America, the United Kingdom and Brazil.; 0
0186.00031; Later, we rolled it out to Singapore and Australia, while deploying an on-premises platform for some of our North American business units that needed to provide their APIs internally only. Next, we went to EMEA. At this point, we've deployed Apigee company-wide, giving us a flexible deployment model that maintains a centralized platform and processes.; 0
0186.00032; We continue to evangelize the program today, and we recently conducted a workshop with the Apigee team to train our EMEA business unit and get them onboarded to the platform. They were able to start developing API proxies right away, and they're set to go into production with as many as nine of them. We also went live with three developer portals, which we call API hubs, in North America, the United Kingdom, and Brazil.; 0
0186.00033; As we expand, we don't want to keep building up different developer portals for each region because then we're going to have too many. Alternatively, we plan to combine them into a single global developer portal that will allow users to select geographies of interest where they'll be presented with relevant information.; 0
0186.00034; Experian continues to evolve the types of products and services we offer.; 0

0187.00001; B.C.'s speculation tax is increasing housing stock and generating revenue for housing creation, Finance Minister Carole James said Sept. 12.; 0
0187.00002; The tax was created to address the ongoing affordability crisis in the province's major urban centres where real estate has been subject to speculation and allegedly used for laundering illegal funds. When we formed government two years ago, we really were at the peak of a housing crisis, James said. The tax is working as we intended.; 0
0187.00003; Critics, however, want to see more data and question James' claims that the results have been positive.; 0

The average assessed home value of properties subject to the tax is $1.45 million while the average assessed value of properties exempt from the tax in the taxable areas is $1.1 million, ministry data said.; 0
0187.00008; And, James warned, an audit of those exempted from the tax will ensure no one is avoiding paying their legal share.; 0

0187.00013; James said the tax rate on foreign owners and satellite families will increase in 2019.; 0
0187.00014; For 2019 and onwards, the speculation and vacancy tax rate will vary, depending on residency and where owners pay income tax. Those rates will be two per cent for foreign owners and satellite families and 0.5 per cent for British Columbians and other Canadian citizens or permanent residents who are not members of a satellite family  As of its first quarterly report, the ministry is forecasting revenue of $185 million in 2019-20 and $185 million in 2020-21.; 1
0187.00015; James said there has been an eight per cent drop in the prices of houses, condos and townhouses but did not specify a time period and claimed a lack of background data due to previous Liberal government practices. Her comments came as the government begins consultation with mayors and communities affected by the tax to obtain feedback on the tax to date and to get suggestions for both updates and usages for the revenue. Spec Tax Consultation All by Emma Crawford Hampel, BIV.com on Scribd  Government data said foreign owners (4,612), satellite families (3,060) and Canadians living outside B.C.

0187.00016; Canadian citizens or residents  -  including both B.C. residents and Canadians living outside B.C.  -  accounted for 60 per cent of the homes subject to the tax. Only 238 properties were classified as other, meaning they were held by corporations and trusts.

0188.00001; - Source : -  Last Updated: Sat, Sep 14, 2019 20:29 hrs  New Delhi [India], Sept 14 (ANI): The country's exporters will get the benefit of the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) till December 31, said Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) Alok Vardhan Chaturvedi on Saturday.; 0
0188.00002; The exporters from the country can take the benefits under the MEIS scheme till December 31.; 0
0188.00003; Thereafter, a new scheme which will compensate them more than the existing scheme will come into force, Chaturvedi told ANI here.; 0
0188.00004; The MEIS scheme was implemented by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi government in its first term to offset infrastructural inefficiencies and the associated costs of exporting products produced in India by giving special emphasis on those which are of India's export interest and have the capability to generate employment and enhance India's competitiveness in the world market. Chaturvedi added that an additional insurance cover will be provided to exporters and at the same time increase in insurance coverage from 60 per cent to 90 per cent by the Export Credit Guarantee Corporation (ECGC) will also provide much-needed respite to the bankers.; 0
0188.00005; ECGC used to provide insurance for 60 per cent of the bank credit, but under the new scheme, it will be increased to 90 per cent which will comfort the banks and enable them to give more loans. Currently, there had been a decline in the export credit extended to the exporters, he said. Chaturvedi also denied the reports of any slowdown in exports during the trimester from April to August and added that the new scheme for exporters will have a similar revenue implication as to the current one.; 0
0188.00006; He added that the priority sector norms will be reviewed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) which will lead to additional lending of Rs 30,000 crore to exporters in the coming days.; 1
0188.00007; For the benefit of exporters, banks like SBI will also give them loans in dollars at their branches located in foreign nations.; 0
0188.00008; This will also benefit the RBI and the banks who will be able to provide money to MSMEs and other companies. The Commerce Minister has also hinted the banks to provide loans at lowered interest rates, he said. Adequate Foreign Currency resources will be made available at a reasonable cost to Banks with support of RBI.; 0
0188.00009; This will support the expansion of export credit at lower rates. This intervention along with the enhanced and affordable ECGC cover will ensure that foreign and Rupee export credit interest rates will be below 4% and 8% respectively and increase credit availability.; 0
0188.00010; Apart from all these, exporters also used to face difficulties in getting the refund of the input tax credit as it was a manual process till date but now that the process has been made completely online it will be refunded at the earliest, he added.; 0

0190.00001; 23 Sep  FEE  The media praises Elizabeth Warren as the 2020 candidate with a plan for everything.; 0
0190.00002; Many of her supporters are drawn to her because she is clear about what issues are important to her and what she will do to improve or solve the problems she sees.; 0
0190.00003; Q2 hedge fund letters, conference, scoops etc  pasja1000 / Pixabay  One of the core issues of her campaign is Rebuilding the Middle Class, and her plan to do this is fairly simple: Tax the very richest Americans on their assets and then redistribute the money to the rest of America.; 0
0190.00004; While this might work on paper and appeal to many who are angered by the fact that some people have more money than them, this idea is not new, and when it was tried in the past it failed to achieve its goals. The purpose of the Ultra Millionaire Tax is to curb the growing concentration of wealth in America. According to Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, the two left-leaning University of California-Berkley economists who wrote Warren's policy proposal, the top one percent richest Americans own the same amount of asset wealth that the bottom 95 percent has.; 0
0190.00005; This figure, which is sourced by them, is proof in their eyes that America is in an inequality crisis.; 0
0190.00006; To help stop this crisis, anyone with over $50 million in assets will be taxed annually for two percent of that value, and anyone with over $1 billion in assets will be taxed at three percent.; 1
0190.00007; This will be implemented by expanding the IRS bureaucracy, having these tax collectors appraise the value of the property (her website doesn't address that there could be a conflict of interest), and having a mandatory annual audit rate to make sure everyone pays - and if you dare try to renounce your citizenship because of this tax, then the IRS will seize 40 percent of what you own as an exit tax.; 1
0190.00008; America prides itself on being the land of the free.; 0
0190.00009; While our country hasn't always lived up to that ideal, we have worked closer to it as we have moved forward. The Ultra Millionaires Tax is a step backward from that ideal.; 0
0190.00010; It is a first step in eroding property rights, and the exit tax is a declaration that you are not free - you belong to the state. As it is proposed now, this plan is most likely unconstitutional should the Supreme Court ever need to decide. Likewise, the mandatory audit rates will create an unnecessary burden and expense to honest taxpayers, along with a lot of stress.; 0
0190.00011; But the goal of this proposal is to whip up populist anger against a tiny minority of the country that will translate into votes for Warren.; 0
0190.00012; Statements directly from her website, like The 400 richest Americans currently own more wealth than all Black households and a quarter of Latino households combined, are crafted to appeal to Black and Latino Americans as victims suffering under a tiny elite that has been oppressing them.; 0
0190.00013; One should also look at the policy's primary purpose to understand its key flaw. It's not here to lift people out of poverty, it's here to combat inequality.; 0
0190.00014; Today, the vast majority of American households have electricity, plumbing, TV, food, air conditioning, and cars.; 0
0190.00015; Americans enjoy one of the highest standards of living in the world.; 0
0190.00016; Today's middle class enjoys things that yesterday's ultra-rich could only dream of.; 0
0190.00017; There wouldn't be an equality crisis if people were unaware that others were living in bigger houses than them. A more accurate term should be jealousy crisis. Probably the biggest practical issue of the Ultra Millionaire's Tax would be how an individual's assets will be appraised.; 0
0190.00018; It is very easy for unrealized values to be inflated by a government bureaucrat whose livelihood comes from the number of tax dollars he could rake in.; 0
0190.00019; Likewise, the mandatory audit rates will pressure those doing the audits to find issues that might not really exist in order to justify their job performance.; 0
0190.00020; The economists who wrote this plan estimate that 75,000 households will pay the tax, and that will generate $2.75 trillion over ten years.; 1
0190.00021; Warren proposes that this money can fund programs like universal childcare, student loan debt relief, down payments on the Green New Deal, and Medicare for All. But performing a little research shows that the money from this tax would not fully fund her economy that works for everyone.; 0
0190.00022; The only thing this plan can fund is less than three years of current federal spending when it's combined with every other existing tax.; 0
0190.00023; The general idea that the federal government would be effective at wealth redistribution by taking it from the rich, who don't need all that wealth, and then giving it to the poor already has a shoddy track record. Six of the ten richest counties per capita are in Washington, DC, suburbs.; 0
0190.00024; It appears that most tax dollars that reach the capital never leave it because the government spends it on large staffs with salaries that average $110,000 a year plus generous benefits. Senator Warren's Ultra Millionaire Tax might be a new and radical idea for a major US presidential contender to propose, but other countries have tried wealth taxes before, and the majority of those that did later repealed them.; 0
0190.00025; In 1990, 12 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development had imposed some form of a wealth tax on their citizens.; 0
0190.00026; By 2017, that number declined to only four member countries, a 66 percent decrease. If this was such a great policy idea, then why didn't the trend move in the other direction?In France, where wealth taxes still exist, millionaires have been leaving the country by the tens of thousands.; 0
0190.00027; And along with this exit of citizens is an exit of tax revenues.; 0
0190.00028; Before, these people paid income taxes, but the wealth tax was seen as too much for them.; 0
0190.00029; They left, and now the French government no longer collects any revenue from those people. This is why Warren's plan imposes an exit penalty on anyone who wants to renounce their citizenship.; 0
0190.00030; She understands how people will react to this policy, and she wants to restrict their freedom to make the already difficult choice to leave the country they call home. The left-leaning economists proposing this policy expect to raise $2.75 trillion dollars over 10 years.; 0
0190.00031; Conservative economists believe this plan and other extreme tax-the-rich plans will actually cause the government to take in less money in the future than it would under current tax rates.; 0
0190.00032; Even if this policy did have any positive net effect on tax revenue, the pitch that it could fund a lot of wonderful new spending promises is at best naive and at worst deliberately dishonest.; 0
0190.00033; The federal government cannot even fund its current spending and is $22.5 trillion in debt.; 0
0190.00034; This policy proposal should be a red flag for anyone who believes in personal responsibility, free markets, hard work, and private property. It should be a red flag for anyone who believes in the Constitution, freedom, and the idea that those who don't know history are destined to repeat it.; 0
0190.00035; If Warren becomes the next president, America will most likely see its wealthiest citizens flee the country - along with their capital and moveable assets - before this policy has a chance to go into effect.; 0

0190.00039; Only a tiny percent of Americans would have to pay this tax in its current form, and her supporters believe that these people need to give back after taking so much from American workers. So why should I, a plebian, dare not just go with the program?

0192.00001; Newsletter A A  MUMBAI: Many companies have stopped expansion plans and are reaching out to tax experts after the corporate tax for new companies has been pegged at 15%. The reason being that instead of investing directly, if a separate entity is formed for the same investment, there could be a tax arbitrage of about 10%.; 1
0192.00002; Last Friday, FM Nirmala Sitharaman had announced the lowest corporate tax rate for new manufacturing units that begin production before March 31, 2023. The effective tax rate for such companies could be around 17%, including surcharge.; 0
0192.00003; Tax experts said most companies that have expansion plans, including the ones in pharma and engineering sectors, are evaluating setting up new entities to take advantage of the lower tax structure.; 0
0192.00004; A 10% tax arbitrage is huge for any business, and several companies would be looking at creating new fully owned legal entities from where dividend can be received and dividend distribution tax (DDT) can be set off so there is no leakage of tax.; 0
0192.00005; As far as reconstructing of business is concerned, there is a Supreme Court order that defines what constitutes reconstructing of business and companies will have to create structures that don't flout these norms, said Dinesh Kanabar, CEO of tax consultancy Dhruva Advisors.; 0
0192.00006; Talks on with tax consultants The current regulations say that the new investment cannot be restructuring, but allow fresh capital expenditure through a new legal entity. Companies will have to deal with cash management, dividend distribution tax, increased compliance among other things if they form new companies to get the 15% tax benefit.; 0
0192.00007; Many major companies are weighing this option but the inclination to save tax seems to be overpowering other considerations for now, said industry insiders.; 0
0192.00008; A major pharma company, for instance, that was looking to set up a new unit has just halted its plans.; 0
0192.00009; It is now planning to set up a 100%-owned subsidiary that would be done as a new entity from where the investment will be made.; 0
0192.00010; Industry trackers said some conditions will have to be met so that the taxman doesn't harass companies in the coming years, if this route has to be explored.; 0
0192.00011; While companies can avail 15% tax rate by making capital expenditure through a new legal entity, they have to be mindful that this is not a restructuring and even the new company shouldn't have borrowed money from existing entity or even customers can't be moved to the new company.; 1
0192.00012; Apart from that, several other factors like cash management, DDT and business cycles in the sector and the amount of time to break even will have to be taken into consideration as well, said Girish Vanvari, founder, Transaction Square. Another pharma company  -  that was looking to expand its facility to manufacture a new drug and had almost finalised the project before the announcement came in  -  has now reached out to its tax consultants. It is considering whether the same investment can be carried out through a separate legal entity.; 0
0192.00013; However, if this has to be done, the company needs a robust tax structure and will have to meet all the preconditions set by the government.; 0
0192.00014; Condition on existing employees One of the conditions that companies will have to take care of is that they do not use the same plant and machinery in the new entity.; 0
0192.00015; Not only that, the new entity cannot have more than 20% of existing employees and will have to look out for new customers as well.; 0
0192.00016; Many companies are contemplating that they create new legal entities, but they will have to buy new plant and machinery and find new clients or customers, otherwise it can be categorised as restructuring of business. Also, there is no revenue loss for tax department if investment is done through new entities as that seems to be the objective of the government for this regulation, said Amit Singhania, partner, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas.; 0
0192.00017; Insiders point out that there is a fear that some companies may sell off their existing assets only to be bought by the new entity, but that will come under the taxman's scrutiny. Industry experts said the taxman can even use General Anti Avoidance Rule (GAAR), an anti-avoidance rule, to make sure companies do not evade tax. The 15% or 17% tax rate is the best rate that a company can avail.; 0
0192.00018; Companies going for this route should also be mindful of GAAR as it will have to demonstrate that the new legal entity is not merely a front of the old company, said Kanabar. A person with direct knowledge of the matter said some of the major manufacturing companies, including those in the auto sector, are also exploring this route.; 0
0192.00019; Many auto companies may set up new facilities for their upcoming new products as well. However, this route could first be explored for smaller investments mainly for auto components, the person said.; 0

0193.00005; Before the discovery of crude oil in Nigeria in 1956, the non-oil sector, especially the agricultural sector, was the mainstay of the economy. The agricultural sector alone provided 85 per cent of the country's foreign exchange earnings in the 60s.; 0

0194.00002; By  Murali Ravi  -  IST  Owaisi hits centre Working people or industrialists, who are in real need  With the latest biggest relief of tax exemption for the corporates, not only the positivity but there seems to be opposition adding up. The All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen leader Asaduddin Owaisi has slammed the centre's move which is by Nirmala Sitharaman.; 0
0194.00003; He said whether who was in the real need, whether, the working people or industrialists, in times of economic slow down. Owaisi questioned the Centre saying, In an economic crisis with mass unemployment, who should get relief from burdensome taxes & service fees?. Should it be big business or YOU?; 0
0194.00004; Who's more in need of relief: industrialists or working people? Ever since 28 years, this is the first-ever corporate tax breakage that happened with almost 10 percentage points which could be perceived with a thumping amount of Rs 1.45-lakh-crore tax break. Whereas it seemed to pull the deep stuck economy out of a six-year-low growth and a whopping high unemployment by reviving private investments.; 0
0194.00005; AIMM chief tweeted as Why's @nisitharaman in such a giving mood.; 0
0194.00006; Owaisi expressed his views as rich corporations get their loans written off and taxes were also slashed further.; 0
0194.00007; Whereas debit-ridded farmers and the unemployed youth or students with education loans are asked to pay themselves.; 0

0195.00001; By By Matthew Green Reuters 27 minutes ago  Almost 90 big companies in sectors from food to cement to telecommunications are pledging to slash their greenhouse gas emissions in a new campaign to steer multi-nationals towards a low-carbon future.; 1
0195.00002; We Mean Business, a coalition of advocacy groups, said dozens of companies had joined the initiative in the two months leading up to a United Nations summit taking place on Monday, which aims to spur faster action on climate change.; 0
0195.00003; Now we need many more companies to join the movement, sending a clear signal that markets are shifting, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement on Sunday. The coalition was launched in June with a call to action by the United Nations, business and civil society leaders. The first 28 companies to join announced the following month.; 0
0195.00004; We Mean Business said 87 companies are now involved, with total market capitalisation of more than $US2.3 ($A3.4) trillion.; 1
0195.00005; Some companies in the coalition have agreed to slash their carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, including Swiss food company Nestle, French building materials company Saint-Gobain, and French cosmetics maker L'Oreal .; 0
0195.00006; Others have stopped short of committing to go carbon neutral but say they will align their operations with a goal of limiting the increase in average global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius enshrined in the 2015 Paris Agreement. This group includes Finnish telecoms company Nokia , French food group Danone and British drug maker AstraZeneca Plc, We Mean Business said. As accelerating climate impacts from melting ice caps to sea-level rise and extreme weather outpace climate models, scientists say the world needs to halve its greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade to avoid catastrophic warming.; 0
0195.00007; With fossil fuel companies still developing new oil and gas fields and many developing countries expanding coal-fired power, the coalition's pledges are minuscule relative to rising global emissions.; 0
0195.00008; Some experts have questioned whether publicly traded companies committed to maximizing shareholder returns will be able to make the sweeping investments required to fight climate change.; 0
0195.00009; Yet many investors have been pressuring companies to act on climate risks, and chief executives also face pressure from an upsurge in youth-led activism, which mobilized millions around the world to protest on Friday.; 0
0195.00010; We Mean Business believes pledges by a core of mostly European, and some North American and Asian companies, to commit to independently-verified emissions targets will prompt others to follow suit. These bold companies are leading the way towards a positive tipping point where 1.5degC-aligned corporate strategies are the new normal for businesses and their supply chains around the world, said Lise Kingo, chief executive of the UN Global Compact, which promotes responsible business practices.; 0
0195.00011; U.N. chief Guterres sees the private sector as crucial to securing more ambitious pledges at Monday's Climate Action Summit in New York, which aims to boost the Paris deal before it enters a crucial implementation phase next year.; 0

ANTI-SENSE OLIGONUCLEOTIDE PLATFORM FOR RARE GENETIC DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM Awardee Organization: Abstract Text: Project Summary: Antisense oligonucleotide platform for rare genetic diseases of the nervous system Rare diseases affect nearly one in ten people in the United States. Approximately two million of those individuals suffer from rare diseases of the nervous system such as ALS, Fragile X Syndrome, Rett Syndrome, and severe epileptic encephalopathies.; 0
0197.00006; Orphan disease variants are often not of interest to large pharmaceutical companies.; 0
0197.00007; As a result, hundreds of thousands of patients are left not knowing the cause, potential treatments, or prognosis for their disease creating a large unmet medical need globally. Antisense oligonucleotides or ASOs have several characteristics that make them amenable to a precision medicine approach for treating underlying genetic defects. The FDA has recently approved multiple ASO products for the treatment of rare genetic disease in severe cases unresponsive to traditional drug therapies.; 0
0197.00008; These include nusinersen for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy, eteplirsen for the treatment of Duchene muscular dystrophy and mipomersen for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.; 0
0197.00009; Therapeutic ASOs are generally 15-30 nucleotides in length and complementary to mRNA or pre-spliced mRNA to either inhibit translation through RNAseH mediated mRNA decay or induce exon skipping or inclusion during mRNA splicing. The type of disease-causing variant, whether recessive, dominant gain-of- function or dominant loss-of- function (haploinsufficiency) and intended mode of action of the ASO dictate the design requirement for ASO treatment.; 0
0197.00010; Despite the recent clinical successes, ASO design is not rational and requires hundreds of ASO candidates to be synthesized and then evaluated in cell-based assays to identify top ASO candidates. Many of these ASOs often contain undesirable characteristics reducing the probability of positive outcomes in in vivo models and in safety evaluation. In Phase 1, we propose to construct a variant classification algorithm to determine which variants may be amenable to ASO treatment and construct an algorithm to design an appropriate ASO therapy for the associated rare disease variant.; 0
0197.00011; We will use ASOs designed through these algorithms to test their efficacies in patient derived iPS cell-derived neurons with causative variants for early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy, a devastating neurological disease associated with rare variants in KCNQ2 and KCNT1, often resulting in significant intellectual development impairment and mortality in childhood.; 0
0197.00012; We will expand our ASO platform to new genetic diseases and ASO methodologies in Phase 2 with the goal of developing treatments for patients with rare neurological disorders. Public Health Relevance Statement: Project Narrative: Antisense oligonucleotide platform for rare genetic diseases of the nervous system Although the FDA has recently approved multiple antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) for the treatment of rare genetic diseases, there remain several shortcomings in the existing tools used to design and validate ASO.; 0
0197.00013; We propose to construct a variant classification algorithm to determine which variants may be amenable to ASO treatment and construct an algorithm to design an appropriate ASO therapy for the associated rare disease variant. We will use ASOs designed through these algorithms to test their efficacies in patient derived neurons with causative variants for early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy, a rare devastating neurological disease associated with variants in in the genes KCNQ2 and KCNT1, often resulting in significant intellectual development impairment and mortality in childhood.; 0

0198.00009; Federal prosecutors in New York and Washington spent months probing payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign to two women who said they had affairs with Trump, including Daniels and model Karen McDougal. Cohen, who made one of the payments himself and arranged for American Media Inc., the parent company of the National Enquirer, to pay the other, pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations, tax evasion and other crimes and is serving a three-year sentence.

No one besides Cohen was charged, though prosecutors said in public court filings that Trump himself was aware of and directed the payments.; 0
0198.00012; The Trump Organization also reimbursed Cohen for money he paid to Daniels.; 0

0200.00002; A lot depends on trash plan.; 0
0200.00003; The St. Paul City Council will have the unenviable task on Wednesday of approving a maximum tax levy limit that would add nearly $35 million to property taxes in 2020. The $190.7 million levy would be a 22 percent tax increase over the current year.; 1
0200.00004; The number represents the most that could be collected from property owners next year.; 0
0200.00005; It may be a fraction of that. It depends in large part on the outcome of a public referendum on organized trash collection. The maximum tax levy is just that  -  a maximum.; 0
0200.00006; Between Wednesday and the finalization of the city budget and tax levy in December, the tax levy could be adjusted downward  -  in this case, far downward  -  but it cannot increase above that limit.; 0

0200.00008; WHY A 22 PERCENT HIKE? So why might the city council contemplate increasing property tax collections by 22 percent next year? Much of it has to do with the Nov. 5 ballot, when residents will determine whether to support the new trash collection system that St. Paul rolled out a year ago.; 1
0200.00009; If voters vote it down, the ordinance that created the billing system would be struck from law, but city officials believe they can still keep the overall system intact.; 0
0200.00010; They would do that by moving $27 million in funding from direct fee billing to the general fund, which is heavily supported by citywide property taxes.; 0
0200.00011; After combining the proposed St. Paul, St. Paul Port Authority, Ramsey County and St. Paul School District levies, on top of other special taxing districts, the owner of a median-value St. Paul home  -  $199,800  -  would see their property taxes rise $356, or 12.6 percent.; 1

You'll find out how to calculate what you're owed, how to claim and much more. What is Universal Credit?; 0
0204.00004; Universal Credit is replacing the following benefits:  Child Tax Credit Housing Benefit Income Support Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) Working Tax Credit  It is being phased in across the stages and so you don't need to do anything until you hear from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). You cannot claim if you either:  Get the severe disability premium or are entitled to it Got or were entitled to the severe disability premium in the last month, and you're still eligible for it  How is it paid?; 0
0204.00005; The DWP (Image: Kirsty O'Connor/PA Wire)  Universal Credit is paid monthly - or twice a month for some people in Scotland.; 0

0204.00009; According to the Money Advice Service: Universal Credit is made up of a basic allowance plus different elements for things like housing costs, bringing up children, caring or sickness and disability. The amount you get in Universal Credit can go down or up depending on what income you get from:  working a pension other benefits savings and capital above £6,000. You can get an estimate of how much you will be entitled to here.; 0
0204.00010; You can work as many hours as you like while claiming Universal Credit.; 0
0204.00011; You could be entitled to a work allowance if you're in work - which is the amount of money you can earn before your benefit payment is affected. Your Universal Credit payment will then go down by 63p for every £1 you earn above this amount.; 1
0204.00012; This is called the earnings taper. You have to apply for Universal Credit online.; 0

0207.00001; Share  By now you probably know that you want to retire at some point, and if you're like most Americans you either haven't saved enough for retirement or you're worried that you haven't.; 0
0207.00002; But don't let that worry paralyze you - start saving!; 0
0207.00003; How, you ask? Take it one step at a time with our retirement planning guide. Photo credit: © iStock/Arminius-SST  Let's start with retirement baby steps.; 0
0207.00004; Before we even talk about how you're going to save more money, let's talk about free money and money you've already saved.; 0
0207.00005; That means hunting down languishing qualified retirement plans. Think 401(k) accounts from former jobs, accounts you haven't bothered to consolidate or roll over.; 0
0207.00006; If you think there isn't enough in these old accounts to justify the work of rolling them over into an IRA or the 401(k) at your new job, think again.; 0
0207.00007; Doing this will help you get a better handle on where you stand with retirement savings and will make it easier to monitor your progress. With retirement, every little bit helps, and the sooner you get these accounts working for you the better you'll feel.; 0
0207.00008; If your income falls on the lower end of the spectrum, take advantage of the saver's tax credit the government offers for the first $2,000 you save each year.; 1
0207.00009; It's free money - take it. Many Americans have retirement investment options through their employer.; 0
0207.00010; There are several types of retirement funds available to American employees.; 0
0207.00011; For government employees, these are usually 457 plans. For certain public school employees, employees of tax-exempt organizations and ministers, these are typically 403(b) accounts. The rest of us workers in the private sector can join 401(k) plans if they're offered.; 0
0207.00012; Max out the employer match if your retirement plan comes with one.; 0
0207.00013; Any retirement planning article will tell you the same thing. There are no downsides to this. It's free money, and you've earned it by being such an awesome employee.; 0
0207.00014; If your employer-sponsored 401(k) has higher fees than your IRA, you should fund your 401(k) only up to the employer match, then put any other savings into a lower-fee investment vehicle.; 0
0207.00015; When choosing between retirement investment companies, always look for low fees.; 0
0207.00016; Are you self-employed? That's no excuse to skip out on retirement savings.; 0
0207.00017; The IRS offers what's known as a SEP-IRA.; 0
0207.00018; SEP stands for Simplified Employee Pension, and it's a way that self-employed people and business owners can set up retirement accounts for themselves and their employees.; 0
0207.00019; SEP-IRAs are relatively easy to set up, and have flexible rules on annual contributions, so you can save more in good years and less in lean ones. Photo credit: © iStock/DNY59  So the retirement planning is moving along -you've rolled over old plans, you've funded your 401(k) up to the employer match and you still have some money you'd like to put away for retirement. Or, you want to save but you don't have employer-sponsored options.; 0
0207.00020; Now what? It's time to choose between a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA (choose a SEP-IRA if you're lucky enough to be your own boss). What's the difference between an IRA and a Roth IRA?; 0
0207.00021; With a Roth IRA, the money you invest comes from your after-tax income. That means you won't have to pay taxes when you withdraw from a Roth IRA in your golden years.; 0
0207.00022; With a traditional IRA, your retirement funds come from pre-tax income, which makes it a little less painful to save now but means you'll have to pay taxes when you take the money out down the road. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred investing, but the money you contribute will still be taxed later on, after your money has grown.; 0
0207.00023; The big question to ask when deciding between these two options is this: Is my current tax bracket higher or lower than it will be when I start using this money? If you're a freelancer living with six roommates now, chances are you'll be in a higher tax bracket by the time you hit your 60s or 70s and withdraw from your retirement account.; 0
0207.00024; If that's the case, you're better off going with a Roth IRA.; 0
0207.00025; Plus, if you're income is too high, the IRS won't allow you to contribute to a Roth IRA, since the Roth is a vehicle designed to help people on the lower end of the income spectrum.; 0
0207.00026; Another factor to consider is what your taxes will be like on your other retirement vehicles. Do you have some money from an inheritance sitting in an index fund account that you'll pay taxes on when you start using the money?; 0
0207.00027; Consider a Roth IRA to diversify between taxed and non-taxed accounts. The best retirement investments complement each other.; 0
0207.00028; Don't cash out if you can help it If you withdraw from a 401(k) or traditional IRA before you hit age 59 ½ you'll pay for it in the form of a 10% early withdrawal penalty.; 1
0207.00029; There are currently eight exceptions to the 10% penalty rule, for things like needing the money to pay for medical expenses or for higher education. Unless your situation falls under one of these exceptions, leave the money in your retirement account for as long as you can. Save it and forget it.; 0
0207.00030; It doesn't exist.; 0
0207.00031; It can't pay for your Caribbean cruise.; 0
0207.00032; When it comes to retirement planning, you want to ensure you transition to retirement like a swan landing in a lake, not a plane making a crash landing. The best retirement plans grow with you.; 0
0207.00033; The traditional approach has been glide path investing - also known as a target date fund. You tell the fund the date on which you want to retire, and the fund shifts to more conservative investment vehicles (i.e. from stocks to bonds) the closer you get to that date.; 0
0207.00034; This approach has pros and cons. On the pro side, it automatically lowers your risk over time and aligns with our decreasing appetite for uncertainty and risk in old age.; 0
0207.00035; On other hand, people are living longer and longer, increasing the risk that we'll outlive our savings. In the old days, you could get on a glide path and live off the modest returns from a conservative, bond-focused portfolio in later years because your retirement didn't last very long.; 0
0207.00036; But now, with people living 25+ years in retirement, some analysts argue we need some growth built into our retirement accounts, even after we hit our 60s. Otherwise, we risk both outliving our savings and missing out on stock market gains.; 0
0207.00037; So on the con side, a target date fund can take seniors out of stocks and into bonds too soon. The trade-off with owning stocks (or in investor speak, equity allocation) is between growth and volatility.; 0
0207.00038; If you keep a higher portion of your portfolio in stocks, you have more growth potential, but you also face more risk that your savings will take a nosedive when the market does.; 0
0207.00039; On the other hand, if by the time you hit retirement all your money is in low-yield bonds and CD's, you'd better be darn sure you have enough money to support yourself for the rest of your life - and to keep up with inflation and cost of living increases.; 0
0207.00040; How you start decumulating your retirement assets will depend on the investment vehicle you chose. If you have a traditional IRA, you're required to start drawing it down once you turn 70 ½.; 0
0207.00041; This is known as the Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) rule. If you have a Roth IRA, you can keep contributing to it even after 70 ½, and you're not subject to RMDs.; 0
0207.00042; Planning for retirement involves more than just paperwork and frugality - it also involves some reflection. What are your current expenses and will they increase or decrease in retirement?; 0
0207.00043; Do you want a lavish retirement or a modest one?; 0
0207.00044; Do you want to quit work cold turkey or transition to a part-time job in retirement?; 0
0207.00045; How high is your risk tolerance?; 0
0207.00046; Think about your answers to these questions and discuss them with anyone who shares your financial fate, like a partner or dependent. If you break retirement planning down into manageable steps, you'll be on your way to a comfortable old age.; 0
0207.00047; With some saving and strategizing now, by the time you're retired you can worry about your bingo game and not your investment portfolio. More from SmartAsset; 0

0209.00001; Seeking Alpha  Long Ideas | Services  |  About: Fiserv, Inc. (FISV), Includes: BAC, FDC, FIS, V  by: Labutes IR  Labutes IR  Long/short equity, mutual fund manager, foreign companies, banks  Summary  Fiserv has recently acquired First Data making it one of the largest fintech companies in the U.S.  This acquisition should lead to higher growth prospects than on a stand-alone basis, while synergies can provide further upside if the integration goes well. Fiserv trades at some discount to peers, which doesn't seem to be justified.; 0
0209.00002; Fiserv (FISV) is an interesting fintech company and its recent acquisition of First Data (FDC) gives it higher upside potential if the integration is well executed.; 0
0209.00003; Its valuation can appear high in absolute terms, but compared to its closest peers it trades at a discount. Its share price still seems to have upside, despite the impressive run in recent years.; 0
0209.00004; Fiserv provides integrated information management and electronic commerce systems and services to the financial industry. Its solutions include transaction processing, electronic bill payment and presentment, business process outsourcing, beyond others.; 0
0209.00005; It was founded in 1984 and nowadays serves clients in more than 100 countries. It has a market capitalization of about $71 billion and trades on the NASDAQ. Business & Growth Fiserv's core business is to provide financial companies with the technology services they need to operate, such as core processing systems, electronic billing and payment systems.; 0
0209.00006; It operates in a highly competitive industry.; 0
0209.00007; Its main competitors include Visa (V), MasterCard (MA), PayPal (PYPL), Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) or ACI Worldwide (ACIW).; 0
0209.00008; Fiserv serves customers of all sizes, but its competitive advantage has been with small to midsized banks without in-house processing units.; 0
0209.00009; It serves about 12,000 clients worldwide, but some 95% of its revenue is generated in the U.S. The company's business is spread across different services, but processing and services revenue is the major source given that it represented about 85% of the company's total revenue in the last year. These services are primarily generated from account and transaction based fees under contracts that have terms between 3 and 5 years, generally with high renewal rates.; 0
0209.00010; This means that the vast majority of Fiserv's business has a relatively good visibility regarding revenues in the medium-term, giving it a relatively defensive business profile.; 0
0209.00011; Fiserv has a very good growth history, both organically as more financial transactions are moving online and through acquisitions.; 0
0209.00012; Fiserv has targeted businesses that complements its own, enabling it to provide a wide range of integrated products and services to customers.; 0
0209.00013; Its annual revenues have increased each year since 2010, with 2009 the only year with lower revenues compared to the previous one due to the global financial crisis.; 0
0209.00014; Profitability also has improved over the past decade as the company got larger and more efficient, reflected in its EBITDA margin that increased from levels of about 32% in 2009 to a new record high of near 38% in 2018.; 1
0209.00015; Going forward, Fiserv is expected to pursue growth opportunities both from developing existing services and potential acquisitions that are complementary to its business profile.; 0
0209.00016; Additionally, new-client wins and sales of additional services to existing processing clients should support organic revenue growth, as customers of banks are increasingly adopting peer-to-peer payments and digital banking, which is good for fintech companies like Fiserv.; 0
0209.00017; Regarding its financial performance, Fiserv has an impressive track record delivering top and bottom-line growth and generating significant cash flow over the past few years.; 0
0209.00018; In 2018, Fiserv's revenues amounted to $5.8 billion, an increase of 2.2% from the previous year.; 0
0209.00019; Its operating income was $1.8 billion, while net income decreased a little to $1.2 billion due to disposals.; 1
0209.00020; The company's cash flow generation remained strong with net cash from operating activities of $1.6 billion and free cash flow of $1.3 billion.; 0
0209.00021; This means that Fiserv's free cash flow generation is very good, given that it has been above 100% in the past two years due to its tech-oriented business with low need of fixed assets.; 1
0209.00022; Source: Fiserv.; 0
0209.00023; During the first six months of 2019, Fiserv maintained a very good operating performance with adjusted revenue up by 6% year-on-year to around $2.9 billion and adjusted EPS up by 11% yoy, to $1.66 per share.; 0
0209.00024; On the other hand, its adjusted operating margin declined by some 40 basis points (bps) and Fiserv's free cash flow conversion was below 100%, due to a decline in profitability at its Payments unit during the first quarter of 2019.; 1
0209.00025; For the rest of the year, Fiserv's target is to reach 4.5-5% organic revenue growth in 2019 and adjusted EPS growth of 10-14%.; 0
0209.00026; Operating margins are expected to increase by more than 50 bps, while free cash flow conversion should remain above 100% for the full year. Investors should note that these targets do not include any impact of its recent acquisition of First Data.; 0
0209.00027; Regarding the shareholder remuneration policy, as a growth company, Fiserv doesn't distribute dividends to shareholders preferring instead to perform share buybacks as a capital return policy.; 0
0209.00028; In 2018, Fiserv purchased $1.91 billion of its common stock, which represented about 6% of its average market capitalization during the year. Due to the acquisition of First Data, Fiserv's share buyback program is on hold and the company is not expected to resume share repurchases until it deleverages its balance sheet, which may take two years to accomplish.; 0
0209.00029; Fiserv agreed back in January to buy First Data, an electronic payments processor, for about $22 billion in an all-stock transaction. This is one of the largest mergers in the financial industry in the past few months, creating one of the leading companies in the payments industry. The merger was recently closed and Fiserv shareholders own about 57.5% of the new combined company, while First Data shareholders owning 42.5%.; 1
0209.00030; Even though Fiserv has made several acquisitions throughout its history with a good track record, this deal is its largest and most complex so far.; 0
0209.00031; This means that integration risk is high and will change Fiserv's business, with a significant exposure to the intensely competitive market of merchant-payments processing at about 38% of combined revenue.; 1
0209.00032; Source: Fiserv.; 0
0209.00033; Fiserv believes that this business combination makes sense from the complementary assets between the two companies, projecting higher revenue growth than it would achieve on its own and costs savings of about $900 million over five years.; 1
0209.00034; Indeed, the focus of Fiserv will be in the accelerating the combined merchant business, an area where Fiserv was not very strong compared to some peers.; 0
0209.00035; There may exist significant revenue to capture by distributing First Data's merchant-payment services through the thousands of smaller banks that use Fiserv services currently.; 0
0209.00036; It also expected to maintain First Data's partnership with Bank of America (BAC), an important client in the past for First Data, but Fiserv and BAC recently announced that they will pursue independent merchant service strategies in June 2020, when the joint-venture contract expires. This is a negative development for the combined company, but the merger rationale remains valid in my opinion.; 0
0209.00037; Additionally, Fiserv will continue to serve customers of this joint-venture to its proportionate ownership stake (First Data had 51% of the joint-venture) at current pricing for 3 years.; 0
0209.00038; This means that only after that existing contracts may be renewed at lower rates, which should have some negative impact on organic revenue growth thereafter. Nevertheless, Fiserv expects the termination of this joint-venture to be rather neutral to its earnings and free cash flow in the medium-term, an expectation that was well received by the market.; 0
0209.00039; Moreover, even including this setback for Fiserv, it still expects at least 20% adjusted EPS accretion in the first year and more than 40% when First Data is fully integrated, showing the strong business and financial merits of this merger.; 1
0209.00040; Leverage & Valuation Regarding the capital structure, the First Data deal led to higher balance sheet leverage, but Fiserv intends to deleverage to levels more in-line with its previous capital structure within 24 months.; 0
0209.00041; Given that annual free cash flow is expected to be about $3.6 billion, this seems a reasonable target for a relatively short period of time. Source: Fiserv.; 0
0209.00042; Taking this into account, Fiserv is not expected to pursue large acquisitions in the next few years, at least until it achieves the targeted synergies and leverage metrics, while it may make smaller acquisitions that complement its business, in-line with its long-term strategy. Regarding Fiserv's financial numbers going forward, according to analysts' estimates, its revenues should be about $16.2 billion in 2020 (the first full year including First Data), EBITDA is expected to be close to $6 billion or an EBITDA margin of 37%, while net profit should come close to $2.7 billion and EPS is estimated at $3.67.; 0
0209.00043; Taking these numbers into account, Fiserv is currently trading at close to 29x forward earnings and 15.3x EV/EBITDA.; 0
0209.00044; At first glance, these multiples may appear expensive, but compared to its closest peers, Fiserv's valuation seems reasonable and may have some upside given that competitors currently trade above 30x earnings and EV/EBITDA close to 20x.; 0
0209.00045; This means that if Fiserv executes well the integration of First Data and reaches its synergies targets, its current valuation is more than justified and has some upside potential if the market continues to pay high multiples to growth companies like Fiserv. However, if the global economy continues to slow down and equity markets correct, valuations for fintech companies should probably suffer and Fiserv may be more affected than peers, given that its business growth is weaker than some other players in the fintech space, like Visa or PayPal. Fiserv has an interesting position within the fintech industry and its recent acquisition of First Data makes its business more balanced and with stronger growth prospects in the long-term.; 0
0209.00046; Despite these strong fundamentals, Fiserv trades at a discount to its closest peers which doesn't seem to be justified.; 0
0209.00047; Therefore, a re-rating is likely in the medium-term, making Fiserv an interesting growth play right now based on valuation and further upside if the integration of First Data leads to higher synergies than expected.; 0

0212.00001; WHAT CAN I DO TO PROTECT MY COMPANY FROM IDENTITY THEFT? Great question! This issue recently came up when a motor carrier was contacted by a third-party administrator (TPA) who was requesting unlimited access to the motor carrier's intranet so it could file, process, and handle claims.; 0
0212.00002; Specifically, the TPA requested the motor carrier's website login and password information to obtain information and documentation for a claim. This raised a red flag with the motor carrier, rightfully so. Before granting access to sensitive company data or agreeing to do business with anyone, you need to take steps to protect your identity from cyber criminals and other thieves to ensure the brokers, carriers, shippers, and receivers you do business with are legitimate.; 0
0212.00003; There are many ways criminals can steal a person's or company's identity. Below are common theft methods and ideas to help defend your company from identity theft.; 0
0212.00004; A skimmer is a device placed on a card reader commonly found at gas stations and grocery stores that stores a person's credit/debit card information.; 0
0212.00005; A fraudster then uses the stolen card information to make counterfeit cards. Defense: Train drivers to watch for these devices at truck stops.; 0
0212.00006; Identity thieves have no shame and will resort to rummaging through your trash to steal sensitive personal and company data. Defense: Use a mobile shredding service for on-site destruction of documents, hard drives, etc.  Phishing is when a thief poses as a legitimate person and sends emails that have malicious links or attachments included. Once opened, the virus can infect computer systems, stealing login credentials or account information.; 0
0212.00007; Defense: Train employees not to open suspicious emails.; 0
0212.00008; Never email or share passwords, logins, or other sensitive information with third parties. Loose lips sink ships is a communication security slogan dating back to World War II that is still used today.; 0
0212.00009; When employees share sensitive company information with strangers, such as a driver discussing a load of high-value cargo at a truck stop or an office employee walking away from his or her computer without logging out, the company is exposed to theft. Defense: Train employees on communication security techniques.; 0
0212.00010; Impersonators pretend to represent a legitimate broker or carrier to secure a load, and then they create a false bill of lading, pick up the load, and are never heard from again.; 0
0212.00011; A scammer may also pose as a legitimate broker, re-broker a load, then run off with the funds, leaving the second broker and motor carrier empty-handed.; 0

0214.00001; Home > World News > News Wire  Small Shareholders Fight to Salvage Carige's Rescue Plan Please enter your email  Reuters  By Andrea Mandala  >> Election results are in. Subscribe now - save 30%  MILAN, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Thousands of small shareholders in Carige have signed up to attend a meeting on Friday in an attempt to push through a last-ditch rescue plan that could be sunk by the Italian bank's mercurial top investor.; 0
0214.00002; With a 27.5% stake that makes it the single largest investor in Carige, the billionaire Malacalza family has the power to again derail rescue efforts, after blocking a 400 million euro ($442 million) cash call in December and prompting the European Central Bank to place the bank under special administration. Capital needs have since swollen to 900 million euros and Carige faces liquidation or a resolution process should it fail to plug the gap with funds grudgingly provided by healthier peers.; 1
0214.00003; The Malacalzas have not made clear whether or not they back measures that would drastically reduce a stake they have spent more than 400 million euros on and which is now worth 23 million euros. Their absence on Friday would ensure the plan's approval.; 0
0214.00004; Malacalza Investimenti declined to comment. A source close to the matter said expected attendance stood so far at around 80% of Carige's capital.; 0
0214.00005; An attendance rate of at least 90% and a majority of two thirds of votes are needed to counter a potential rejection by the Malacalzas. Please enter a valid email address  Thank you for signing up.; 0

0214.00009; Shareholders must close ranks and bite the bullet, said Davide Viziano, a small builder who has invested in Carige in the past and is now working with other businessmen to boost attendance on Friday.; 0
0214.00010; Carige is a great asset for our economy and it would be awful for us to lose it, he added.; 0
0214.00011; The Liguria region's maritime economy has been battered by the global shipping slump, a domestic recession and last year's deadly collapse of a bridge which severed the port of Genoa's main link to France.; 0
0214.00012; Viziano said the local community had sent smoke signals to the Malacalzas in the hope they either desert the meeting altogether or leave the room during the vote. I understand they may not want to vote in favour, but this what they could do to show they care about Genoa like they did in the past when they stepped in to save Carige. Carige, which had a market value of 85 million euros when its shares were suspended from trading in January, has tapped shareholders for more than 2 billion euros in the last five years.; 0
0214.00013; Weakened by decades of mismanagement and an excessive local exposure, Carige has piled up more than 1.6 billion euros in losses since 2014, mostly due to bad loans.; 1
0214.00014; Under the rescue package, a new share issue would hand control of Carige to a fund financed by Italian lenders before rival Cassa Centrale Banca can exercise an option to take over the bank.; 0

0216.00001; iStockphoto  Roth IRA or traditional IRA? By  Social-media editor  This millennial claims he was FIRE before FIRE became popular. FIRE refers to the financial independence, retire early movement bubbling up in the younger generation these days as a pathway out of the grind  -  slash expenses, save a bundle and enjoy the freedom that approach ultimately allows.; 0

0216.00003; My salary ($55K-$75K) has never been particularly high, so FIRE was always an attractive long-term solution for me, he wrote. Considering that I've only made roughly $450K post-tax from work over the past 10 years, I'm pretty happy with how much I've saved up.; 0

0216.00005; Well, for starters, he lived at home half of that time, a choice many millennials are making as housing costs skyrocket. Living rent-free allowed him to put big chunks of money away  -  up to a whopping 80% of his take-home, he said.; 1

0217.00002; Photograph: Myung Jung Kim/PA  More than 1,400 UK restaurants collapsed in the year since June 2018  -  underlining the scale of the so-called casual dining crunch, which has led to customers turning their backs on chains such as Byron, Strada, Gourmet Burger Kitchen and Jamie Oliver's restaurant empire.; 1
0217.00003; The number of restaurants falling into insolvency in the year to the end of June 2019 increased by 25% to 1,412 compared to 2018, according to research by the accountancy firm UHY Hacker Young.; 0
0217.00004; It is the highest number of insolvencies since at least 2014 and is said to reflect tightened consumer spending on the back of concerns about Brexit and rising costs because of the collapse in the value of the pound.; 0
0217.00005; UHY Hacker Young said the rapid growth of the causal-dining sector since the 2008 financial crisis had resulted in an oversaturated mid-market, which is still going through a dramatic shakeout. The research found that hundreds of small independent restaurants had collapsed as well as big chains such as those owned by the celebrity chef Oliver. More than 1,400 UK restaurants collapsed in 2018-19  The crisis in the restaurant sector has been presented as a problem only for the chains that had lost touch with their customers, Peter Kubik, a partner at UHY Hacker Young, said.; 1

The Fed, however, is unlikely to tip its hand on future interest rate cuts.; 0

0221.00003; Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty Images The Fed is expected to cut interest rates for the second time in a decade Wednesday, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is unlikely to deliver the message markets want to hear on plans for future rate cuts. He'll underwhelm everyone and not overwhelm anyone, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.; 0
0221.00004; She expects a cut of 25 basis point, taking the fed funds target rate range to 1.75 to 2.0%, following the last quarter point cut on July 31.; 1
0221.00005; At the Fed's last meeting, Powell rocked markets, sending stocks lower and bond yields higher when he described the rate cut as a mid-cycle adjustment, meaning it was not part of a larger rate cutting cycle.; 0

VIDEO5:1505:15 CNBC Fed Survey: 100% expect a quarter point cut in September The Fed's approach may make some market pros unhappy, and it will certainly disappoint President Donald Trump who said the Fed were boneheads and called for zero or even negative rates.; 0
0221.00009; Economists said it's unlikely the Fed forecast will include more than one more rate cut in its outlook for this year, presented on a chart, known as the dot plot.; 0
0221.00010; Many in the markets are looking for two more cuts this year.; 0
0221.00011; Besides unsettling some market pros, the Fed is also expected to face opposition from within, with at least two Fed presidents again dissenting to a rate cut. At the last meeting, Kansas City Fed President Esther George and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, objected to the first cut on the grounds it was unwarranted given the strength of the economy.; 0
0221.00012; Their concerns underscore a big dilemma for the Fed, and that is that the economic data in the U.S. has been stronger than expected, while the Fed is making rate cuts as insurance against slowing that could come from elsewhere in the world or other shocks, such as trade wars or Brexit. The economic data couldn't be less supportive of a rate cut. We have core CPI inflation at the highest level since the recession ended.; 0
0221.00013; We have retail sales going straight up, said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG.; 0
0221.00014; We have industrial production off the bottom  -  the much beleaguered manufacturing sectors was one of the key reasons for a Fed rate cut.; 0
0221.00015; August industrial production rose 0.6% last month after an unrevised 0.4% drop in July.; 0
0221.00016; I don't think the Fed's forecast will be green lighting a third rate cut, said Rupkey, noting he thinks the Fed will do one more after the September cut.. BlackRock's Rick Rieder said he expects the Fed will probably cut by 25 basis points but it should do more. I think they'll describe this as a mid-cycle adjustment.; 0
0221.00017; I think they should go 50 [basis points] and then step back, get to the equilibrium point, said Rieder, BlackRock's global CIO of fixed income. If the economy slows, then they can come back.; 0

0221.00021; Powell speaks to reporters following the Fed's release of its statement and new projections on the economy, inflation and interest rates. He may be asked to address something else that ruffled markets this week.; 0
0221.00022; There was a spike in the repo rate, or the interest at which financial institutions fund themselves.; 0
0221.00023; Strategists described the event, which sent the overnight Treasury general collateral rate to 9% Tuesday, as the result of a perfect storm that created a period of illiquidity in markets.; 1
0221.00024; It was described as a cash crunch, but not a credit crisis as in 2008.; 0
0221.00025; Strategists said there was heavy Treasury issuance, which drains liquidity, at the same time corporations were seeking cash for tax payments on Monday. The Fed, in response conducted a repurchase operation Tuesday involving $53 billion worth of various debt instruments as it sought to control the level of its benchmark interest rate. The Fed said it would conduct a second repo transaction Wednesday to inject up to $75 billion in cash into money markets.; 1
0221.00026; The repurchase operation Tuesday was the first since the financial crisis, but there have been warnings of tight liquidity, particularly in December of last year when repo rates rose during the stock market sell off. It came down, but it's still high and it's going to to continue to be high. It's one thing at quarter end and year end when you see these spikes, but you don't expect it in the middle of September, Rieder said.; 0
0221.00027; The Fed needs to let their balance sheet grow. Keep the dollar from appreciating, Rieder said, adding the expansion of the balance sheet would help the situation.; 0
0221.00028; Rieder said the Fed could change the mix of securities it purchases, and focus more on the short end of the Treasury curve.; 0
0221.00029; It could carry out some type of quantitative easing program, as it did before, to enlarge the balance sheet.; 0
0221.00030; The financial system is a much, much bigger part of asset light, capital light economy, he said.; 0
0221.00031; To the extent you have disturbances in that system, you create a better chance of a recession.; 0
0221.00032; Rieder said, even if unfounded, it could also create concerns about stability of the system.; 0
0221.00033; As of yesterday, the Fed had lost control of the funding market, said Mark Cabana, head of short rate strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He said one solution may be for the Fed to form a standing repo operation.; 0
0221.00034; There's been a lot of speculation about the Fed doing a standing repo facility. This probably makes it a little more real...It means the Fed would be available in some shape or form.; 0
0221.00035; Essentially, it's a safety valve for repo, said Michael Schumacher, director rates at Wells Fargo.; 0

0223.00001; Jeremy O. Harris speaks during a talkback of the Black Out performance of Slave Play on Broadway last week. (Photo courtesy of Slave Play on Broadway)  Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion | News Diep Tran Leave a comment  How 'Slave Play' Got 800 Black People to the Theatre It's not just about filling seats but about increasing access and generating an authentic conversation.; 0
0223.00002; By Diep Tran  On Sept. 18, Slave Play set aside all 804 of the seats at Broadway's Golden Theatre for Black theatregoers, and Black theatregoers only. The community responded by showing up and filling those seats for Jeremy O. Harris's provocative drama, among them Jesse Williams, Joy Bryant, Keke Palmer, Kelsey Lu, Tonya Pinkins, Paloma Elsesser, and Norm Lewis. To have the majority of a Broadway audience consist of people of color is undoubtedly a rarity (according to the Broadway League, 75 percent of Broadway ticket buyers are white).; 0
0223.00003; But to have a house that is only Black is almost certainly unprecedented.; 0
0223.00004; Answering questions via Twitter message, Harris said he was challenged to hold the event (dubbed the Black Out) by musician Kelela, who was also in attendance Sept. 18. Asked what the performance was like, Harris says it was like being transported to some new place in the future where this was a standard, not a possibility. It felt like we turned the 'hallowed' space of a theatre into just a building - a building with new possibilities and rules. People got out of their seats to go to the bathroom when they needed, people spoke, people laughed loudly, talked back, people (mon dieu!) texted with their ringers off and screens turned low.; 0
0223.00005; And the whole room felt free. It was like a concert more so than a play and like people in the room were discovering a new amazing band.; 0
0223.00006; Slave Play came to Broadway with strong advance buzz and reviews from its premiere late last year at Off-Broadway's New York Theatre Workshop.; 0
0223.00007; It doesn't hurt that Harris has more than 37,000 followers on Instagram.; 0
0223.00008; But that doesn't mean getting Black audiences to the theatre was easy.; 0
0223.00009; For one, the producers couldn't simply market this special night widely via press agents or build advance buzz for it.; 0
0223.00010; According to Harris, it all came through direct outreach the event wasn't even made public until two days before.; 0
0223.00011; We gave away hundreds of tickets to Black student organizations for free, he says.; 0
0223.00012; Then we invited a bunch of people in the Black community to send the invite around. He adds, I jokingly said it was like the Underground Railroad. The reason the event was kept on the down-low was because, according to Harris, We didn't want to open it up for too many non-Black folks who were possibly angry or upset about it and would try to buy tickets to thwart.; 0
0223.00013; Black Out was part of an atypical audience engagement effort that Harris and the producers have launched around Slave Play.; 0
0223.00014; It includes building a Black community and support network around a work that stirred some heated online controversy for its depictions of interracial relationships and depictions of ostensibly enslaved Black people.; 0
0223.00015; Producers have priced 10,000 tickets to Slave Play at $39. Attendees pose during Black Out.; 0
0223.00016; (Photo courtesy of Slave Play on Broadway)  According to Harris, these initiatives are not a craven ploy for profits: The play is doing quite well, and is playing at almost 99 percent capacity, with more than $1 million in ticket sales and $100,000 in advance sales a day coming in.; 0
0223.00017; I said to my fellow producers when we began this journey, if we are doing Slave Play for a profit we are doing it wrong, says Harris. That's not the politics for me and that's not the politics to the play, and everyone heard it.; 0
0223.00018; Indeed, one of the producing entities, Level Forward (headed by Abigail Disney and Adrienne Becker), insisted that 10 percent of the profits from Slave Play be donated to a nonprofit.; 0
0223.00019; Harris chose the National Black Theatre in Harlem, which focuses on new plays by Black writers, and the U.K.-based Black Ticket Project, which gives Black youths free tickets to theatre performances. Level Forward was founded last year as an entertainment company. Since its inception, it has helped produce on Broadway What the Constitution Means to Me, Oklahoma!, and the upcoming Jagged Little Pill.; 0
0223.00020; Profit sharing is part of Level Forward's business model. Capitalism is critically important and it's a huge responsibility, but it has to be handled thoughtfully, says Becker. The 10 percent is a counterweight on the privilege lottery - the privilege lottery says that only certain people have the best shot of having their voices heard and being seen.; 0
0223.00021; Particularly in a place where there is not a lot of space like Broadway.; 0
0223.00022; With money from previous Broadway shows, Level Forward has donated to Generation Citizen and Shine MSD for Oklahoma! the producers also made sure the production was gun neutral. This producing model allows theatre, which is inherently hyperlocal, to have an impact beyond its performance.; 0
0223.00023; And it diverges from traditional commercial producing in which the profit margin is king.; 0
0223.00024; The producers of Slave Play are trying to balance earnings and access, and modeling a world in which profits don't have to come at the expense of altruism.; 0
0223.00025; In an age where many are debating the ethics of consumption and capitalism, it's natural that the conversation would reach Broadway.; 0
0223.00026; Level Forward is a public benefit corporation, says Becker. We are mandated to balance shareholder return and the greater good.; 0
0223.00027; It's totally doable.; 0
0223.00028; It requires a reprioritization, not purpose over profit, but of balancing. Becker thinks this model can be replicated for a particularly successful show, 10 percent can represent a drop in the income bucket (and these days, even if a show wasn't successful on Broadway, the national tour will usually yield returns).; 0
0223.00029; I think this is one manifestation of a bigger-picture opportunity.; 0
0223.00030; This is an open call to all producers across media to think about how they can redefine what those measures of success are in their business, what is high performance, redefine that. Here's the chance let's kick the door open a little bit more. Following the success of last week's full-house Black Out, the producers of Slave Play are keen to host another similar event.; 0
0223.00031; The production is also hosting a weekly salon every Sunday morning on the Lower East Side to help audience members, in Becker's words, process the play. Harris has also launched a website called Black Work Broadway, a still-in-progress database of Black works that have premiered on Broadway and their production information.; 0
0223.00032; Since launching the list, Harris had made several discoveries.; 0
0223.00033; One is that since 1991, the only Black authors whose work has been revived on Broadway were Lorraine Hansberry and August Wilson. Another: From 1969 to 1979, there were more Black plays on Broadway than any other recent decade, and most were developed in [Black] affinity theatres.; 0
0223.00034; That's another reason Harris is so keen to share some of his profits with the National Black Theatre, which develops new Black plays. Many artists of color get their start at affinity theatres (also known as culturally specific theatres), yet those same institutions are underfunded and smaller compared to their white counterparts.; 0
0223.00035; Slave Play may be his Broadway debut, but he and the producers have been thinking about the impact the work can have, not just on ticket sales. For me it was about Black work begetting Black work and Black audiences, he says.; 0
0223.00036; Indeed, altruism aside, these Slave Play initiatives are ingenious marketing.; 0
0223.00037; Slave Play angered many in the Black community last winter when photos from the show were released and reviews came out, and many thought offered a romanticized portrayal of slavery.; 0
0223.00038; By making sure more people see it, especially more Black people, Harris and the producers can at least ensure that whatever conversation ensues, it's based on firsthand accounts rather than assumptions and hearsay.; 0
0223.00039; From lowering ticket prices to making sure the performance experience is comfortable to newcomers, the team behind Slave Play is approaching accessibility from multiple fronts.; 0
0223.00040; Becker says these new ideas are a byproduct of allowing more diversity in the room, noting that Level Forward is a woman-led company dedicated to supporting artists doing work considered by traditional producers as risky. Female producers are still rare on Broadway.; 0
0223.00041; No one invited all these people in the creative margins into the greenlighting conversation and development conversation, Becker says.; 0
0223.00042; But when you let more voices in, chances are they'll naturally be more innovative. There's just going to be more free thinking.; 0

0229.00019; Initially, the limbo of his playing career appeared to benefit both the apparel giant and Kaepernick.; 0
0229.00020; For Nike, the relationship resulted in tens of millions of dollars of free advertising and heightened credibility with the young, diverse consumers who look up to the player.; 0
0229.00021; For Kaepernick, the contract was lucrative and the might of one of the world's most powerful companies helped his goal of raising awareness of police brutality and systemic racial inequality.; 0

0229.00026; According to measurement firm iSpot.tv, Nike spent $5.2 million to air Dream Crazy on television, representing 5.5 percent of the company's TV spend in the past two years, and the ad was one of the company's best-performing over that time frame.; 1

0229.00035; Instead, over the past year the most notable collaboration between Nike and Kaepernick was his reaction to the creation of another shoe. Nike intended to celebrate the Fourth of July with a release of a limited edition Air Max 1 Quick Strike shoe, with a heel featuring a 13-star American flag, a design associated with the Revolutionary War and Betsy Ross, the Philadelphia seamstress often credited with creating the first American flag (though most scholars dispute this). But that flag has also been used in association with racist ideologies, like when the Ku Klux Klan used it and the Confederate flag on recruitment materials in upstate New York.; 0
0229.00036; In part because Kaepernick privately criticized the design to the company, Nike ultimately canceled the release of the shoe.; 0

0230.00001; Business  Insurers overcharged Texans $92 million last year, rebates are coming Jenny Deam  Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Reddit Pinterest  Comments  Health insurers must issue refunds to hundreds of thousands of Texas consumers overcharged nearly $92 million for plans purchased last year.; 0
0230.00002; The mandate to issue refunds comes under a provision in the Affordable Care Act that limits how much companies can keep for overhead and profit. The bulk of the rebates  -  a total of $80.4 million from four companies -  will go to those who overpaid for plans purchased on the individual market in 2018, according to data from the federal Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Service analyzed by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The rest, roughly $11.5 million, will be refunded by two insurers to more than 500 large Texas employers who bought plans for their workers last year, the data showed.; 1
0230.00003; The refunds will come either as a check to customers or premium credit and must be issued by the end of this month under federal law.; 0
0230.00004; Insurance companies are required to notify customers of the amount and method of disbursement.; 0

0230.00006; Nationally, health insurers must repay a record $743 million to more than 2 million over-charged customers on the individual market  -  more than four times what was paid out in rebates last year, the Kaiser study found. While rebates have been issued most years, the 2018 total is noteworthy as it is the largest and points to a significant over-correction from past rate hikes, health economists say. With the benefit of 20-20-hindsight, last year's premiums were indeed overpriced, said Cynthia Cox, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation.; 1

0231.00002; Here are some teacher insights By Carly Sawatzki  For generations, schools, teachers and parents around Australia have relied on the finance industry for money-related expertise and education for our children.; 0
0231.00003; We now know that our trust was misguided.; 0
0231.00004; Australian school children may well leave school with a preferred bank but many are unprepared for the complex financial problems and decisions they will face as young adults.; 0
0231.00005; I led a research team that looked into the teaching of consumer, economic and financial literacy in government, Catholic and independent secondary schools in Victoria. Our findings could be useful to policy makers, schools, teachers and other interested stakeholders dealing with this issue. Misguided trust  In Australia we regularly invite representatives of banks and financial institutions into our schools to teach our children about managing their finances.; 0
0231.00006; Many schools have been using the school banking programs they offer. However these banks and other financial institutions have been using this access to students to employ subversive sales tactics, blatantly market brand awareness and coach brand loyalty.; 0
0231.00007; Left without essential knowledge  We also know around one in five Australian fifteen year-olds are left without the essential knowledge and skills to confront relatively simple real world financial tasks such as reading pay slips and invoices and detecting scams. In PISA testing of the financial literacy of fifteen year olds, Australia's performance declined significantly between 2012 and 2015. Unknown professional learning needs and impact  Since the global financial crisis, the Australian government and the finance industry have invested significantly in initiatives intended to help young people understand finance.; 0
0231.00008; However there remains limited independent, peer-reviewed research exploring how Australian schools and teachers make sense of and approach their work as consumer, economic and financial literacy educators.; 0
0231.00009; This means that the impact of these various initiatives on school programs, teacher practice and student learning is largely unknown. By extension, so too are teachers' professional learning needs and interests in this field. The Monash University and the Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) research study that I led explored secondary commerce teachers' opportunities and readiness to teach consumer, economic and financial literacy.; 0
0231.00010; The teacher survey we conducted as part of that study revealed some startling statistics.; 0
0231.00011; Less than one-third of those surveyed reported that their school offers compulsory subjects or units that are dedicated to teaching and learning about consumer, economic and financial literacy. The top five topics taught about finance to Year 7 to 10 students are actually found in the Mathematics curriculum. These include calculating the cheapest price per unit of measurement reading and interpreting financial information presented in tables, charts and graphs calculating simple interest calculating compound interest, and making sense of a payslip, including calculating tax and superannuation payments.; 0
0231.00012; In mathematics, algebra prepares students to understand and manage loan, superannuation and investment products.; 0
0231.00013; Here, students learn that when one variable changes (i.e., interest rates rise), there is an inevitable impact on one's financial position (i.e., loan repayments become higher, but so too do returns on savings). While just over half of those surveyed (54%) reported teaching students to take action in response to a too-good-to-be-true or suspicious offer that might be a scam, the number that reported teaching students to identify an email scam was much lower (31%).; 0
0231.00014; Related to the above, only one in five of those surveyed (18%) reported teaching students how to decide whether to provide bank and/or credit card details when paying for products and services online (including apps).; 0

0231.00043; Many schools have been using the school banking programs they offer.; 0
0231.00044; However these banks and other financial institutions have been using this access to students to employ subversive sales tactics, blatantly market brand awareness and coach brand loyalty.; 0
0231.00045; Left without essential knowledge  We also know around one in five Australian fifteen year-olds are left without the essential knowledge and skills to confront relatively simple real world financial tasks such as reading pay slips and invoices and detecting scams.; 0

0231.00047; Unknown professional learning needs and impact  Since the global financial crisis, the Australian government and the finance industry have invested significantly in initiatives intended to help young people understand finance. However there remains limited independent, peer-reviewed research exploring how Australian schools and teachers make sense of and approach their work as consumer, economic and financial literacy educators.; 0
0231.00048; This means that the impact of these various initiatives on school programs, teacher practice and student learning is largely unknown. By extension, so too are teachers' professional learning needs and interests in this field. The Monash University and the Victorian Commercial Teachers Association (VCTA) research study that I led explored secondary commerce teachers' opportunities and readiness to teach consumer, economic and financial literacy.; 0
0231.00049; The teacher survey we conducted as part of that study revealed some startling statistics. Less than one-third of those surveyed reported that their school offers compulsory subjects or units that are dedicated to teaching and learning about consumer, economic and financial literacy.; 0
0231.00050; The top five topics taught about finance to Year 7 to 10 students are actually found in the Mathematics curriculum. These include calculating the cheapest price per unit of measurement reading and interpreting financial information presented in tables, charts and graphs calculating simple interest calculating compound interest, and making sense of a payslip, including calculating tax and superannuation payments.; 0
0231.00051; In mathematics, algebra prepares students to understand and manage loan, superannuation and investment products. Here, students learn that when one variable changes (i.e., interest rates rise), there is an inevitable impact on one's financial position (i.e., loan repayments become higher, but so too do returns on savings).; 0
0231.00052; While just over half of those surveyed (54%) reported teaching students to take action in response to a too-good-to-be-true or suspicious offer that might be a scam, the number that reported teaching students to identify an email scam was much lower (31%). Related to the above, only one in five of those surveyed (18%) reported teaching students how to decide whether to provide bank and/or credit card details when paying for products and services online (including apps).; 0

0232.00001; September 20, 2019 02:20 PM  UAW-GM strike's toll on wages, taxes mounts Dustin Walsh  More  Print  Forgone income taxes already total $2.23 million Lost wages expected to grow next week due to more supplier layoffs Negotiations will continue through the weekend  Bloomberg  General Motors and the UAW have made progress on labor contract negotiations, but some issues remain unresolved, UAW officials told members Thursday.; 0
0232.00002; The economic impact of the now five-day long UAW strike of General Motors Co. is mounting  -  and expected to rise as the strike ripples through the supply base. Striking GM union members, laid-off temporary workers and suppliers workers linked to GM production are losing an estimated $9.3 million per day, according to an analysis released by East Lansing-based Anderson Economic Group.; 1
0232.00003; Due to the forgone wages, the state of Michigan is losing roughly $446,000 per day in income tax revenue, the group said.; 1
0232.00004; This translates to roughly $2.23 million in lost income tax revenue for the state from $46.5 million in lost wages since the strike began at midnight on Monday.; 1
0232.00005; The economic figures don't include the expected decreases in sales tax revenue from workers' changing spending habits due to lost wages. The economic effects of the strike are localized during the first few days, Brian Peterson, the firm's director of public policy and economic analysis, said in a statement.; 0
0232.00006; Right now, cities like Detroit, Delta Township, Flint, Grand Rapids, Lansing, and Romulus are affected the most, but we're already starting to see some GM contractors and suppliers idling their facilities and temporarily laying off employees. The longer the strike persists, the more severe the effect will be.; 0
0232.00007; Even now, with the impacts localized, $9 million dollars in lost earnings is not an inconsequential amount of money.; 0
0232.00008; Nexteer Automotive, an Auburn Hills-based supplier of steering and driveline products, said it would begin temporary layoffs this week.; 0
0232.00009; Others are expected to follow suit by Monday if the strike isn't resolved, two supplier executives who spoke to Crain's on the condition of anonymity confirmed.; 0
0232.00010; Anderson Economic Group estimates the lost earnings to climb to as high as $13 million per day by next week as more and more suppliers are lay off workers due to the strike. Income tax revenue losses are also anticipated to grow to $600,00 per day by next week.; 1
0232.00011; Earlier this week, the firm said if the strike lasts until Sept. 26, the 10-day mark, Southeast Michigan would plunge into a recession. This is a dangerous situation for the Detroit-based auto economy, Patrick Anderson, president and CEO, told Crain's earlier this week.; 0
0232.00012; The roughly 46,000 union members striking at GM plants across the U.S., including Detroit-Hamtramck, Orion Township, Delta Township and others, will begin accumulating strike pay on Monday, but that won't impact lost wages because that pay comes from union dues accrued from previous paychecks, Peterson told Crain's in an email.; 0
0232.00013; On Thursday, the UAW said progress had been made on labor contract negotiations, but major issues remain unresolved, Automotive News reported.; 0
0232.00014; The bargaining committee and the UAW international staff have been working long hours each day for weeks negotiating on our members' behalf, Terry Dittes, the UAW vice president who oversees the union's GM department, said in a letter to members Thursday.; 0
0232.00015; The process of meeting in subcommittees and main tables will continue this weekend and beyond, if a tentative agreement is not reached. The main sticking points between the two sides are health insurance costs, a path to permanent employment for temporary workers, allocating product to idled plants and sharing the company's profit. GM, in its initial contract offer, requested that workers pay 15 percent of their health care costs, a leap from the 3 percent to 4 percent workers currently pay, but the company reversed that proposal and offered to keep members' payments at existing levels, sources told Automotive News.; 0
0232.00016; GM also offered to allocate an electric pickup to the Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant and battery cell manufacturing to Lordstown, Ohio. Wage and lump-sum increases each year, ratification bonuses of $8,000, improved profit sharing and $7 billion in investments, including unspecified plans for the unallocated assembly plants, were also part of the initial offer.; 0

0234.00001; Markets  Three Market Shocks and Investors Say 'No Problem' By James MackintoshWSJ  Sat., Sept. 21, 2019timer4 min. read  On Monday, oil futures jumped the most ever. On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve lost control of overnight interest rates and made emergency cash injections for the first time since the financial crisis.; 0
0234.00002; Unnerving things come in threes: The biggest swing out of stocks with momentum and into value since the financial crash happened the week before.; 0
0234.00003; Yet, stocks, bonds and the dollar are having a perfectly normal couple of weeks.; 0
0234.00004; The S&P 500 is less than 1% below July's high.; 0
0234.00005; Are investors resilient enough to recognize these as unconnected events each with its own explanation?; 0
0234.00006; Or is everyone so somnolent that they're ignoring troubles deep in the system? I lived through 2007, and watched aghast as investors ignored three sets of problems that eventually brought down the financial system.; 0
0234.00007; The subprime blowup, followed by the freezing of money markets and the crash in quantitative hedge funds, did lead to a 10% summer correction in the S&P, but stocks made it all back and only woke up to reality months later, peaking in October.; 1
0234.00008; Problems in the financial system can quickly gum up the workings of the real economy. If big overleveraged funds or brokers fail because of bad bets on oil or momentum stocks it could matter a lot. My inclination, however, is to think that this time the market and economy are showing their strength, not ignoring risks.; 0
0234.00009; The financial system is rolling with the punches.; 0
0234.00010; Each event has its own explanation, and there's no sign of damage spreading. One thing to look for is whether the specific reasons for each problem are in some way connected.; 0
0234.00011; Back in 2007, it was mostly about too much debt, everywhere.; 0
0234.00012; The subprime collapse spilled over into money-market funds that had bought securitized mortgage paper. That hit banks reliant on money markets for finance, leading to the first run on a British bank in more than a century.; 0
0234.00013; The problems this time are more amenable to understanding in their own right.; 0
0234.00014; The sudden, historic rotation last week from growth stocks into value stocks is easily explained as investors having become far too cautious, abandoning cheap, cyclical stocks. When things turned out not to be quite as bad as feared, the trade reversed, along with bond yields once it started to turn, it went very fast. The oil move made sense.; 0
0234.00015; Few were prepared for a single attack on a Saudi Arabian installation to take out 5% of the world's oil supplies, so the effect on the oil price was dramatic.; 1
0234.00016; There were few ripples on other markets, though, because even after the huge one-day jump, oil was still below where it stood in May, and long-term damage is mitigated by the promise of rapid repairs.; 0
0234.00017; YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN... The danger of these types of huge moves is that hedge funds and other leveraged traders get blown up, hitting their lenders and clients.; 0
0234.00018; But financial leverage is much lower than it used to be. And - so far at least - no serious problems have emerged.; 0
0234.00019; Let's hope they don't. More troubling is the disruption in overnight money markets.; 0
0234.00020; Dislocations there can quickly crush businesses reliant on overnight funding. In 2007, this took out banks and banklike lenders. The detailed explanation here can be read as reassuring or deeply worrying.; 0
0234.00021; In one sense the problem is too much regulation, rather than too little. In the past, U.S. banks would simply expand their balance sheets to ease any pressure in the overnight secured lending, or repo, markets. They would offer cash loans against the safety of Treasurys and make nearly risk-free profits along the way.; 0
0234.00022; But impending quarterly tests of both liquidity and size encourage the big banks not to expand too much ahead of the deadline. Meanwhile, they are absorbing a flood of Treasurys issued to finance the government's near-$1 trillion deficit. The seasonal demand for cash to pay tax bills pushed the system to the limit.; 0
0234.00023; YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN... It is reassuring that the problem isn't that the banks are wildly overleveraged or reliant on dodgy off-balance-sheet funding vehicles, as they were in 2007. It is also reassuring that the markets are now functioning again, and there is unlikely to be much direct impact even on the unlucky few who borrowed at the peak 10% annualized rate reported on Tuesday.; 0
0234.00024; That amounts to less than 0.03% for one day. While taking comfort that things haven't spread, I have niggling doubts.; 0
0234.00025; It's concerning that the financial system's plumbing can be blocked by such unexceptional events perhaps the system is more leveraged than it appears, or the Fed has tightened too much.; 0
0234.00026; It is also worrisome that the Fed was unprepared, and botched its initial attempt to calm the market.; 0
0234.00027; If liquidity can vanish so quickly from the market at the base of almost all borrowing, it's reasonable to worry that other markets could dry up, too.

0240.00003; Farfetch Limited (FTCH) Accused of Misleading Investors in IPO  According to the complaint, in September 2018, Farfetch sold approximately 50.88 million shares of Class A common stock at a price of $20 per share and raised proceeds of approximately $750.5 million. In its Registration Statement, Farfetch stated that the global market for personal luxury goods was estimated to reach a record high of $307 billion in 2017 and touted a business model that allowed for low expenditures, favorable working capital dynamics, minimal inventory holding, and an ability to drive stronger margins.; 0
0240.00004; However, Farfetch failed to acknowledge that large scale online wholesale was vulnerable to pricing pressures due to the pricing volatility and heavy promotions of luxury goods.; 0
0240.00005; These issues became evident on August 8, 2019, when Farfetch reported a larger-than-expected loss of $89.6 million for second quarter 2019, a 406.9% increase over the prior period, citing promotional discounting to compete with the heavy discounts offered by large online retailers as the reason. On this news, Farfetch's share price fell $8.12, or over 44%, to close at $10.13.; 1
0240.00006; Farfetch stock currently trades at around $9 per share, a 55% decline from its IPO price.

0241.00002; New York City prosecutors have subpoenaed President Donald Trump's tax returns, a person familiar with the matter has told The Associated Press.; 0
0241.00003; Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr's office recently sent a subpoena to Trump's accounting firm seeking the past eight years of state and federal tax returns for Trump and his company, the Trump Organization, according to the person. Vance, a Democrat, subpoenaed the Trump Organization last month for records related to payments former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen helped arrange to the porn actress Stormy Daniels after she claimed she had an affair with Trump.; 0

The firm said it believes strongly in ethical and professional rules and regulations governing the accounting industry and does not comment on work it does for clients.; 0
0241.00006; A lawyer for the Trump Organization, Marc Mukasey, said he is evaluating the situation and will respond as appropriate.; 0
0241.00007; Federal prosecutors in New York and Washington spent months probing payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign to two women who said they had affairs with Trump, including Daniels and model Karen McDougal.; 0
0241.00008; Cohen, who made one of the payments himself and arranged for American Media, the parent company of the National Enquirer, to pay the other, pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations, tax evasion and other crimes and is serving a three-year sentence. A lawyer for Cohen declined to comment. Trump, who denies any sexual relationship with either woman, has said any payments were a personal matter, not a campaign expense.; 0
0241.00009; The US attorney's office in New York informed a court last month that it was finished investigating the payments. No one besides Cohen was charged, though prosecutors said in public court filings that Trump himself was aware of and directed the payments. The Trump Organization also reimbursed Cohen for money he paid to Daniels.; 0
0241.00010; Cohen has argued that organisation officials disguised the true nature of the payments and that it is unfair he is the only one prosecuted. The federal inquiry looked at whether campaign finance laws were broken. The New York Times reported, citing people briefed on the matter, that Vance's inquiry involves an examination of whether anyone at the Trump Organization falsified business records by falsely listing the reimbursements to Cohen as a legal expense.; 0

0243.00001; Can Aurora Cannabis (ACB) Regain its Shine? ACB  -  Aurora Cannabis is the most popular stock among millennials and the most popular stock traded on the Robinhood app. By Aaron Missere  Jul 24, 2019  Join thousands of investors who get the latest news, insights and top rated picks from StockNews.com!; 0
0243.00002; The Problem  As some of you may know, Aurora Cannabis is the most popular stock among millennials and the most popular stock traded on the Robinhood app, but are investors getting impatient with the company as they continue to dilute their shares? Adding nelson Peltz to the board and giving him the option to become the company's second-largest shareholder over 4 years gave the stock a boost on speculation, but in the months after that news, the stock has performed poorly.; 0
0243.00003; Some might blame the sector, and 2019 has not been an easy year for many cannabis stocks but it has also been a year where the strong survive and the weak die off.; 0
0243.00004; We are seeing a perfect example of that in the mid to small-cap sector.; 0
0243.00005; With the S&P 500 hitting fresh all-time highs meanwhile the cannabis sector has been hitting fresh lows. This goes to show how unloved some of these highly speculative companies have been over the last few months, but Aurora is one of the biggest companies in the sector and should make it through the tough times.; 0
0243.00006; What Will it take for Aurora to Regain its shine? 9 Must Own Growth Stocks For 2019  Aurora has been up to a lot of things recently like obtaining their two outdoor grow licenses in Quebec and British Columbia, which is great news. As shareholders, we love to see that the company is focusing on expanding and thinking down the road when it comes to sustainability and research.; 0
0243.00007; We also care about profitability and execution which is two areas that Aurora could do a better job of showing its investors. When I talk about execution I am talking about the promised potential partnerships that Nelson Peltz mentioned after being appointed a special advisor to the company.; 0
0243.00008; We understand these things take time, but Aurora Cannabis is at a crucial time in their business and there are some important factors that need to be addressed.; 0
0243.00009; Cash Burn is an Issue  Aurora Cannabis is burning through cash and although not as fast as Canopy, the company also does not have $4 billion in the bank from a major investment partnership.; 0
0243.00010; This has always been an issue for Aurora and has caused massive dilution as the company is limited in its ways to raise capital.; 0
0243.00011; At their current pace, the company will have to keep diluting their shares in order to sustain expansion and I really don't think that current shareholders are going to be happy with that. The company also needs to deliver on positive EBIDTA by the last quarter in 2019 or I think that further pain will be in store for aurora shareholders if the company starts to over promise and under deliver.; 0
0243.00012; Long story short, Aurora once again has a lot of proving to do and considering a large investment partner would not be a bad idea in my opinion. Aurora Cannabis has the potential to be the most successful company in the Cannabis sector which is why Aurora Remains our number one holding, but it does not come without concerns. Aurora needs to step up to the plate, accept the fact that sometimes in business it can not be done on their own, and reward the long term shareholders like us with a stock that we feel confident to own for generations to come.; 0

0244.00001; By Investopedia  Updated May 15, 2019  Building wealth is a hot topic that sparks heated debate, promotes quirky get rich quick schemes, and drives people to pursue transactions they might otherwise never consider.; 0
0244.00002; Three Simple Steps to Building Wealth may seem like a misleading title, but it isn't. While these steps are simple to understand, they're not easy to follow.; 0
0244.00003; Basically, building wealth boils down to this: To accumulate wealth over time, you need to do three things:  You need to make it.; 0
0244.00004; This means that before you can begin to save or invest, you need to have a long-term source of income that's sufficient to have some left over after you've covered your necessities. You need to save it.; 0
0244.00005; Once you have an income that's enough to cover your basics, you need to develop a proactive savings plan. You need to invest it.; 0
0244.00006; Once you've set aside a monthly savings goal, you need to invest it prudently. This makes a simple equation:  ﻿ Savings = Income − Spending \text{Savings} = \text{Income} - \text{Spending} Savings=Income−Spending﻿  This step may seem elementary, but for those who are just starting out, or are in transition, this is the most fundamental step.; 0
0244.00007; Most of us have seen tables showing that a small amount regularly saved and compounded over time can eventually add up to substantial wealth.; 0
0244.00008; But those tables never cover the other sides of the story  -  that is, are you making enough to save in the first place? Keep in mind that there's only so much you can cut in costs.; 0
0244.00009; If your costs are already cut down to the bone, you should look into ways to increase your income.; 0
0244.00010; Also, are you good enough at what you do and do you enjoy it enough that you can do it for 40 or 50 years in order to save that money?; 0
0244.00011; There are two types of income  -  earned and passive.; 0
0244.00012; Earned income comes from what you do for a living, while passive income is derived from investments. This section deals with earned income. Those beginning their careers or in the midst of a career change can think about the following four considerations to decide how to derive their earned income:  Consider what you enjoy.; 0
0244.00013; You will perform better and be more likely to succeed financially doing something you enjoy. Consider what you're good at.; 0
0244.00014; Look at what you do well and how you can use those talents to earn a living. Consider what will pay well.; 0
0244.00015; Look at careers using what you enjoy and do well that will meet your financial expectations. Consider how to get there. Determine the education requirements, etc., needed to pursue your options.; 0
0244.00016; Taking these considerations into account will put you on the right path.; 0
0244.00017; The key is to be open-minded and proactive.; 0
0244.00018; You should also evaluate your income situation annually. You make enough money, you live pretty well, but you're not saving enough.; 0
0244.00019; What's wrong? There's only one reason why this occurs: Your wants exceed your budget. To develop a budget or to get your existing budget on track, try these steps:  Track your spending for at least a month.; 0
0244.00020; You may want to use a financial software package to help you do this. Make sure you categorize your expenditures.; 0
0244.00021; Sometimes just being aware of how much you are spending will help you control your spending habits.; 0
0244.00022; Trim the fat.; 0
0244.00023; Break down your wants and needs.; 0
0244.00024; The need for food, shelter, and clothing are obvious, but you also need to address less obvious needs. For instance, you may realize you're eating lunch at a restaurant every day.; 0
0244.00025; Bringing your own lunch to work two or more days a week will help you save money.; 0
0244.00026; Adjust according to your changing needs. As you go along, you probably will find that you've over- or under-budgeted a particular item and need to adjust your budget accordingly.; 0
0244.00027; Build your cushion  -  you never really know what's around the corner.; 0
0244.00028; You should aim to save around three to six months' worth of living expenses.; 0

Finding simple ways to save a few extra bucks here and there could include programming your thermostat to turn itself down when you're not at home, using regular unleaded gasoline instead of premium, keeping your tires fully inflated, buying furniture from a quality thrift shop, and learning how to cook.; 0
0244.00032; This doesn't mean that you have to be thrifty all the time. If you're meeting savings goals, you should be willing to reward yourself and splurge (an appropriate amount) once in a while!; 0
0244.00033; You'll feel better and be motivated to make more money. You're making enough money and you're saving enough, but you're putting it all in conservative investments.; 0

0244.00036; If you want to build a sizable portfolio, you have to take on risk, which means you'll have to invest in equities.; 0

0244.00041; Next, determine the appropriate asset allocation for you. Most likely you will need to meet with a financial advisor unless you know enough to do this on your own.; 0
0244.00042; This allocation will be based on the investment policy statement you have devised. Your allocation will most likely include a mixture of cash, fixed income, equities, and alternative investments.; 0
0244.00043; Risk-averse investors should keep in mind that portfolios need at least some equity exposure to protect against inflation.; 0
0244.00044; Also, younger investors can afford to allocate more of their portfolios to equities than older investors, as they have time on their side. Finally, diversify.; 0
0244.00045; Invest your equity and fixed-income exposures over a range of classes and styles. Do not try to time the market.; 0
0244.00046; When one style (e.g., large-cap growth) is underperforming the S&P 500, it is quite possible that another is outperforming. Diversification takes the timing element out of the game.; 0
0244.00047; A qualified investment advisor can help you develop a prudent diversification strategy. To get started investing, you will need a brokerage account. With the sheer amount of brokers to choose from, picking one can be a troublesome process.; 0

0245.00010; Finally, they can also prepare to meet regulatory compliance requirements and open new doors to future customers.; 0
0245.00011; Smart manufacturing can also reduce and avoid capital and operating costs.; 0
0245.00012; How? Manufacturers can leverage the technology to reduce labor, material usages and material waste, energy usage and rework and loss.; 0
0245.00013; Smart manufacturing improves team decision making, as it helps companies democratize data, making it available to everyone who needs it -- when they need it.; 0
0245.00014; It also helps companies streamline and automate communications throughout the manufacturing operation.; 0
0245.00015; And, maybe the most important of all, it helps people in the manufacturing company collaborate better with their customers and suppliers.; 0
0245.00016; Another important aspect of smart manufacturing is its ability to help reduce risk.; 0
0245.00017; People can quickly see, communicate and address the risks associated with the economic climate, with demand trends, with fluctuations and with disruptions in the supply chain, just to name a few. What About The Metrics? To justify a smart manufacturing investment, companies want metrics.; 0
0245.00018; So, what are the manufacturing metrics that smart manufacturing really impacts? How do you know smart manufacturing really works?; 0
0245.00019; To answer these questions, look at these specific areas where smart manufacturing can, and does, have a direct impact:   -  Labor reduction   -  Improved targeting on controllable characteristics   -  Faulty manufacture reduction   -  First pass yield improvement   -  Raw material variance reduction   -  Throughput increases   -  Testing supplies reduction   -  Finished goods and inventory reduction   -  Process variation reduction and improved targeting   -  Work practices   -  Capital reduction   -  Percentage of overpack  A Profitable Balancing Act  To stay competitive and in business, companies must be profitable.; 0
0245.00020; Today's consumers expect high-quality products on demand, along with quick response times and service. Manufacturers must come up with a reasonable balance between the customers who want higher-quality products for less cost, the employees who want higher salaries and the shareholders who want a greater return on their investment.; 0
0245.00021; At the same time, they need to be environmentally sustainable, socially responsible and able to take care of their people and customers.; 0
0245.00022; They can't do any of this without being profitable.; 0
0245.00023; Since the connected enterprise and big data were introduced to the industry more than a decade ago, smart manufacturing technology builds on the benefits gleaned from the past and helps companies move forward to do great things.; 0
0245.00024; But how do you know whether smart manufacturing is right for your business? Ask yourself a series of questions, such as:   -  What are the steps you need to take to align your existing infrastructure to your business goals, objectives and strategies?; 0
0245.00025; -  How do you select the right technology, justify the costs and ensure a strong return on investment (ROI)?   -  Do you need to make data accessible and usable enterprise-wide to ensure a deeper understanding of facility operations and product life cycles?; 0
0245.00026; -  Do you require faster connectivity to equipment to capture, collect and store real-time mission-critical data to make data-driven business decisions?; 0
0245.00027; -  Do you require faster time-to-market, improved production processes and reduced risk? Of course, each answer is dependent on your facility requirements.; 0
0245.00028; All questions, however, require one key element to solve: data. Data is a strategic asset and extremely valuable as a differentiator in the marketplace.; 0
0245.00029; That's what smart manufacturing is all about. It helps improve business efficiency and enhance operational process capabilities.; 0
0245.00030; Several industries jumped on the new data technology bandwagon years ago, as they were the least regulated and they understood the value of process data.; 0
0245.00031; Other industries, however, have been slower to adopt new technology as they must meet strict regulatory compliance standards and best practices. Many manufacturers in these industries have already started to identify smarter systems and devices that will help them improve their competitive edge, while also maintaining the integrity of their strict regulatory compliance requirements.; 0
0245.00032; In some cases, those tools include smart manufacturing solutions. Whether your company is getting started with smart manufacturing to take advantage of all the bottom-line benefits or using these tools for other reasons, smart manufacturing should ultimately be about quickly and easily moving manufacturing capabilities to where and when they're needed, based on market needs and the competition.

0250.00001; Posted on September 22, 2019 by ICAN - ICAN News  ICAN Joins National Consumer Campaign Alliance  Ask ICAN's financial counsellors how many clients present with hardship issues relating to payday loans and consumer leases, and they will tell you it's the majority. Although Small Amount Credit Contracts (SACCs) may not always be the obvious driver for someone seeking financial counselling, it's often the underlying cause.; 0
0250.00002; Vulnerable people  -  whether they are working or not  -  sign up for these short-term high-interest loans in desperation, not understanding what it will really cost them, both financially and emotionally. The 'Stop the Debt Trap Alliance', is a group of 20 consumer, non-profit and community services groups, campaigning for the implementation of the recommendations from an independent government review of SACCs.; 0
0250.00003; The alliance, led by the Consumer Action Law Centre, recently descended on Canberra for a national day of action, calling on the federal parliament to enact laws to combat the business practices of payday lenders and consumer lessors. The proposedlegislation would ensure that no more than 10% of a consumer's income would be spent on loan repayments, including a cap on the total amount of payments to be made under a consumer lease.; 1
0250.00004; ICAN joined the Debt Trap campaign because our financial counselling team sees the detriment these products cause on a daily basis, they're targeting people that can least afford them, said ICAN CEO Aaron Davis. We have firsthand knowledge of the problems Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians face when accessing goods and services, and why we need reform.; 0
0250.00005; Consumer Action Law Centre CEO, Gerard Brody, says so many people are caught off guard because payday lenders and consumer lease providers deliberately target vulnerable people and, under current laws, can get away with charging high fees and taking huge portions of people's incomes to pay off the loans. Payday lenders do not conduct effective affordability checks, and they can charge exorbitant fees with equivalent interest rates of between 100 and 400 per cent per annum.; 0
0250.00006; It's about money, not mateship  ICAN Financial Counsellor Unaisi Buli deals with the fallout every day.; 0
0250.00007; One of the first things we do for our clients is to look at their bank statements so that we can work out their money story. If payday lenders did the proper affordability checks, they, like us, would know when someone is already overcommitted.; 0
0250.00008; Instead, they provide another unaffordable loan so that a person, or their whole family, spiral into a debt crisis where basic needs like rent, electricity, and food get sacrificed to keep up with the unconscionable payments. It's not just loans that payday lenders offer it's a relationship, something that frustrates ICAN's financial counselling team.; 0
0250.00009; As Sharon Edwards explains, the relationship that our clients have with payday lenders is like a double-edged sword. People come to us with the view that the payday lender is their best mate, they're there for them in a time of need, when there are little or no options for support elsewhere. Some lenders make it their business to remember birthdays and kids names.; 0
0250.00010; Of course, these are just sales tactics. If payday lenders actually cared about the vulnerable people that walk through their doors, they would support the proposed reforms.; 0
0250.00011; ICAN continues to see many people struggling throughout North Qld with complex financial counselling needs, including a significant number of insolvency cases, insurance advocacy matters and family/relationship breakdowns due to spiralling debt stress. Add unaffordable payday loans into the mix, and it is no wonder people feel like giving up.; 0
0250.00012; Not seeing a way out of the debt trap and being unable to get any financial traction for life's basic demands, including back to school expenses, or car rego has dire effects on physical and mental wellbeing.; 0
0250.00013; As Sharon puts it, just because there is a demand for something, it doesn't mean that it's a solution.; 0
0250.00014; There needs to be a significant increase in the availability of safe, affordable, fair finance options for people in need.; 0
0250.00015; Assistant Treasurer Michael Sukkar said the government was currently considering public submissions to consultation on a suite of reforms to SACCs and consumer leases. Our response to the Review of the Small Amount Credit Contract Laws supported the vast majority of the Review's recommendations, including caps on charges and borrowing amounts, Sukkar said.; 0
0250.00016; We recognise the need for reform in these areas and that reforms must strike the right balance in enhancing consumer protection, while also ensuring these products and services can continue to fulfil an important role in the economy, Sukkar said.; 0

0251.00002; National newspaper The Telegraph report this afternoon that Webber has agreed a three-year extension to his current deal, hot on the heels of Saturday's landmark victory over reigning champions Manchester City at Carrow Road. It's understood the report is accurate, following on from talk of a new deal earlier in the season. City head coach Daniel Farke put pen to paper on a new long-term deal in March and majority shareholders Delia Smith and Michael Wynn Jones suggested they would like Webber to follow suit in an interview last month.; 0

The weak development in China, where assets fell by 3.4%, played a key role in this.; 1
0252.00002; However, other important emerging markets such as Mexico and South Africa also had to absorb significant losses in 2018.; 0

0252.00006; The price of low yields  At the same time, fresh savings set a new record.; 0
0252.00007; They increased by 22% to more than EUR 2,700 billion.; 1
0252.00008; The increase in the flow of funds, however, was solely driven by US households, who  -  thanks to the US tax reform  -  upped their fresh savings by a whopping 46% two thirds of all savings in industrialized countries thus originated in the US.; 0
0252.00009; But the analysis of fresh savings in 2018 reveals another peculiarity: Savers seemed to turn their backs on the asset class of insurance and pensions.; 0
0252.00010; Its share in total fresh savings has fallen from more than 50% before and immediately after the crisis to a mere 25% in 2018.; 0
0252.00011; And while US households increased in return their demand for securities, all other house-holds preferred bank deposits (and sold securities): In Western Europe, for example, two thirds of fresh savings ended up in bank coffers worldwide, bank deposits remained the most popular destination for fresh savings, for the eighth year in a row.; 0
0252.00012; This penchant for liquid and supposedly safe assets costs savers dearly, however: Losses suffered by households as a result of inflation are expected to have risen to almost EUR 600 billion in 2018.; 0

0253.00001; Frydenberg's $2.9trn super question Treasurer Josh Frydenberg is a skillful enough politician to recognise the potential dangers in allowing the Future Fund free rein to expand its role in super. Share Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has adroitly sidestepped some ticklish political issues in his planned retirement income review, but there is one super question that he'll find much more difficult to dodge  -  whether to give the Future Fund carte blanche to compete in the country's $2.9 trillion superannuation industry. At present, people blame their super fund manager whenever the investment returns for the year are miserable.; 0
0253.00002; David Rowe There's no doubt that there's a superficial appeal in allowing the $162.6 billion government-owned Future Fund to set up a new consumer fund that would actively compete for members with retail and industry super funds. After all, the Future Fund delivered a stunning 11.5 per cent return in the year to June 2019, eclipsing the performance of most top super funds.; 1
0253.00003; And over the past decade, the Future Fund has achieved annualised returns of 10.4 per cent, well ahead of its 6.5 per cent target.; 0
0253.00004; This impressive investment performance explains why Canberra is toying with the idea of using the Future Fund to spice up competition in the super industry,  which is still riddled with large numbers of funds delivering lacklustre returns, while continuing to charge hefty fees.; 0
0253.00005; Advertisement Of course, the proposal has the added advantage that the heft of the Future Fund can be used as a counterweight to the growing power of the union-affiliated industry funds.; 0
0253.00006; But Frydenberg should be extremely wary of the politicial risks of becoming swept up in the enthusiasm for expanding the Future Fund's role. After all, Future Fund chairman and former Liberal federal treasurer Peter Costello, himself warned last month that it is becoming harder to generate outsized investment returns.; 0
0253.00007; We still see very big risks in the years ahead and we think it's going to be harder to make returns, said Costello, who is also chairman of Nine Entertainment Co, which owns The Australian Financial Review.; 0
0253.00008; There are good reasons for Costello's caution.; 0
0253.00009; Prices of longer-dated assets - such as property and infrastructure - have soared as global long-term bond yields have plunged close to historic lows.; 0
0253.00010; This has boosted the performance of the Future Fund, which quite properly holds a higher proportion of long-term assets in its portfolio than most funds. The problem is that the unprecedented plunge in bond yields can't be repeated, which means that prices for long-term illiquid assets won't benefit from the same boost as in the past.; 0
0253.00011; A second factor is that the Future Fund has a greater weighting to offshore assets than most of its competitors. As the the Australian dollar has declined, the value of these international investments has jumped.; 0
0253.00012; Advertisement With the currency now trading at US68¢, however, it's unlikely that the future falls in the currency will be as steep as in the past.; 0
0253.00013; The big problem for the government is that no matter how much Costello emphasises the risks to future investment returns,  millions of Australians will pay absolutely no heed. They'll pour their super savings into the Future Fund in the misplaced optimism that its stellar past performance will continue indefinitely.; 0
0253.00014; This means that they'll inevitably be disappointed and angry if, as seems likely, the Fund's investment returns fails to live up to their unrealistic expectations. Their disgruntlement will be even greater if - as is highly probable - the Future Fund's new public fund fails to match the performance of its original fund which was set up to manage the pension liabilities of public servants.; 0
0253.00015; This discrepancy in performance reflects the fact that it will be impossible for the new fund to exactly duplicate the same mix of long-term investments as the Future Fund's original portfolio.; 0
0253.00016; What's more, it often takes a considerable time for long-term investments - such as infrastructure assets - to increase in value. It's a highly risky move for politicians - who are at the mercy of a three year electoral cycle - to entice investors to switch their super savings into funds where the returns materialise over a much longer time-frame. And it also means that politicians will inevitably find themselves in the firing line when financial markets tumble, and asset prices fall.; 0
0253.00017; At present, people blame their super fund manager whenever the investment returns for the year are miserable. Expanding the Future Fund's role in super is a sure way of ensuring that in future this bitterness will be aimed squarely at Canberra.; 0

0256.00001; Print  Home | Wire | How Central Banks Promote Money-Creation by Private Banks  How Central Banks Promote Money-Creation by Private Banks 0 Views  Tags Money and BanksMoney and Banking  2 hours agoFrank Shostak  Some commentators consider fractional reserve banking as a major vehicle for the expansion in the money supply growth rate.; 0
0256.00002; What is the nature of this vehicle? Fractional reserve banking arises because banks legally are permitted to use money placed with them in demand deposits. Banks treat this type of money as if it was loaned to them.; 0
0256.00003; However, is this really the case?; 0
0256.00004; When John places $100 in a safe deposit box with Bank One he does not relinquish his claim over the $100.; 1
0256.00005; He has an unlimited claim against his money.; 0
0256.00006; Likewise, when he places $ 100 in a demand deposit at Bank One he also does not relinquish his claim over the deposited $100.; 1
0256.00007; Also in this case John has an unlimited claim against his $100.; 0
0256.00008; Now let's assume that Bank One takes $50 out of John's demand deposit without getting any consent from John in this regard and lends this to Mike.; 0
0256.00009; By lending Mike $50, the bank creates a deposit for $50 that Mike can now use.; 1
0256.00010; Remember that John still has an unlimited claim against the $100 while Mike has now a claim against $50.; 0
0256.00011; What we have here that the Bank One has generated an extra spendable power to the tune of $50. We can also say that Bank One has $150 deposits that are Bank's One liabilities, which are supported by $100 cash, which are Bank One's reserves. Note that the reserves comprise 66.7% of Bank's One deposit liabilities.; 0
0256.00012; This example indicates that Bank One is practicing fractional reserve banking. Although the law allows for this type of practice, from an economic point of view, this results in money out of thin air which leads to consumption that is not supported by production, (i.e., to the dilution of the pool of real wealth). According to Mises,  It is usual to reckon the acceptance of a deposit which can be drawn upon at any time by means of notes or checks as a type of credit transaction and juristically this view is, of course, justified but economically, the case is not one of a credit transaction. ...; 0
0256.00013; A depositor of a sum of money who acquires in exchange for it a claim convertible into money at any time which will perform exactly the same service for him as the sum it refers to, has exchanged no present good for a future good.; 0
0256.00014; The claim that he has acquired by his deposit is also a present good for him. The depositing of money in no way means that he has renounced immediate disposal over the utility that it commands.1  Similarly, Rothbard argued,  In this sense, a demand deposit, while legally designated as credit, is actually a present good  -  a warehouse claim to a present good that is similar to a bailment transaction, in which the warehouse pledges to redeem the ticket at any time on demand.2  Why a Free Unhampered Market Would Limit Fractional-Reserve Banking In a truly free market economy, the likelihood that banks will practice fractional-reserve banking will tend to be significantly lower than in a system with a central bank.; 0
0256.00015; In an unhampered market, if a particular bank tries to practice fractional-reserve banking it runs the risk of not being able to honor its checks.; 0
0256.00016; For instance, if Bank One lends out $50 to Mike out of $ 100 deposited by John, it runs the risk of going bankrupt.; 0
0256.00017; Let us say that both John and Mike have decided to exercise their claims.; 0
0256.00018; Let us also assume that John buys $100 worth of goods from Tom while Mike buys goods for $50 from Jack.; 0
0256.00019; Both John and Mike pay for the goods with checks against their deposits with Bank One. Now Tom and Jack deposit their received checks with their bank  -  Bank B, which is a competitor of Bank One.; 0
0256.00020; Bank B in turn presents these checks to Bank One and demands cash in return.; 0
0256.00021; However, Bank One has only $ 100 in cash  -  it is short $50.; 0
0256.00022; Consequently, Bank One is running the risk of going bankrupt unless it can quickly mobilize the cash by selling some of its assets or by borrowing.; 0
0256.00023; The fact that banks must clear their checks will be a sufficient deterrent to the practice of fractional-reserve banking in a free market economy.; 0
0256.00024; Furthermore, it must be realized that the tendency of being caught practicing fractional-reserve banking, so to speak, rises when there are many competitive banks. As the number of banks rises, and the number of clients per bank declines, the chances that clients will spend money on goods from individuals that are banking with other banks will increase.; 0
0256.00025; This in turn will increase the risk of the bank not being able to honor its checks once the bank begins the practice of fractional-reserve banking.; 0
0256.00026; Conversely, as the number of competitive banks diminishes, that is as the number of clients per bank rises, the likelihood of being caught practicing reserve banking is diminished.; 0
0256.00027; In the extreme case if there is only one bank it can practice fractional-reserve banking without any fear of being caught, so to speak.; 0
0256.00028; Thus if Tom and Jack are also clients of Bank One, then once they deposit their received checks from John and Mike, the ownership of deposits will be now transferred from John and Mike to Tom and Jack.; 0
0256.00029; This transfer of ownership, however, will not cause any effect to Bank One.; 0
0256.00030; We can then conclude that in a free market, if a particular bank tries to expand credit by practicing fractional-reserve banking, it runs the risk of being caught.; 0
0256.00031; Hence in a truly free market economy the threat of bankruptcy will bring to a minimum the practice of fractional-reserve banking.; 0
0256.00032; The fact that banks must clear their checks will be a sufficient deterrent in many cases to the practice of fractional-reserve banking in a free market economy.; 0
0256.00033; The practice will not be prevented in its entirety, but market competition will work to localize and limit its effects.; 0
0256.00034; The presence of a central bank removes the free market deterrent from banks to generate money out of thin air. By injecting monetary reserves to the banking system, the central bank can dictate the increase in money supply via the fractional reserve banking.; 0
0256.00035; According to the popular way of thinking, if the Fed injects $1 billion into the economy and banks have to hold only 10% in reserves against their deposits, this will cause the first bank to lend 90% of this $1 billion.; 1
0256.00036; The $900 million in turn will end up with the second bank, which will lend 90% of the $ 900 million.; 0
0256.00037; The $810 million will end up with a third bank, which in turn will lend out 90% of $ 810 million and so on. Consequently, the initial injection of $1 billion will become $10 billion (i.e., the money supply will expand by a multiple of 10).; 1
0256.00038; Observe that banks respond to the initial injection of $1 billion by the Fed, which coupled with the legal reserve requirements of 10%, sets in motion the monetary expansion of $ 10 billion.; 1
0256.00039; In this framework, banks are responding to the injection of reserves by the central bank.; 0
0256.00040; However, does all this make much sense given that the central banks in the world today do not target money supply but rather set targets for the overnight interest rate like the federal funds rate in the United States? Surely then the entire multiplier model must be suspect. Indeed economists from the post-Keynesian school of economics (PK) have expressed doubt about the validity of the popular framework.; 0
0256.00041; In the present monetary framework, it is held the job of the central bank is to ensure that the level of cash in the money market is in tune with the interest rate target.; 0
0256.00042; For instance, if on a particular day the government intake of cash exceeds outlays, this leads to a deficiency of cash in the money market on that day.; 0
0256.00043; To prevent a scramble for cash in the money market and a subsequent increase in the overnight interest rate, the central bank must inject an appropriate amount of cash in order to keep the interest rate at the target. Note that the central bank here is performing a balancing act, or so it is held. The PK school of thought maintains that, central banks do not actively pursue monetary pumping to influence various economic data in the economy the central bank is just aiming at keeping the money market well balanced.; 0
0256.00044; (The exception to this is 2008 when the Fed aggressively pumped money to the economy to counter the economy sliding into a depression - the belief held by the then Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke).; 0
0256.00045; In this way of thinking, it would appear that the central bank has nothing to do, at least directly, with an expansion in the money supply.; 0
0256.00046; The key source of money expansion, it is held, is commercial banks via an expansion in lending that set in motion an expansion in the money supply.; 0
0256.00047; (For PK economists, the demand for loans, plus the willingness of banks to lend, determines the quantity of loans and thus of deposits created).; 0
0256.00048; The supply of loans, in this way of thinking, is never independent of demand  -  banks supply loans only because someone is willing to borrow.; 0
0256.00049; To conclude, then, according to this way of thinking, the driving force of bank-credit expansion  -  and thus money-supply expansion  -  is the increase in the demand for loans and not the central bank as the money multiplier model presents. Superficially, it does make sense to conclude that central bank policies are of a passive nature and central banks just aim at keeping the money market in balance.; 0
0256.00050; In reality, central banks are far from being passive.; 0
0256.00051; In fact, without central banks being active it would be impossible for banks to expand lending. Here is why.; 0
0256.00052; Let us say that for whatever reason banks are experiencing an increase in demand for loans.; 0
0256.00053; Also, let us assume that the supply of loanable funds is unchanged. According to PK, bank loans will increase.; 0
0256.00054; The demand-deposit accounts of the new borrowers will now also increase.; 0
0256.00055; Obviously, the new deposits are likely to be employed in various transactions.; 0
0256.00056; After some time elapses, banks will be required to clear their checks and this is where problems might occur. Some banks will find that to clear checks they are forced either to sell assets or to borrow the money from other banks (remember the pool of loanable funds remains unchanged).; 0
0256.00057; Obviously, all this will put an upward pressure on money-market interest rates and in turn on the entire interest-rate structure.; 0
0256.00058; To prevent the rise in the overnight interest rate above the interest-rate target, the central bank will be forced to pump money.; 0
0256.00059; Therefore, the conceptual outcome as depicted by the multiplier model remains intact here. The only difference is that banks initiate the lending process, which is then accommodated by the central bank. It follows then that the expansion of large amounts of credit out of thin air cannot emerge without the support from the central bank.; 0
0256.00060; The modern banking system can be seen as one huge monopoly bank which is guided and coordinated by the central bank.; 0
0256.00061; Banks in this framework can be regarded as branches of the central bank. For all intent and purposes the banking system can be seen as one bank.; 0
0256.00062; (Note that a monopoly bank can practice fractional-reserve banking without running the risk of being caught.); 0
0256.00063; If the expansion of credit out of thin air requires the support of the central bank then one can infer that, in a free market without the central bank, the likelihood of such an expansion emerging is not very high. Again, if a particular bank tries to expand credit without the backup from a genuine lender  -  i.e., practicing fractional-reserve banking  -  it runs the risk of not being able to honor its checks, which raises the risk of bankruptcy.; 0
0256.00064; In a free market then, without the central bank, the fact that banks must clear their checks is likely to be a sufficient deterrent to the practice of fractional-reserve banking. Finally, not only does fractional-reserve banking gives rise to monetary inflation it is also responsible for monetary deflation. Since banks by means of fractional-reserve banking generate money out of thin air, then whenever they do not renew their lending they in fact give rise to the disappearance of money.; 0
0256.00065; This must be contrasted with lending of genuine money, which can never physically disappear unless it is physically destroyed.; 0
0256.00066; Thus when John lends his $50 via Bank One to Mike the $ 50 is transferred to Mike from John.; 1
0256.00067; On the day of the maturity of the loan Mike transfers to Bank One $50 plus interest.; 0
0256.00068; The bank in turn transfers the $50 plus interest adjusted for bank fees to John  -  no money has disappeared.; 0
0256.00069; If however, Bank One practices fractional-reserve banking and lends the $ 50 to Mike out of thin air, then on the day of maturity when Mike repays the $50 the money goes back to the bank  -  the original creator of this empty money, i.e., money disappears from the economy, or it vanishes.; 1
0256.00070; From this we can also conclude that the fractional reserve banking which is supported by the central bank is the key to the menace of the boom-bust cycle. We can also conclude that in a truly free market the likelihood for boom-bust cycle to emerge will tend to be low. Ludwig von Mises, (Indianapolis, Ind: Liberty Classics, 1980), pp. 300 - 01.

0258.00009; In particular, research that is conducted to reduce the burdens caused by the racial disparities in cancer incidence requires bioethical guidance. For these reasons, the Bioethics Shared Resource (BESR) is an integral component of this Partnership.; 0
0258.00010; For full/pilot projects, the BESR provides consultation and collaborative support regarding ethical issues from design to implementation and assists in the development of grant proposals, abstracts, and manuscripts. In addition to its work supporting the research of Partnership investigators, the BESR enhances the bioethical capabilities of the Partnership participants. This is accomplished by providing education in bioethics to investigators, junior faculty, post-doctoral fellows, medical residents, graduate/undergraduate and medical students, community health advisors, navigators, partners, and other Partnership personnel regarding sound applications of bioethical principles in cancer research.; 0

0259.00011; Mr Shapps added: Though I do think we need to leave it to due process to see whether that would be appropriate. The collapse of Thomas Cook means that employees, through no fault of their own, are out of their jobs  -  including those in Harlow.; 0

0261.00001; That thudding sound you hear is the sound of the global economy slowing down. In the United States, growth has decelerated to a meager pace of around 1.5 per cent a year, according to IHS Markit surveys of purchasing managers published on Monday. In Europe, the same surveys indicate German factories are in deep recession while the overall Eurozone economy is barely growing at all.; 0
0261.00002; In Canada, gross domestic product is likely to expand by only about 1.3 per cent this year, according to Bank of Canada estimates.; 0
0261.00003; Meanwhile, in China, industrial production grew at its slowest pace in 17 years in August.; 0
0261.00004; Story continues below advertisement  No wonder so many investors feel uneasy. A recent survey of more than 200 of the world's biggest asset managers by Absolute Strategy Research in London found they see a 52 per cent chance of a global recession next year.; 0
0261.00005; It is the first time since the survey began in 2014 that these well-informed money managers put the likelihood of a recession at more than 50 per cent. The widespread pessimism among the smart-money crowd suggests that now is a good time to be cautious.; 0
0261.00006; But it is not exactly a flashing alarm. Despite their gloom on the state of the global economy, the respondents in the Absolute Strategy survey also said they expect stocks to perform better than bonds over the next year.; 0
0261.00007; Their faith in stocks despite slowing growth is not as odd as it may seem.; 0
0261.00008; Most stock markets around the world now deliver substantially more in dividends than bonds pay out in yield.; 0
0261.00009; So long as companies continue to deliver those payouts, people have good reason to hold onto their shares. Rather than running for shelter, investors may want to consider exactly how much volatility they can comfortably endure.; 0
0261.00010; The answer is likely to hinge on how you see three threats to investor confidence playing out over the next year. The first and most obvious threat is the potential for an all-out trade war.; 0
0261.00011; The U.S. and China have spent the past few months slapping tariffs on each other's goods. Time after time, they have hurled threats, then backed off and agreed to talk things out.; 0
0261.00012; As long as the uncertainty persists, few companies will be eager to make big investments, and that will chill global trade.; 0
0261.00013; The second threat is politics.; 0
0261.00014; The U.S. presidential campaign is just beginning to heat up.; 0
0261.00015; Until voters actually cast their ballots on Nov. 3, 2020, investors won't know whether to count on another four years of government-by-tweet.; 0
0261.00016; On top of that, there is massive uncertainty around Brexit as well as the continuing threat of more turmoil in the Middle East. The third threat is evidence that labor unrest is beginning to move from rhetoric to reality.; 0
0261.00017; This past week's walkout by General Motors workers in the U.S., and a short-lived strike by British Airways pilots demonstrate wage pressures are growing.; 0
0261.00018; After a decade of unimpressive salary growth, many employees want a bigger piece of the pie. Story continues below advertisement  Perhaps stock prices will overcome the combined threats from trade, politics and wage demands. But investors should be braced for twists and turns.; 0
0261.00019; At Capital Economics, for instance, chief markets economist John Higgins expects U.S. stocks to lose about 16 per cent between now and year end as earnings fall short of expectations and the U.S. Federal Reserve fails to deliver as much in the way of lower interest rates as investors are expecting.; 1
0261.00020; Bonds will generate small, but positive, returns in that scenario. But he then sees Wall Street rebounding as the U.S. manages to steer clear of a recession. Over 2020 and 2021, he expects U.S. stocks to produce annual average gains in excess of 10 per cent, while bond prices edge downward.; 0
0261.00021; Given the inherent uncertainty of market forecasts, it is probably best not to put too much faith in any exact schedule for asset shuffles.; 0
0261.00022; The broader message is that neither stocks nor bonds seem guaranteed to produce steady gains over the next couple of years. Until the current threats resolve themselves, that is unlikely to change.; 0

0261.00039; Story continues below advertisement  Answer: I've got some good news and some bad news.; 0
0261.00040; The good news is that you can obtain an official Statement of Contributions and an estimate of your future monthly Canada Pension Plan benefits by logging in to your My Service Canada account. Or you could call the Canada Pension Plan at 1-800-277-9914.; 0
0261.00041; The estimate will show how much you could receive if you start CPP at the age of 60 (the earliest you can apply), 65 or 70.; 0
0261.00042; The earlier you start, the less you will receive.; 0
0261.00043; For a 65 year old, the maximum CPP monthly retirement pension is currently $1,154.58.; 1
0261.00044; Now the bad news: The estimate won't necessarily be accurate.; 0
0261.00045; If you'll be starting CPP soon  -  say you're 58 and plan to retire at 60  -  the estimate should be pretty close to the actual amount you will receive.; 0
0261.00046; But if you're retiring at 55 and want to know how much CPP you'll get if you wait until 65, the government's estimate could be too high.; 0
0261.00047; That's because the estimate formula effectively assumes that your average annual pensionable earnings  -  adjusted for inflation and low-income years that you are allowed to drop out  -  will continue until you start CPP. If you don't contribute for a decade, your actual benefit will be lower  -  perhaps much lower  -  than the estimate.; 0

0262.00003; Filmmakers trail her with cameras she goes on international speaking tours and once sold out a basketball arena in Italy. Kelton is the foremost evangelist of a fringe economic movement called Modern Monetary Theory, which, in part, argues that the government should pay for programs requiring big spending, such as the Green New Deal, by simply printing more money. This is a polarizing idea.; 0

So M.M.T. proposes that the constraint on government spending shouldn't be debt but inflation: How much new money can you pump into the economy before prices rise?; 0

0262.00017; I don't see anyone - I mean, I'll just be honest, I don't really see any Presidential candidates putting forward ambitious agendas and saying, 'We're not going to try to pay for any of this.'; 0
0262.00018; I saw Ann's face register various states of shock.; 0
0262.00019; She mouthed, What?!; 0
0262.00020; It's a tough sound bite, the moderator, the Journal's financial editor, Charles Forelle, said.; 0
0262.00021; Kelton replied, It is, right? She went on, What we've done to ourselves is to just leave trillions of dollars, literally, on the table, by not taking advantage of the fiscal space that we have, by running our economies below potential, by living below our means as a nation, year after year after year.; 0
0262.00022; The session wound down.; 0
0262.00023; Forelle said. Hands up if anybody's got a question.; 0
0262.00024; He peered out at the audience.; 0
0262.00025; Oh! We've got a lot of questions!; 0
0262.00026; Kelton often hears the same concerns about M.M.T., and most are about inflation. How soon will we become Zimbabwe, which printed so many Zimbabwean dollars that inflation peaked, in 2008, at an annual rate of ninety sextillion per cent?; 0
0262.00027; Never, according to Kelton under M.M.T., the focus is sustainable inflation, whereas fiscal traditionalists worry about the deficit and don't consider inflation at all.; 0
0262.00028; Doesn't M.M.T. then require accurate forecasting of inflation risk?; 0
0262.00029; Yes, and, Kelton conceded at the festival, the models aren't perfect, but we can do a pretty good job.; 0
0262.00030; And, anyway, government spending, she believes, is responsible for just a small part of inflation.; 0
0262.00031; Ann raised her hand but didn't get called.; 0
0262.00032; When it was over, I caught up with her. Did you hear me just say 'Holy cow'? she said.; 0
0262.00033; It just seems like it's exactly backward.; 0
0262.00034; But she did it so well that I can't figure out why. I asked Ann whether she found Kelton convincing.; 0
0262.00035; I mean, kind of! she said.; 0
0262.00036; I know what she said was brilliant I just can't believe her. She's gotta be wrong.; 0
0262.00037; Kelton believes that, though M.M.T. is a new framework, it builds on old ideas found buried and forgotten in the work of foundational economists. The first person to begin assembling the pieces was a hedge-fund executive named Warren Mosler.; 0
0262.00038; A polymath with an iconoclastic streak, Mosler shopped around his ideas about money creation and the deficit in the early nineties, looking for allies and finding none. Working some connections, he eventually, in 1993, scored a meeting with Donald Rumsfeld, who was then working as an executive in the private sector.; 0
0262.00039; Rumsfeld said he could spare an hour at the Racquet Club of Chicago, in the steam room. Both men wore towels.; 0
0262.00040; When they emerged from the muggy haze, Mosler had won an ally.; 0
0262.00041; Rumsfeld agreed to set up Mosler with a few economist friends.; 0
0262.00042; Most helpful was Art Laffer, the architect of supply-side economics, whose lifework, arguing for reducing taxes on the rich, recently earned him the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Donald Trump. Laffer had popularized the contentious notion that reducing taxes can actually increase tax revenues. Mosler, by contrast, wanted to prove that tax revenues were irrelevant to government spending.; 0
0262.00043; But Laffer helped Mosler workshop his ideas and directed him to a group of post-Keynesian economists who ran a boisterous Listserv - a Reddit for the dial-up age.; 0
0262.00044; Mosler logged on and found the economists who became M.M.T.'s founding thinkers.; 0
0262.00045; Today, Mosler lives in St. Croix, a U.S. territory where he can avoid paying ninety per cent of his federal income tax. (This is an actual U.S., federally sponsored program, he told me. I'm doing my patriotic duty.); 0
0262.00046; Mosler estimated that he has contributed about three million dollars to the M.M.T. movement in the course of a couple of decades, and, if anything, I get kind of defensive about not having spent more. thought. Kelton first encountered M.M.T. in the mid nineteen-nineties, when, as a graduate student at Cambridge University, she came across Mosler's online agitating.; 0
0262.00047; Kelton applied for a fellowship at the Levy Institute, where many of the early M.M.T. thinkers had gathered.; 0
0262.00048; There, in 1998, she authored one of M.M.T.'s foundational texts, a paper titled Can Taxes and Bonds Finance Government Spending?; 0
0262.00049; The paper concludes that taxes don't actually pay for anything - that the federal government spends first, then taxes some of that money back later. from the New School, then was hired by U.M.K.C.; 0

0262.00052; While at U.M.K.C., in 2008, Kelton unsuccessfully challenged a Republican incumbent for a seat in the Kansas legislature.; 0
0262.00053; She campaigned on economic issues and pitched her commitment to fiscal discipline.; 0
0262.00054; (M.M.T. spending theories don't apply at the state level, because states can't create more currency.) She offered tepid support for abortion and said that she believed that marriage is defined as a bond between a man and a woman.; 0
0262.00055; (Kelton now says she has supported gay marriage from her earliest thinking on the issue.) She told me that she's been asked about running for the U.S. Senate, from Kansas, but doesn't want to relocate her two school-age children. Since 2017, Kelton has been a professor at Stony Brook, and she has a visiting appointment at the New School.; 0
0262.00056; Several of Kelton's colleagues told me that she can be playfully funny, but, when we met, in a New School conference room overlooking Fifth Avenue, she spoke with the intense focus and faith of a crusader. For Kelton, M.M.T. would form the basis of a new approach to policymaking, in which our political imagination is broadened. The important question, she said, shouldn't be How will you pay for it? but How will you resource it?; 0
0262.00057; She uses the mobilization for the Second World War as an example the country focussed on maximizing its resources to make planes and guns and food.; 0
0262.00058; The deficit was not a concern. In the economy that Kelton envisions, spending would rise and fall with the economic cycle.; 0
0262.00059; Sometimes, if the economy were overheating, the government might call for a budgetary surplus.; 0
0262.00060; This is, basically, standard Keynesianism: spending during downturns, which then tapers as the economy reaches full employment.; 0
0262.00061; Kelton and others add a federal jobs-guarantee program - she calls it an automatic stabilizer. When the economy tanks, more people enter the program, and spending increases. When the economy improves, people move on to better, private jobs, and spending shrinks.; 0
0262.00062; Winning, for me, looks like prioritizing human outcomes over budget outcomes, she told me.; 0
0262.00063; Winning looks like handing the Congressional Budget Office a piece of legislation and saying, 'This legislation is designed to lift ten million kids out of poverty.; 1
0262.00064; Tell me, will it be successful?; 0
0262.00065; Tell me, does it carry inflation risk?; 0
0262.00066; Do I have the offsets right?' And then we vote. The current economic conditions look pretty good for M.M.T.; 0
0262.00067; In Japan, where deficits are high and the interest rate is set at less than zero, the economy has met with no calamity.; 0
0262.00068; When Congress passed a tax cut in 2017, the C.B.O. predicted that there would be a jump in interest rates caused by the deficit. This hasn't happened.; 0
0262.00069; Still, most mainstream economists view M.M.T. as the Cult of the Magic Money Tree, deriding what they see as its theorists' preference for analogy over mathematical modelling or empirical evidence. What most concerns me is I can't actually quite figure out what it is, Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist and Times columnist, told me.; 0
0262.00070; Krugman is a political progressive, and he agrees with many of the spending programs that M.M.T. proponents support.; 0
0262.00071; But, he said, I'll be damned if I can figure out what it is exactly that they think. The rhetorical simplicity that frustrates professional economists is, for a layman, part of M.M.T.'s appeal.; 0
0262.00072; A framework called sectoral balances undergirds much of the theory. Kelton, in her speeches and writing, likes to explain it this way: the government and the private sector are on two sides of a balance sheet.; 0
0262.00073; If the government has a deficit, the private sector must have a surplus.; 0
0262.00074; Their red ink is our black ink, Kelton said.; 0
0262.00075; This is a useful model, but, in the real world, the math isn't as clean.; 0
0262.00076; When the government spends, most of the money ends up in the hands of the people, but there are leakages on the way - to international markets, most significantly.; 0
0262.00077; (Also, to corruption.); 0
0262.00078; Interest rates, too, are heavily influenced by the global economy. If the American government has a deficit, the private sector has a surplus.; 0
0262.00079; But whose private sector?; 0
0262.00080; One frequent critique of M.M.T. is that it's basically Keynesianism with some social-media-influencer branding.; 0
0262.00081; This elides a few important differences between the two schools of thought, including how each handles the interest rate. According to most mainline economists, the bigger the deficit the more the government has to borrow, which means that, past a certain point in the economic cycle, the interest rate may have to go up.; 0
0262.00082; This stifles private investment and chokes off growth. Kelton argues that the Fed can, and should, set the interest rate near zero - problem solved.; 0
0262.00083; Abstract economic questions being what they are, this debate is not likely to kill at parties. But the interest-rate question is perhaps the key difference between M.M.T. and Keynesianism.; 0
0262.00084; framework, with the interest rate set near zero, Congress would take on the Fed's dual mandate to control inflation and reduce unemployment.; 0
0262.00085; If inflation is expected to rise, this could present Congress with tough decisions on spending and taxing that neither political party wants to make.; 0
0262.00086; It's helpful advice for some political universe that I've never visited, Krugman said.; 0
0262.00087; At the moment, interest rates remain stubbornly low. Krugman told me that, in this environment, he actually agrees that the deficit isn't much of an issue.; 0
0262.00088; He just finds M.M.T. inscrutable and its policies unrealistic. The jobs guarantee, he said, would offer a fine economic stabilizer, but it would never get passed.; 0
0262.00089; Were people like me arguing, frantically, for more government spending of one sort or another to prop up the economy when interest rates hit zero?; 0
0262.00090; The answer is yes!; 0
0262.00091; Krugman told me. I don't know how much more vehement we could've gotten.; 0
0262.00092; But we didn't get it.; 0
0262.00093; To say, 'Ah, but this wouldn't be a problem if we had a federal jobs guarantee' is true but not really helpful. These fundamental criticisms extend across the political spectrum.; 0
0262.00094; Glenn Hubbard, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush, told me that M.M.T. raised a few interesting questions, but that it has no coherent framework at all.; 0
0262.00095; Like Krugman, he thought that expecting Congress to fulfill the Fed's role demonstrated breathtaking naïveté.; 0
0262.00096; Hubbard, who has warned consistently about the dangers of debt, was also an architect of George W. Bush's tax cuts, which added an estimated three hundred billion dollars per year to the deficit.; 1
0262.00097; But Hubbard argued that the private-sector gains from the cuts would be worth the added deficit, and he said he never denied that the country would have to pay off that debt in one of two ways: taxes or inflation. I think the country can have more debt than it has now.; 0
0262.00098; I view that as an open and interesting question that we can talk about, Hubbard said. But the free lunch is just silly.; 0
0262.00099; No serious person believes this. For several years, Kelton's most prominent supporter has been Bernie Sanders.; 0
0262.00100; But even he has used M.M.T. as more of a provocation than a prescription.; 0
0262.00101; In December, 2014, Sanders, then the incoming ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee, was looking for a chief economist. He called Kelton.; 0
0262.00102; Kelton recalled that Sanders asked what she would do if she were him. I said, 'What do you mean? If I were you, Senator Sanders?; 0
0262.00103; Or if I were you, maybe I'm going to run for President?'; 0
0262.00104; Both, he suggested. My instinct was that this was more than just taking a position for the Senate Budget Committee, she told me.; 0
0262.00105; This had the potential to be part of something more exciting.; 0
0262.00106; Kelton worked for the Democrats throughout the 2015 budget negotiations and became an adviser to Sanders's Presidential campaign that spring.; 0
0262.00107; Sanders, however, has never offered an endorsement of M.M.T. When asked, in February, how he planned to pay for his policies, Sanders responded, Am I going to demand that the wealthy and large corporations start paying their fair share of taxes? Damn right, I will!; 0
0262.00108; Kelton and Mosler believe that taxing the wealthy does nothing for a big program like the Green New Deal: taxes don't fund spending, after all, and wealth taxes won't control inflation.; 0
0262.00109; If you did an ambitious Green New Deal, two to three trillion a year over ten years, and you tried to pay for it with a wealth tax, you'd get massive inflationary pressures, Kelton told me. You've removed all the income from people who aren't going to spend it. To remove cash from the monetary base, and thereby offset inflation, you have to tax the people who spend most of their income - the poor or middle classes.; 0
0262.00110; (According to M.M.T., the converse is also true - if you want to spur growth, tax cuts should target the poor and middle class.); 0
0262.00111; Mosler told me that he has met with Sanders's staffers, and many of them expressed a familiarity with M.M.T.; 0
0262.00112; The staff read my book. They're all really good with this stuff, he said.; 0
0262.00113; But Bernie doesn't go there.; 0
0262.00114; They kind of roll their eyes and say, 'Look, we try.'; 0
0262.00115; Mosler has his own remedy for inequality, but it's so counterintuitive that it catches people out, he said. Part of it is to eliminate the federal income tax entirely, corporate and individual.; 0
0262.00116; And replace it with just a property tax.; 0
0262.00117; When I mentioned the idea to Kelton, she said that Mosler's proposal would make sense, in theory, if the country's tax system could be redesigned from scratch, but that it's not realistic. If you say, 'Eliminate the corporate income tax,' Bernie's head would explode, she said.; 0
0262.00118; Warren Gunnels, Sanders's staff director, told me that Sanders hired Kelton because they agree on the policies that form Sanders's platform. She's one of the leading economists who's trying to create an economy for all, he said.; 0
0262.00119; We need more economists like her.; 0
0262.00120; But, he said, M.M.T. never really crossed our mind, to be honest.; 0
0262.00121; We never looked at M.M.T. as a theory that we should adopt. would be a mistake.; 0
0262.00122; She went on, Senator Sanders knows that Congress needs to be able to spend without that artificial constraint. Presidential candidate Sanders, like every other presidential candidate, is trying not to get called out by literally everyone for proposing stuff he 'can't pay for.'; 0
0262.00123; You have to know this is how the game is played.; 0
0262.00124; Kelton is mostly alone among the M.M.T. crowd in this view of Sanders. James Galbraith, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin and an M.M.T.; 0
0262.00125; supporter, was an economic adviser to the Sanders campaign in 2016, but he told me that he considered himself more of a fan than a counsellor. The fact is that Bernie Sanders doesn't need a lot of advice from people like me.; 0
0262.00126; He knows exactly what he wants to do, Galbraith said.; 0
0262.00127; perspective.; 0
0262.00128; Kelton is perhaps more pragmatic than most academics.; 0
0262.00129; Randall Wray, the economist who helped develop M.M.T., traced Kelton's moves: scholarship to blog to Twitter to Washington. These are all things normal academic-type people don't want to do at all, he said.; 0
0262.00130; And then getting involved more directly with Bernie. Even though he has never come out with a strong endorsement of M.M.T., it really doesn't matter.; 0
0262.00131; It gave the access, for her, to the media.; 0
0262.00132; He's going to have the right policy proposals.; 0
0262.00133; Whether Sanders endorses M.M.T., he said, is sort of irrelevant.; 0
0262.00134; For the moment, most of the major M.M.T. thinkers are staunch progressives.; 0
0262.00135; But M.M.T.'s politics are difficult to categorize. It can lead you to the left or the right, Kelton told me.; 0
0262.00136; You could use it to say we should have tax cuts to lower unemployment. Mosler, who used to identify as a Tea Party Democrat, told me that he speaks to Tea Party groups about M.M.T. and is received warmly.; 0
0262.00137; Kelton often exchanges ideas with John Carney, an economics columnist at Breitbart, who considers himself a fellow-traveller of the M.M.T.; 0
0262.00138; movement.; 0
0262.00139; I think, functionally, Donald Trump has a lot of M.M.T. in him, Carney told me. He doesn't think we need to cut Social Security.; 0
0262.00140; He doesn't think that the deficit is a problem for the United States government right now.; 0
0262.00141; He thinks that if you can borrow cheaply you should and that interest rates should be low.; 0
0262.00142; Those are all positions that the M.M.T. people would agree with. The idea for the job guarantee, he added, is very close to what Make America Great is. We don't want welfare, we don't want handouts, we want good jobs for the American people.; 0
0262.00143; Carney predicted more support for M.M.T. from the right once politicians realize that it can justify deep tax cuts.; 0
0262.00144; This shift, if it is to occur, seems far off.; 0
0262.00145; Earlier this year, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez publicly expressed interest in M.M.T. Subsequently, five Republican senators, led by David Perdue, of Georgia, introduced a resolution that sought to offer an official condemnation of M.M.T.; 0
0262.00146; The resolution demonstrated M.M.T.'s growing clout, but it also underscored the fact that Kelton's battle is over M.M.T.'s legitimacy, not its politics.; 0
0262.00147; Allies are valuable.; 0
0262.00148; Maybe just the fact that she's e-mailing with a Breitbart editor is a sign that she wants a broad evangelism for M.M.T. and not just to be a darling of the left, Carney said. But he noted that there are fraught political decisions to be made. The way I put it is, can the government build a gun range?; 0
0262.00149; Is that an O.K. job-guarantee job?; 0
0262.00150; Can the job guarantee be used to build a border wall?; 0
0262.00151; I asked Kelton if she worries at all about these fights, further over the horizon.; 0
0262.00152; At the end of the day, what I really hope for is just a better debate, she told me.; 0
0262.00153; Let both sides put forward their best ideas.; 0
0262.00154; This is the ultimate dream of M.M.T.: freed from false financial shackles, we could debate, on honest terms, the most fundamental political questions. If money weren't an issue, would we want to scrub carbon from the atmosphere?; 0
0262.00155; Pay for reparations? Expand ICE?; 0
0262.00156; Maybe we just want to be left alone, with our tax money in our pockets and some Social Security checks when we age. M.M.T.'s architects describe their vision as encompassing not just a better economy but a better, healthier body politic - a goal that is, given the state of things, almost certainly doomed, but is admirable nonetheless. Deficits do matter - not just the financial ones.; 0

0263.00001; Alabama education chief wants $300 million more for teachers and classrooms in 2021 Updated Sep 13, 2019 Posted Sep 13, 2019  By Trisha Powell Crain | tcrain@al.com  Though the current school year has barely started, Alabama K-12 education officials are already looking ahead to the 2020-21 budget year.; 0
0263.00002; And Alabama Superintendent Dr. Eric Mackey has a bold ask for lawmakers for next year's education budget: an additional $300 million on top of the nearly $5 billion allocated to K-12 schools for the 2020 budget year, which starts Oct. 1.  It's about more money in the classrooms, Mackey said.; 0
0263.00003; More than $190 million of the additional money requested would add nearly 1,900 teachers and give them $1,000 each---up from this year's $600---to support classroom and students needs.; 1
0263.00004; After the presentation, Board Vice President Jeff Newman, R-Millport, said after living through the recession and the impact it had on schools, seeing this proposal was good news.; 0
0263.00005; It's an absolute pleasure, Newman said, to add the things we've really needed for a long time.; 0
0263.00006; Mackey presented the budget proposal during a work session of the state board of education on Thursday afternoon in Montgomery. Alabama school report card: New & improved, see it here  The latest redesign of the Alabama K-12 school report card was unveiled during a state board of education work session on Thursday.; 0
0263.00007; The two big asks we had are around more teachers, making sure that the pay and benefits are good enough to recruit people into teaching and that teachers are well supported in the classroom, Mackey said. Mackey said the K-12 budget will go through a lot of hands and a long process before lawmakers make a final decision, and that his proposal is based on needs, not wants. We think that we need to be honest about what the need is, Mackey said, and then see what the limits are on the funds that are available.; 0
0263.00008; All indications are that the money will be there, Mackey said, as education trust fund receipts are up from current year predictions.; 0
0263.00009; State lawmakers passed a $7.1 billion education budget for 2020, $500 million more than 2019 and the largest ever in sheer dollar amounts, which included a 4% raise for teachers.; 0
0263.00010; Lawmakers will convene in February to consider the 2021 budget. Here's how much each Alabama school spent on students in the 2017-18 school year  New spending data shows how much money officials spent at each of Alabama's schools during the 2017-18 school year.; 0
0263.00011; Voters go to the polls in March to vote on a Constitutional Amendment to decide whether they want to keep the elected state school board or convert the board to one appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate. Alabama is one of six states . To add more teachers, Mackey wants to lower the divisors, which are used to determine how many certified teachers the state provides funding for, for nearly all grade spans.; 0
0263.00012; While not directly correlated to class size, lower divisors mean more teachers, which ultimately lowers class sizes, Mackey said. Lowering the divisors will cost $139.5 million, Mackey said.; 1
0263.00013; If the proposal is enacted by lawmakers, it would be the first time that divisors in all grade spans are below 20, Mackey said.; 0
0263.00014; Another big increase Mackey wants is in the amount of money called classroom instructional support that is given to teachers for materials for students and classrooms. The image below, taken from Mackey's presentation, reflects the current amounts and the proposed amounts. The total increase means spending nearly $50 million more than is currently being spent, he said.; 1
0263.00015; We want to go big on a request for classroom instructional supplies, he told board members. Mackey, a former teacher, said lawmakers have told him it's unlikely they'll raise the amount from $600 to $1,000 per teacher for student materials, it's important to ask.; 0

0267.00001; Long Ideas | Tech  Jack Henry & Associates May Be Close To A Breakout |  About: Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.; 0
0267.00002; (JKHY)  by: Individual Trader  Individual Trader  Contrarian, gold & precious metals, dividend growth investing, newsletter provider  Summary  Shares topped out in 2018 after a multi-year long rally. We have an ascending triangle in play. An ascending triangle has definite forecasting implications.; 0
0267.00003; Trend following is at the core of our technical analysis approach. We always aim to either trade or invest in alignment with the underlying trend. This means that patience is key.; 0
0267.00004; In fact, professional traders at any given time could have 5 to 10 times more stocks on their watchlists than their live positions in their portfolio.; 0
0267.00005; The key is to wait for the trend which you are looking for to develop. Once a new trend is in motion and has been established, it is more likely that the trend will continue. In fact, the more connection points an uptrending trend line has, the stronger that trend line should act as support.; 0
0267.00006; For example, if we look at the multi-month trend line of Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.; 0
0267.00007; (JKHY), we can see that the decade long trend line contains at least four contact points. When we take this account along with the fact that the trend line, as mentioned, is over a decade long, we believe the trend line as a result is quite significant.; 0
0267.00008; Now, many would state that the stock is overvalued. Jack Henry & Associates currently trades with a sales multiple of 7.3, which is more than twice what the industry trades for.; 0
0267.00009; However, the technical chart is saying nothing of the sort. As we can see from the chart above, price has twice over the past 10 months come down to test that trend line.; 0
0267.00010; Both times, support held firm. If we go to a more recent chart, we can see that we seem to have a multi-week symmetrical triangle in play.; 0
0267.00011; In fact, shares managed to close above the upper part of the triangle just a few weeks ago.; 0
0267.00012; If we have a clean break-out, the price target would be somewhere in the region of $200 a share.; 1
0267.00013; We have plotted a parallel trend line to illustrate the upside potential here on a successful breakout. However, volume should have increased significantly on that breakout especially a triangle which is close to one-year in duration.; 0
0267.00014; Upon close inspection of the volume numbers below, it can be seen that the heavier daily volume is taking place on the downmoves and not on the upmoves. Therefore, we would not trust this breakout at this moment in time. Lower lows (at least on the daily chart) look like they, maybe, are on the cards.; 0
0267.00015; This is the problem with the symmetrical triangle.; 0
0267.00016; At its core, it is a neutral pattern despite the fact that more often than not, it ends up resulting in a continuation pattern. All is not lost, though. We also (shown below) have a potential ascending triangle pattern in play.; 0
0267.00017; These patterns are more trustworthy and are always bullish irrespective of where they appear on a chart.; 0
0267.00018; A bullish breakout is when we see a clear closing above that upper horizontal trend line.; 0
0267.00019; Again, we would be looking for a significant increase in buying volume to confirm the breakout.; 0
0267.00020; The price target for the ascending triangle is pretty straightforward. It is just the addition of the maximum height of the triangle and the horizontal trend line price.; 0
0267.00021; Many times, future earnings estimates are not reflected on the technical chart.; 0
0267.00022; If we get our breakout, then one would feel that Jack Henry & Associates would have a good chance of achieving those numbers. Net earnings growth topped out at $4.85 per share in June 2018.; 0
0267.00023; However, consensus is predicting that earnings will grow from its current position by around $2 per share over the next four years. To sum up, shares of Jack Henry & Associates have been enjoying a multi-year rally, and it doesn't look like the long-term trend is in jeopardy.; 0
0267.00024; Shares may have topped out in late 2018 but look close to a breakout once more. We will post to the back-office if we take this trade on.; 0
0267.00025; Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in JKHY over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.; 0

0268.00009; Clifford authored a 2017 study on similar tax foreclosures and home equity theft in Massachusetts. In an email to The Center Square, Clifford state: The U.S. Constitution contains what is known as the Due Process Clause, which is found in the 14th Amendment.; 0
0268.00010; It prohibits states from taking individual's property without just cause.; 0
0268.00011; Further, it requires both that the state provide notice to the individual that property may be taken and that a hearing be provided before a neutral party (i.e., a judge).; 0
0268.00012; Clifford continued: When a state takes the excess equity from a taxpayer above the amount that is owed (with appropriate interest and costs), it is taking property without just cause, he said. In the Massachusetts procedures, the tax collector can take the property on his or her own without submitting the claim to a judge or other neutral magistrate.; 0
0268.00013; Both of these violate the 14th Amendment Due Process Clause.; 0
0268.00014; When asked what steps he would recommend to remedy tax foreclosures that result in government claiming 100 percent of the proceeds, Clifford responded: First, the states should be required to give any excess proceeds received back to the taxpayer.; 1
0268.00015; Second, in Massachusetts, the tax collector must be required to establish the right to take the property for taxes before doing so.; 0

0272.00001; Share  September 13, 2019  Rare Daily Staff  Castle Creek Pharmaceutical Holdings, the parent of Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals, has reached an agreement to acquire Fibrocell Science, a cell and gene therapy company developing treatments for skin and connective tissue diseases. Under the terms of the deal, Castle Creek will pay Fibrocell shareholders $3 per share, a 63 percent premium to its 30-day volume all-cash price for a total consideration of approximately $63.3 million, including repayment of debt and other financial instruments, in cash.; 1
0272.00002; The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2019 with Fibrocell becoming a privately held subsidiary of Castle Creek Pharmaceutical Holdings. Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals says Fibrocell's pipeline will augment its late-stage topical ointment under development for the treatment of epidermolysis bullosa simplex, a group of rare genetic skin conditions that cause the skin to blister and tear with minimal contact. Following our licensing agreement to develop and commercialize FCX-007, our experience working together on rare dermatological conditions caused us to quickly realize that Castle Creek and Fibrocell could achieve even greater synergies by combining the companies into one, said Greg Wujek, CEO of Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals.; 0
0272.00003; With Castle Creek's resources, Fibrocell's gene therapy platform can be advanced into additional areas of high, unmet need  -  with the potential to develop multiple promising new therapies.; 0
0272.00004; Fibrocell's portfolio includes FCX-007, an experimental, late-stage stage gene therapy for the treatment of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), a rare congenital and progressive skin disease caused by the deficiency of the protein COL7.; 0
0272.00005; RDEB is life-threatening with no approved cure or treatment. FCX-007 is a genetically modified autologous fibroblast that encodes the gene for COL7.; 0
0272.00006; By genetically modifying autologous fibroblasts ex vivo to produce COL7, culturing them and then treating wounds locally via injection, FCX-007 offers the potential to address the underlying cause of the disease by providing high levels of COL7 directly to the affected areas while avoiding systemic distribution.; 0
0272.00007; A pivotal phase 3 clinical trial was initiated in late July 2019, and if successful, a Biologics License Application (BLA) filing is expected in 2021.; 0
0272.00008; The portfolio also includes FCX-013, an experimental gene therapy candidate for the treatment of moderate to severe localized scleroderma.; 0
0272.00009; FCX-013 is an autologous fibroblast genetically modified using lentivirus and encoded for matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), a protein responsible for breaking down collagen. FCX-013 is currently enrolling for the first portion of a phase 1/2 clinical trial.; 0
0272.00010; FCX-007 and FCX-013 have both been granted Orphan Drug designation, Rare Pediatric Disease designation, and Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. FCX-007 has also been granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designation by the FDA.; 0
0272.00011; We believe that combining with Castle Creek has a strong strategic rationale, as they have the expertise and resources necessary to continue the development of both FCX-007 and FCX-013, potentially bringing these and additional novel products to patients in need, said John Maslowski, president and CEO of Fibrocell.

0276.00001; BBC News › Sports › 2 hours ago  The storm passed and Wales emerged from it unscathed. Typhoon Tapah had pummelled Japan's southern island of Kyushu but further north in Toyota, where Wales faced Georgia in their opening World Cup fixture, there was little more than a light breeze. A comprehensive win amid calm - albeit humid - conditions came as a relief for Wales, who had already navigated a tempest of their own in the build-up to this game.; 0
0276.00002; Just six days before the start of their campaign, backs coach Rob Howley was sent home following an alleged breach of betting regulations, seemingly plunging Welsh preparations for the tournament into disarray. But this is a resilient Wales side, forged in adversity. During the Six Nations earlier this year, players put aside the disruption of merger talks between two of their main regional sides Ospreys and Scarlets - and the potential loss of jobs - to secure a hard-earned victory over Scotland in Edinburgh.; 0
0276.00003; That set them up for a Grand Slam triumph and, here on world rugby's grandest stage, they were similarly robust in the face of off-field turbulence.; 0
0276.00004; Yes, this was a Georgian side Wales were expected to beat - but the context was significant and the chaotic backdrop to this fixture might have derailed lesser teams.; 0
0276.00005; Instead, it galvanised Wales.; 0
0276.00006; Players need no added motivation at a World Cup, though head coach Warren Gatland praised senior figures for shouldering more responsibility following Howley's departure, while forwards coach Robin McBryde described the squad as circling the wagons as they harnessed a siege mentality to combat the outside noise.; 0
0276.00007; You just have to draw a line in the sand and move on. You can't change the past and what's happened.; 0
0276.00008; You have to look forward, said Gatland. I said to the players beforehand, I thought they've been outstanding this week.; 0
0276.00009; The way they've prepared for this match, the way they've trained. The way the senior players have stepped up. Everyone was really looking forward to getting out on the pitch.; 0
0276.00010; The departure of Howley, who had been by Gatland's side throughout his 12-year tenure with Wales, was unmistakably the end of an era for this side.; 0
0276.00011; And yet in this time of change, one of the most pronounced features of Wales' dominant first-half display against Georgia was continuity. Jonathan Davies and Josh Adams' tries both came from the first phase of plays, each score flowing in its build-up and precise in its execution.; 0
0276.00012; Stephen Jones, drafted in as Howley's replacement, had only been working with the squad a few days, though these moves demonstrated how the players had helped make the transition a smooth one by taking leading roles in training.; 0
0276.00013; Gatland was pleased, even if he felt like something - or more pertinently someone - was missing as he watched from the stands without Howley.; 0
0276.00014; It was definitely strange, he said.; 0
0276.00015; You've just got to give Stephen as much support as you possibly can.; 0
0276.00016; He's fitted in seamlessly.; 0
0276.00017; He's been doing a good job. It was a little bit strange but you have to think and move forward.; 0
0276.00018; Ready for the Wallabies? Wales were at full strength for this encounter but Gatland will have had one eye on what is likely to be the Pool D decider against Australia on Sunday.; 0
0276.00019; A commanding 29-0 half-time lead against Georgia gave the New Zealander the luxury of being able to replace his leading players after the interval, in order to give them some additional rest before facing the Wallabies. And while Gatland did use his bench, the changes were not unusually sweeping or early.; 0
0276.00020; They did, however, contribute to a fragmented final quarter in which Wales failed to reproduce their fluent first-half form against a reinvigorated Georgian side.; 0
0276.00021; I thought we were pretty clinical [in the first half] and probably let things slip a bit in the second half, said Gatland.; 0
0276.00022; That probably did not help because we were losing some continuity and making some changes with the subs and bringing people off, trying to think about keeping players as fresh as we possibly can with the six-day turnaround. The match against Australia will have a major bearing on both sides' World Cup prospects, with the victor likely to top the pool and earn a potentially more favourable draw in the knockout stages. Wales will enter the fixture with greater belief than they might have done a year ago, with their win over the Wallabies in Cardiff last November ending a 13-match losing streak against the Australians which stretched back to 2009.; 0
0276.00023; I think we can take a lot of confidence from that, they're a tough side, said Gatland.; 0
0276.00024; It's tough with a six-day turnaround, and I know all teams have to face it at some point in this competition, the short turnaround period.; 0
0276.00025; We've got to make sure we recover well and then start really planning and looking forward to what will be a tough fixture against Australia.; 0
0276.00026; We have a few things up our sleeve that we haven't shown yet, that will hopefully be ready for next week. Can't see this selector?; 0

0278.00001; Advertisement  Supported by  Image  Thomas Cook passengers in Mallorca, Spain, found themselves stranded on Monday after the airline suddenly ceased operations.CreditCreditEnrique Calvo/Reuters  By Michael Wolgelenter  LONDON  -  The tour operator and airline Thomas Cook said on Monday that it had collapsed, forcing hundreds of thousands of travelers to scramble to find a way home, after last-minute negotiations to obtain necessary financing for the debt-ridden company fell apart.; 0
0278.00002; We are sorry to announce that Thomas Cook has ceased trading with immediate effect, the company said in a post on Twitter, and the Civil Aviation Authority in Britain said that all Thomas Cook bookings, including flights and vacations, had been canceled, affecting an estimated 600,000 people around the world.; 1
0278.00003; The liquidation of the world's oldest travel company, which specialized in low-cost package vacations that included flights and accommodation in more than 60 destinations around the world, has set in motion what was being described as the biggest peacetime repatriation in British history, as the government announced plans to bring back 150,000 Britons.; 1
0278.00004; The Civil Aviation Authority said that the first repatriation flight had left from Kennedy Airport in New York with more than 300 passengers on board and was expected to land at about 5 p.m. in London.; 0
0278.00005; Thomas Cook was struggling with debts approaching £2 billion, forcing it to enter negotiations with shareholders and creditors that came at least £200 million short of what was needed to keep the company running.; 1
0278.00006; With no other choice, the company ceased operations. Before the collapse, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government would not intervene to save the airline, adding that doing so would create a moral hazard because the possibility of a government bailout could encourage other companies to take risks.; 0
0278.00007; Condor, an airline that is a subsidiary of Thomas Cook, said it was seeking financial help from the German government to keep its planes in the air after the collapse of the company, which impacted around 140,000 German travelers.; 1

0278.00011; The BBC reported that the government had chartered 45 jets to get people home.; 1
0278.00012; Airlines including easyJet, British Airways and Virgin were providing planes, the BBC said, with some being flown in from as far away as Malaysia.; 0
0278.00013; The aviation authority told passengers who were booked on Thomas Cook Airlines flights not to go to British airports, as your flight will not be operating, and warned that the repatriation effort would not include any outbound flights from Britain.; 0
0278.00014; It also noted that it had contacted the hotels hosting Thomas Cook customers, who booked their accommodation as part of a package, to tell them that the cost of their stay will also be covered by the government.; 0
0278.00015; The announcement alleviated fears that travelers would be unable to leave their hotels until payment was settled.; 0

The effects of the collapse will ripple out far from Britain, the headquarters of Thomas Cook. In Greece, where 50,000 vacationers are expected to be repatriated to their home countries in the coming days, there are fears about the effect of the company's collapse on the local economy.; 0

I have been awake for 28 hours now, Mr. Roche, a 30-year-old civil engineer, said in a message on Monday, while he and Ms. Wells, 31, were on their way to Birmingham to find an alternative flight. The couple had already paid about 4,000 pounds, or about $5,000, for alternative flights for themselves and some family members, and they were expecting to spend another £2,000 for their accommodation.; 1

0278.00022; The failure of Thomas Cook touched off a debate in Britain over whether the government should have intervened to prevent the collapse.; 0
0278.00023; Speaking to the British television network ITV, Mr. Shapps, the transport secretary, said that beyond the fact that governments don't usually go around investing in travel companies, a bailout of Thomas Cook would most likely have only put off the inevitable by stretching things out for a couple of weeks.; 0
0278.00024; The company were asking for up to £250 million, he said on Good Morning Britain.; 0
0278.00025; They needed about £900 million on top of that, and they've got debts of £1.7 billion, so the idea of just spending taxpayers' money on that just wasn't really a goer.; 0

0278.00027; But he also noted that, there is now little doubt that the Brexit process has led many U.K. customers to delay their holiday plans for this summer. The travel operator got its start in 1841, when a cabinet maker  -  and the man for whom the company is named  -  suggested a special route to carry temperance supporters from Leicester to a meeting in Loughborough, 12 miles away.; 0
0278.00028; The company later expanded with trips to continental Europe and North America, and, according to its website, had sales of £7.8 billion and 19 million customers each year. Visitors to the company's website on Monday were greeted with a sparse gray screen with the company's logo informing them of the collapse.; 0
0278.00029; Thomas Cook UK Plc and associated UK entities have entered Compulsory Liquidation and are now under the control of the Official Receiver, the website read, instructing customers to visit a special Civil Aviation Authority website that had been established. Most British travelers on package vacations should be able to get home without suffering any financial loss. British law requires that those trips be insured under the Air Travel Organizer's License, which is intended to reimburse travelers if their tour operator stops doing business.; 0
0278.00030; But those who only bought flights from Thomas Cook do not have the same protections and will be more reliant on personal travel insurance.

0280.00001; Seeking Alpha  Portfolio Strategy  |  About: Altria Group, Inc.; 0
0280.00002; (MO)  by: David Pinsen  David Pinsen  Portfolio strategy  Summary  Altria got a bit of good news on Friday, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch reiterating its buy rating on the stock.; 0
0280.00003; At the same time though, the credit default swaps market was signaling a warning flag for Altria: a 6% chance of default over the next 5 years. That chance of default had climbed from 4% last Monday. For cautious bulls looking to limit their downside risk in light of that, I show ways of doing so while staying long.; 0
0280.00004; A 1953 ad in the Saturday Evening Post for Altria's Philip Morris brand (photo via Pinterest).; 0
0280.00005; Seeking Alpha News Editor Clark Schultz noted a bit of good news for Altria (MO) on Friday (Altria in the spotlight): Bank of America's (BAC) Merrill Lynch unit reiterated its buy rating on the stock, which is trading at its lowest earnings multiple in 10 years.; 0
0280.00006; That buy rating is consistent with the average rating of Seeking Alpha contributors on the stock.; 0
0280.00007; Screen capture via Seeking Alpha  Given the value tilt of many Seeking Alpha contributors, their current bullish rating is understandable.; 0
0280.00008; In contrast, Seeking Alpha Essential's Quant Rating, which takes into account momentum in addition to value and three other sub-components, was neutral on the stock. Although Merrill Lynch's reiterated buy rating was good news for Altria shareholders, there was a bit of bad news regarding spreads on the company's senior 5-year default swaps, as Bloomberg's Brian Chappatta tweeted last Monday.; 0
0280.00009; As Chappatta wrote there, those spreads implied a 4% chance of an Altria default over the next five years.; 1
0280.00010; On Friday, I asked Chappatta for an update.; 0
0280.00011; He replied that the spreads had widened since Monday, and as of Friday implied a 6% chance of default over the next five years.; 1
0280.00012; Given that warning flag from the credit default swap market, below are a couple of ways cautious Altria bulls who want to stay long can limit their risk.; 0
0280.00013; For the two examples below, I have assumed you own 1,000 shares of Altria and can tolerate a drawdown of 20%, but not one larger than that. Rather than use the same time to expiration for both hedges, in each case, I have selected the one with the lowest annualized cost for that type of hedge. I've circled the annualized cost as a percentage of position value in the screen captures below.; 0
0280.00014; Uncapped Upside, Positive Cost  As of Friday's close, these were the optimal, or least expensive, put options to hedge 1,000 shares of MO against a greater than 20% decline by next month. Screen capture via the Portfolio Armor iPhone app  The cost here was $190, or 0.47% of position value.; 0
0280.00015; That worked out to 6.54% of position value annualized, which was the lowest annualized cost of any of the available option expiration dates when hedging with optimal puts.; 0
0280.00016; Note that for significantly larger positions in Altria, the app may mention another potential form of uncapped protection which doesn't involve options.; 0
0280.00017; Capped Upside, Negative Cost  As of Friday's close, this was the optimal, or least expensive, collar to hedge 1,000 shares of MO against a >20% decline by late March, if you were willing to cap your possible upside at 10% by then. Screen capture via the Portfolio Armor iPhone app  The cost here was negative, meaning you would have collected a net credit of $270, or 0.66% of position value, when opening this hedge.; 1
0280.00018; That worked out to an annualized cost of -1.34% of position value annualized, which was the lowest annualized cost of any of the available option expiration dates when hedging with an optimal collar.; 0
0280.00019; Wrapping Up - Neutral On Altria Last time I wrote about Altria, I mentioned that of the 2,082 securities that passed both of my site's two preliminary screens, it was ranked #555. Because it was ranked higher than the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) then, I gave it a bullish rating.; 0
0280.00020; On Friday, it failed the first of my site's two preliminary screens, so it wasn't ranked.; 0
0280.00021; Because it passed the second screen, I have given it a neutral rating here.; 0
0280.00022; Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).; 0

0284.00001; WeWork's Neumann gives up control, CEO role following investor revolt 6 Min Read (Reuters) - WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann agreed on Tuesday to resign as chief executive and give up majority voting control, after SoftBank Group Corp ( 9984.T ) and other shareholders turned on him over a plunge in the U.S. office-sharing start-up's estimated valuation.; 0
0284.00002; The decision came after We Work parent We Company postponed its initial public offering last week following push-back from perspective investors, not just over its widening losses, but also over Neumann's unusually firm grip on the company.; 0
0284.00003; This was a blow for SoftBank, which was hoping for We Company's IPO to bolster its fortunes as it seeks to woo investors for its second $108 billion Vision Fund.; 0
0284.00004; SoftBank invested in We Company at a $47 billion valuation in January.; 0
0284.00005; But investor skepticism led to the start-up considering a potential IPO valuation earlier this month of as low as $10 billion, Reuters reported.; 1
0284.00006; We Company had vowed to press ahead with an IPO by the end of the year. But there was little sign that IPO investor sentiment would change, threatening the value of the stakes, not just of outside investors in the company, but of Neumann as well. What was the venture capital world's biggest upset then morphed into one of corporate America's most high-profile boardroom dramas.; 0
0284.00007; SoftBank managed to muster enough opposition to Neumann in a meeting of We Company's seven-member board on Tuesday to convince him to step down.; 0
0284.00008; Reuters had reported on Monday that Neumann had engaged in talks about changes to his role. In recent weeks, the scrutiny directed towards me has become a significant distraction, and I have decided that it is in the best interest of the company to step down as chief executive, Neumann said in a statement.; 0
0284.00009; Artie Minson, currently chief financial officer of WeWork parent We Company, and Sebastian Gunningham, a vice chairman for the New York-based start-up, will become co-chief executives, the company said. Neumann will stay on the board as non-executive chairman, the company added.; 0
0284.00010; Minson will oversee We Company's finance, legal, human resources, real estate and public communications, while Gunningham will take responsibility for  product, design, development, sales, marketing, technology and regional teams.; 0
0284.00011; Neumann also agreed to reduce the power of his voting shares, losing majority voting control, according to the sources.; 0
0284.00012; Each of his shares will now have the same voting rights as three We Company common shares, not the 10 common shares previously, the sources said.; 0
0284.00013; Related Coverage Neumann's shares used to have the same voting power as 20 We Company common shares, before he agreed to reduce his grip  slightly earlier this month in an unsuccessful attempt to make the IPO more attractive to investors.; 0
0284.00014; We Company said on Tuesday it was now evaluating the optimal timing for an IPO.; 0
0284.00015; FIRM GRIP Neumann, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $2.2 billion, developed a cult following among many We Company employees, vowing to elevate the world's consciousness as he sought to establish WeWork as a brand that transcended office sharing.; 0
0284.00016; While his investors were willing to entertain his eccentricities over the last decade that he has led WeWork since its founding in 2010, his free-whiling ways and party lifestyle came into focus once he failed to get the company's IPO underway.; 0
0284.00017; During the company's attempts to woo IPO investors this month, Neumann was criticized by corporate governance experts for arrangements that went beyond the typical practice of having majority voting control through special categories of shares. These included giving his estate a major say in his replacement as CEO, and tying the voting power of shares to how much he donates to charitable causes.; 0
0284.00018; Neumann also entered several transactions with We Company over the years, making the company a tenant in some of his properties and charging it rent.; 0
0284.00019; He has also secured a $500 million credit line from banks using company stock as collateral.; 1
0284.00020; LATE CONCESSIONS Following criticism by potential investors, Neumann agreed to some concessions without relinquishing majority control.; 0
0284.00021; He agreed to give We Company any profit he receives from real estate deals he has reached with the New York-based start-up.; 0

0284.00023; This mix of long-term liabilities and short-term revenue raised questions among investors about how the company would weather an economic downturn. Neumann, 40, is not the first founder of a major start-up to be forced to step down in the last few years.; 0

He said the structural changes have been ushered in due to demonetisation and faulty GST implementation along with the collapse of IL&FS which crippled the NBFC sector.; 0
0289.00003; The slowdown in the economy is structural and not cyclical.; 0
0289.00004; This structural change has been brought about by demonetisation, hasty and faulty implementation of GST and the collapse of the IL&FS, Mitra said at the annual general meeting of Bengal Chamber of Commerce & Industry here.; 0
0289.00005; He said that when the economy was coming up from the U-curve, the rising growth rate was hit by demonetisation which caused GDP growth to fall from 8.15 per cent to 7.17 per cent.; 1

0289.00007; Mitra said that he had spoken to Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) Chairman who told him that the country was not ready for its implementation on the scheduled date.

0290.00001; What provoked the foray for GI was a social media video, that broke last month, exposing the sales of what they called the special payasam offering of Ambalapuzha temple in a private bakery in Pathanamtitta district. Sabarimala Ayyappa Temple (File photo)  Hot on the heels of Palani temple's Panchamritham prasadam offering, three temple prasadam offerings in Kerala are in the race to climb the GI bandwagon.; 0

0290.00006; But then, unlike the case of Pazani panchamritam, the decision to seek patent for prasadams of three Kerala temples, was triggered by the urgency to check the proliferation of counterfeits, A Padmakumar, president, Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB).; 0

0292.00001; Problems with VAT are common, either because a business does not have the right systems in place or because of a specific complication.; 0
0292.00002; Serious cash flow crises can also arise if you fail to set aside enough funds to pay your VAT bill. You'll also need to be ready to deal with any tax enquiries from HMRC  You can avoid most problems with VAT by making sure you deal with all the paperwork correctly. That means issuing VAT invoices with the correct date or tax point, retaining them from suppliers, keeping proper VAT records, dealing with your VAT returns on time and so on.; 0
0292.00003; Problems with VAT are more likely if your VAT accounting is complicated. Retailers in particular should make sure they are using the right VAT accounting scheme. We've listed some of the most common problematic areas:  Supplies for personal (non-business) use If goods or services are bought for both business and non-business use, the input VAT may be apportioned with only the business element recovered.; 0
0292.00004; Alternatively, VAT can be recovered in full on the entire purchase of goods provided output VAT is declared on a self-supply of the non-business element.; 0
0292.00005; Generally input VAT cannot be reclaimed, unless employees have to be given domestic accommodation wholly for a business purpose and HMRC agreement is obtained. Meals at work for sole traders, partners and directors They cannot reclaim VAT on meals at work, but can claim for subsistence expenses while on business trips.; 0
0292.00006; VAT on business entertainment for third parties (eg customers and suppliers) can never be reclaimed.; 0
0292.00007; Reclaims may be allowed for VAT related to staff entertainment. The entertainment must have a discernible business purpose.; 0
0292.00008; Where the entertainment is for both employees and outsiders, it may be possible to reclaim some VAT.  VAT on supplies purchased to make exempt sales (partial exemption) Generally before you can reclaim input VAT, expenditure must be directly attributable to VATable supplies. Small amounts may be reclaimed if within certain set limits. The calculation of recoverable VAT in this instance is complex and there are anomalies such as VAT recovery rights.; 0
0292.00009; Get expert advice.; 0
0292.00010; It is not always obvious when to charge output VAT or which part of the sale to calculate it on. Output VAT must sometimes be charged as if the transaction was a notional sale or on services which are usually thought of as a zero rated or exempt.; 0
0292.00011; Output VAT is usually due on the full value. There are some exceptions such as free samples to customers, gifts costing less than £50, gifts of services and goods to charity.; 0
0292.00012; If you pay nothing, VAT is charged on the cost (normally the market cost) as if it is a sale Special rules apply to cars and fuel. Post, packaging and delivery charges to customers Although you do not pay VAT on public postal services, you must charge VAT at same rate as the goods being delivered or posted. This applies provided the contract is for 'delivered goods', even if you show a separate charge on your price list or invoice.; 0
0292.00013; If UK delivery is offered as an optional extra, VAT will be due on the charge.; 0
0292.00014; If the goods are for export, or leave from outside the UK, you should take advice.; 0
0292.00015; Beware of overpaying VAT which you will never get back by calculating VAT on the full price rather than on the discounted price.; 0
0292.00016; The VAT payable on a supply depends on how the discount is offered. If an unconditional discount (such as a trade discount) is given, the VAT is based on the discounted value of the full sale.; 0
0292.00017; The same applies for prompt payment discounts - even if the customer does not pay promptly.; 0
0292.00018; Mixed supplies may contain components liable to different VAT rates.; 0
0292.00019; You work out the total VAT liability in proportion to the value of each component. Composite supplies have one VAT liability based on the main component. Part-exchange or barter transactions VAT must be calculated as if the transaction had been entirely for cash (ie purchases and sales at the full price).; 0
0292.00020; VAT invoices must be issued accordingly.; 0
0292.00021; If you discover you have made a mistake, you must correct it.; 0
0292.00022; There is an error reporting threshold of £10,000 or 1% of your total sales (whichever is higher) up to a maximum of £50,000 and also a time limit for how far back you can go to correct any VAT mistakes.; 0
0292.00023; Provided you are within the limits, you can adjust past errors on your current VAT return.; 0
0292.00024; You will also need to correct any errors in your VAT accounts.; 0
0292.00025; Late payments from customers can cause problems with VAT. The VAT you have to pay to HMRC is normally based on when the transaction took place, not when payment was received.; 0
0292.00026; So late payments - or worse, bad debts - can cause serious VAT problems.; 0
0292.00027; If a customer defaults and you have already paid the output VAT to HMRC, you can claim bad debt relief if the invoice is more than six months overdue.; 0
0292.00028; It must be written off in a specific VAT bad debt account. Similarly, if you default you normally have to repay any VAT you've claimed but not paid.; 0
0292.00029; Avoid this situation if your turnover is less than £1.35 million by, using the cash accounting scheme for VAT can reduce such problems. Using this scheme, your VAT returns are based on the dates when payments are made and received. Problems with VAT payments can also arise if you have used the output tax (ie VAT you have charged on sales) as a source of finance and are unable to pay the VAT over when it is due.; 0
0292.00030; The risk of this kind of VAT problem can be reduced with good cash flow forecasting and control. The annual accounting scheme (where you make pay regular instalments based on your estimated VAT liability) may also help you better manage your cash flow.; 0
0292.00031; Whether or not you have any problems with VAT, you will probably face tax enquiries from time to time. These can vary from routine tax inspections to more serious tax investigations if HMRC suspects that all is not as it should be.; 0
0292.00032; You can reduce the likelihood and frequency of tax enquiries by dealing with VAT efficiently.; 0
0292.00033; Well-organised VAT records will also make the actual inspection process run more smoothly.; 0
0292.00034; If you do face any sort of VAT enquiry - whether you have problems with VAT or not - you may want to take advice. Depending on the circumstances, it may be worthwhile having your accountant present while an inspection takes place.; 0
0292.00035; Failing to submit or pay a VAT return carries a fixed surcharge of up to 15% based on how many times you default in a 12 month period.; 1
0292.00036; Other VAT penalty amounts are linked to the reason for errors and the tax potentially lost but can be reduced if you voluntarily disclose the error to HMRC:  no penalty if you take reasonable care - which includes telling HMRC if you discover a mistake up to 30% if you have been careless or failed to send in a return up to 70% if the error was deliberate up to 100% if the error was deliberate and you tried to conceal it  If you do think you are going to have a problem with paying your VAT, contact the HMRC Business Payment Support Service on 0845 302 1435 as soon as possible. Like any tax payment problems, you need to take action immediately, rather than hoping it will go away. If in doubt, contact HMRC and ask for a written ruling.; 0

0295.00005; Can Taxing the Wealthy Fix the Economy? Image  CreditKotryna Zukauskaite  Taxing the rich is having a moment in American politics, even more than usual. For decades, Democrats and Republicans in Washington have battled over how much money the highest-earning Americans should send to the federal government each year  -  a fight that has mostly played out between a few percentage points of the top marginal rate of income taxes.; 0

0295.00007; It was the political equivalent of watching two football teams push the ball back and forth between the 40 yard lines. As the 2020 election approaches, a new crop of Democratic candidates has opened a much larger field of play on the issue, cheered by voters who tell pollsters the economy is stacked against the working class and in favor of the rich.; 0
0295.00008; Those candidates are looking beyond the income tax  -  which many of them would increase for the rich, to be clear  -  and offering plans to tax wealth, investments and a variety of other hallmarks of the economic top 1 percent.; 0

0295.00011; The flurry of proposals are entwined with questions of economic fairness, mobility and efficiency. JIM TANKERSLEY  CLOSE INHERITANCE LOOPHOLES The government should eliminate the so-called step-up in basis for assets that are passed on at death, which allows wealthy heirs to avoid taxes. INCREASE TAX COMPLIANCE More funding should be allocated for tax enforcement to increase compliance and raise more tax revenue.; 0

0295.00013; Some members of the panel, including James Pethokoukis, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, viewed the proposal of a wealth tax as simply punitive, arguing that it targeted the wealthy without accomplishing larger aims like fairness or social mobility. Other members, including Gene Sperling, a former economic adviser to Presidents Obama and Clinton, argued that this is an important moment in which the concept of fairness and economic dignity has become central to the larger debate around tax reform.; 0

0295.00017; Image  CreditKotryna Zukauskaite  Cannabis legalization in the United States and Canada was promoted as a radical social experiment that would tame the illegal trade and usher in a new era of responsible drug use.; 0
0295.00018; However, the results have been mixed. Hundreds of illegal dispensaries in California continue to proliferate, and the state's governor, Gavin Newsom, recently ordered National Guard troops near the Mexican border to go after black market cannabis farms. And pot regulations have been unevenly applied.; 0
0295.00019; While major cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco host cannabis retailers, 80 percent of California's nearly 500 municipalities do not. In Canada, it has been nearly a year since the country became the first major world economy to legalize recreational cannabis  -  a seminal moment akin to ending Prohibition in the United States.; 0
0295.00020; Yet a black market that has previously been estimated at 5.3 billion Canadian dollars continues to thrive, and legal sales are far below what proponents of legalization had hoped for. Six months after Canada legalized pot for recreational use, more than 40 percent of Canadian cannabis users said they bought it from illegal sources, according to a recent report from Canada's national statistics office.; 0
0295.00021; Proponents of legalization argue that it is far too early to pass judgment it took several years for legal sales in Colorado to surpass 70 percent, for example.; 0
0295.00022; DAN BILEFSKY  BETTER EDUCATION ABOUT RISKS Amid the notion that legalization has not been met by adequate education about risks of use, the industry should be required to fund a campaign to educate people on the risks of cannabis, but not be involved in writing the literature.; 0
0295.00023; Education should have a strong focus on youth to try and delay the onset of teen use.; 0
0295.00024; CONNECT BANKS WITH LEGAL DISTRIBUTORS Pass the Safe Banking Act, which would destigmatize financial relations between banks and businesses that might have an ancillary relationship with cannabis companies.; 0
0295.00025; Normalizing banking industry relations with cannabis companies, growers and retailers will help bring businesses out of the illicit market.; 0
0295.00026; Some members of the panel did not agree that cannabis should be legal, given its illegality at the federal level.; 0
0295.00027; While most people agreed with the necessity of some amnesty, as the criminal justice system disproportionately affects people from marginalized communities, there was little agreement on what decriminalization should look like. What Will End the Student Debt Crisis? Image  CreditKotryna Zukauskaite  Americans owe nearly $1.6 trillion on student loans.; 0
0295.00028; The debt has tripled in less than 15 years and eclipsed the amount due on credit cards, auto loans and all consumer debts outside of mortgages.; 0
0295.00029; For a generation of students  -  and, in many families, their parents  -  the cost of college has become a crisis.; 0
0295.00030; One in four adult Americans has student loan debt the typical borrower owes more than $20,000.; 0
0295.00031; The federal government is the primary lender for those who borrow for college, and the Education Department has effectively become one of the nation's biggest banks. It directly holds more than $1.2 trillion in loans owed by 34 million people.; 1
0295.00032; There are signs that the burden is weighing on the broader economy.; 0
0295.00033; Homeownership rates among those under 32 dropped significantly over the last decade, which is partly attributable to their student loan debts, Federal Reserve researchers said in a recent report. The increase in debt has also hindered small business formation, reduced young adults' retirement savings and contributed to lower marriage rates, economists have found.; 0
0295.00034; The issue has become a signature policy point for some 2020 presidential hopefuls.; 0
0295.00035; STACY COWLEY  EXPAND TARGETED DEBT RELIEF Most panelists agreed that some portion of the $1.6 trillion owed on student loans needed to be written off.; 0
0295.00036; The government's current income-based repayment plans on federal student loans (which can culminate in debt forgiveness) should be improved and may also need to be paired with outright debt elimination for some borrowers.; 0
0295.00037; EXPAND FREE PUBLIC EDUCATION ASK MORE OF STATES AND BUSINESSES Students are guaranteed a free education from kindergarten through high school, but that education is no longer sufficient for many jobs.; 0
0295.00038; Offering free higher education  -  as more than a dozen states have done, to varying degrees  -  can keep students out of debt and improve the nation's work force.; 0
0295.00039; But successful outcomes require a sustained and nuanced commitment from states and, ideally, from employers, too.; 0
0295.00040; The panel broadly agreed that student lending should be restructured to make the amount students repay for higher education more contingent on their post-college income.; 0
0295.00041; But there was strong disagreement about whether the approach should focus on improved income-based repayment options or should shift to income-share agreements, in which students agree to pay a portion of their future income to a financier in exchange for an education.; 0

0295.00045; Can Pricing Carbon Stall Climate Change? Image  CreditKotryna Zukauskaite  Earlier this month, the 10 top-polling Democratic primary candidates took part in a CNN town hall event on climate change, the first prime-time televised forum devoted to the issue in a presidential campaign. In perhaps the most significant development of that night, nine of the 10 candidates openly embraced the idea of putting a tax or fee on carbon dioxide pollution.; 0
0295.00046; While most economists agree it is the best way to cut emissions, it has drawn intense political opposition, such as from the so-called yellow-vest protesters in France last winter, when protests shut down the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower. And this year, even as the issue of climate change gained political prominence, progressive lawmakers did not include a carbon tax or price in the Green New Deal. Still, recent scientific reports, which have concluded that the impacts of climate change  -  stronger storms, droughts, heat waves, rising sea levels and flooding  -  are already being felt, have also called more explicitly on governments to respond by pricing carbon.; 0
0295.00047; Polls have shown that rising numbers of Democratic primary, millennial and independent voters see climate change as an increasingly important issue. But the political path for the promise of turning that pledge into legislation remains steep and tricky. CORAL DAVENPORT  NET ZERO EMISSIONS Although the panel could not reach consensus on how exactly we would get here, they agreed the federal government needs to place a limit on greenhouse gases with the goal of net zero emissions by no later than 2050, combined with carbon pricing.; 0
0295.00048; REDIRECT FUNDS IN POSITIVE WAYS A portion of the revenue from carbon pricing should go toward underserved and low-income communities, supporting them in a just and equitable transition away from fossil fuels. Members of the panel were divided on whether trading a carbon tax in exchange for stripping away regulations would be the most effective way to lower emissions.; 0
0295.00049; While most members of the panel agreed with the necessity of a price on carbon in general, there was little agreement on how to make a price on carbon palatable to Republicans and businesses, or even whether appealing to them is an important element to consider.

0295.00051; With concerns over online privacy increasing, United States regulators and lawmakers are scrambling to create laws and regulations to protect internet users.; 0
0295.00052; The result so far has amounted to a fractured and often dizzying regulatory landscape for businesses trying to navigate the limits of their ability to collect, share and protect user data. It has been a striking turn of events for Silicon Valley, which Democrats and Republicans had for years sought to bolster by limiting laws that could curb the growth of America's brightest engine of economic growth.; 0
0295.00053; But with Europe's implementation last year of a privacy law known as the General Data Protection Regulation and issues like Facebook's mishandling of data harvested by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, the question for lawmakers is not whether to regulate, but how forcefully.; 0

0295.00055; There are even state and federal proposals to put a price on the value of personal data, and internet companies would have to pay users in order to profit from their information.

0299.00001; An exemption-free tax rate of 22%  -  25.17% including cesses and surcharge  -  sounds attractive, but an analysis of the tax liability of firms listed in Sensex suggests more than half have reason to stick to the existing tax regime.; 0
0299.00002; Budget data shows the average effective tax rate (ETR)  -  taxes as a percentage of pretax profits  -  for roughly 8.4 lakh firms that filed returns for 2017-18 was just over 29%. A TOI analysis of the 21 non-financial firms in the Sensex shows only 10 faced an ETR of over 25% in 2018-19.; 0
0299.00003; The remaining 11 had an ETR below the 25.17% that they would have to shell out if they migrated to the new regime.; 1
0299.00004; Banks and financial sector firms were excluded from the analysis because their taxes are calculated somewhat differently (mainly because of provisioning) and including them might have distorted the overall picture.; 0
0299.00005; After excluding the nine financial sector firms in the sensex, the overall average ETR worked out to 22.9% in 2018-19.; 1
0299.00006; But individual ETRs vary widely  -  from Sun Pharma with a negative tax burden of 13.5%, to Tata Steel, which paid 35% of its pre-tax profits as tax. The actual tax paid can, however, include refunds for extra tax paid in earlier years or additional liability for deferred taxes (ETR1 in the accompanying graphic).; 0
0299.00007; We therefore looked also at the current tax as a percentage of the profit before taxes (ETR2 in the graphic).; 0
0299.00008; By this measure, the average for these 21 firms was 25.7%, close to what the new regime would offer. Again, about half the firms might not have a compelling reason to make the shift.; 0
0299.00009; Even firms just over the 25% mark in this chart might think twice since once exemptions are given up they cannot be availed of in future.; 1
0299.00010; Having said that, a number of corporate tax specialists TOI spoke to said most large companies would transition to the new regime because over the last several years, exemptions have been whittled down.; 0
0299.00011; Notably, almost all IT firms are below the 25% ETR level  -  clearly because of tax incentives given to the sector  -  as is Reliance Industries, the company paying the highest taxes on this list but with an ETR of barely 20% if one looks at the current tax liability.; 1

0301.00003; Ryan Kenny  13 September 2019  Last week National Savings and Investments (NS&I) withdrew its one and three-year Guaranteed Growth and Income bonds from sale with immediate effect. It also cut rates for both new customers and some savers rolling over. It'll cost savers nearly £60m in lost interest.; 1

Next year's is roughly £11bn but if the products on offer are too popular, it could end up raising more than this. The cuts come alongside other changes too.; 0
0301.00006; In May this year, NS&I changed the inflation measure used to calculate returns on their index-linked savings certificates from the Retail Price Index to the usually lower Consumer Price Index.

A project with 'absolutely everything' McDonald started as a property manager for the authority in 1999 after graduating from High Point University in North Carolina with a political science degree.; 0
0303.00020; She became director in 2008, eventually earning $115,000 a year.; 1
0303.00021; Chatty and self-assured, she excelled at navigating both complex land transactions and the clubby local political landscape.; 0
0303.00022; She presided over the powerful Rotary Club, cheekily wore a Dallas Cowboys jersey on football Sundays in a community of die-hard Washington Redskins fans and boasted (falsely, it turned out) about winning $102,000 at the slot machines in nearby Charles Town, W.Va. As director, she helped lure Walmart, Target and a Lowe's home improvement store to Front Royal, as well as a $100 million hospital that is under construction, a former board member said.; 0
0303.00023; In 2014, she met Tran, who had sought help with the data center idea from the office of then-Rep.; 0
0303.00024; Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), according to Pete Larkin, who was Goodlatte 's chief of staff. A soft-spoken resident of upscale Great Falls, Va., whose website boasts of contracts with the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, Tran wanted to turn part of the former Avtex Fibers manufacturing campus into a hub for cloud computing, with a three-building, $40 million complex that according to its business plan would include a restaurant, a coffee shop and a music store.; 0
0303.00025; McDonald's board approved a $10 million, 90-day loan.; 0
0303.00026; Tran promised funding from 80 foreign investors enrolled in the federal EB-5 visa program, which offers applicants and their families a path to citizenship in exchange for the jobs their money helps create.; 0
0303.00027; Officials and residents gushed over the plan. This is our first step into a new era, then-Mayor Timothy Darr said at a 2015 groundbreaking, as McDonald, Tran and Goodlatte smiled nearby.; 0
0303.00028; The regional Criminal Justice Training Academy was announced the following year. McDonald said an anonymous donor would provide $8 million, and told her board the donor was Tran, the civil lawsuit says.; 0
0303.00029; McEathron, a fellow Rotarian, would be in charge.; 0
0303.00030; The broad-shouldered sheriff was a morning fixture at a vinyl-booth diner on Main Street.; 0
0303.00031; He had launched a summer camp and amused his deputies by playing faux saxophone as they lip synced to Love Shack by the B-52's.; 0
0303.00032; The training academy further raised his profile. This is the first time we've ever done anything like this, McDonald said, according to an account in the Northern Virginia Daily.; 0
0303.00033; McEathron boasted: We can offer absolutely everything at this facility. It all seemed incredibly fortunate. Until late 2016, when some town officials and residents looked up Tran's company online.; 0
0303.00034; They found it hadn't yet been allowed to solicit investments under the EB-5 program. The $140 million federal contract appeared to be a mirage, with Tran receiving no payments from it.; 1
0303.00035; Skeptics asked increasingly pointed questions at public meetings, sparking warnings from Town Council members that the naysayers would blow Front Royal's big chance. They chewed me up and down, said Bébhinn Egger, a former council member who was among the first to raise alarms.; 0
0303.00036; It only took me about 15 minutes of research to see that there was something fishy going on.; 0
0303.00037; In an email to McDonald in early 2017, Tran said the questions meant our ability to raise capital within the EB-5 investor community is now in jeopardy, court records filed as part of the civil lawsuit show.; 0
0303.00038; His company was eventually approved for the program, then later disqualified, a decision Tran is appealing, according to U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services, which administers the EB-5 program.; 0
0303.00039; The Town Council authorized $1.7 million of infrastructure improvements for the Avtex site, and according to the lawsuit, McDonald allegedly paid Tran at least $1.5 million for construction costs without informing her board.; 0
0303.00040; In 2018, Front Royal's finance director discovered a bigger red flag: The authority had overbilled Front Royal nearly $300,000 for its portion of debt service related to the Avtex site and a road improvement project.; 1
0303.00041; At a meeting about the discrepancy, McDonald nonchalantly said she had mistakenly falsified some invoices, Town Attorney Doug Napier recalled. She was not at all contrite, Napier said.; 0
0303.00042; It just shocked me.; 0
0303.00043; The revelation prompted a call to state police and an independent review of the authority's books that uncovered a dizzying array of phony invoices, phantom projects, secret land deals and bank wire transfers to entities controlled by McDonald or her friends, according to a copy of the review completed in May by the Cherry Bekaert accounting firm.; 0
0303.00044; The probe was commissioned by the authority and is the basis of the criminal and civil proceedings.; 0
0303.00045; McDonald allegedly billed the authority more than $50,000 to pay for renovating a vacant inn, then used those funds to pay credit card bills, according to the review. She is accused of doctoring invoices to secure $4.6 million for purchasing tax credits, then embezzling that money.; 0
0303.00046; A plumbing company owned by her husband, Sammy North, allegedly collected at least $66,200 in secret payments, the review found.; 0
0303.00047; North has also been arrested, as was Donald F. Poe, a family friend accused of conspiring with McDonald to funnel $841,409 to his solar panel installation company for work the board didn't authorize. North did not return messages seeking comment.; 0
0303.00048; Ryan Huttar, an attorney for Poe's company, said that his client performed the work it was hired to do and that it reimbursed the authority $335,000 when one job was canceled.; 1
0303.00049; Attorneys in the civil lawsuit say McDonald allegedly convinced the authority to buy land from her aunt and uncle for a workforce housing project without disclosing that they were her relatives, and billed the authority an additional $130,000 in the transaction, most of which went to pay off what appeared to be her mortgage.; 1
0303.00050; You'd think somebody, somewhere along the line, would have an inkling that something was amiss earlier on, said Napier, who filed a lawsuit on behalf of Front Royal seeking $15 million in damages from the authority and Warren County. This community is sort of like Mayberry, Napier said.; 0
0303.00051; We're not used to criminality in government here.; 0
0303.00052; Allegations, arrests, tragedy McEathron wasn't charged. But he may have felt the tide turning against him. He and McDonald had launched a real estate investment company called DaBoyz LLC in 2016, shortly after they announced the police academy.; 0
0303.00053; The firm used $3.5 million in authority funds to buy four properties, the independent review found.; 1
0303.00054; McDonald and McEathron also bought a three-bedroom home in Virginia Beach, which they rented to McEathron's son and daughter-in-law, court records in the civil lawsuit show.; 0
0303.00055; In one curious transaction, which lawyers for the authority say may have been an attempt to launder money, DaBoyz paid Rappawan, a construction company, $1.9 million for a large tract of land and then sold it back a month later for $1.3 million. declined to comment, citing the criminal investigations. In March, the authority filed its own lawsuit, against McDonald, McEathron, Tran, their companies and two contractors.; 0
0303.00056; The following month, the FBI raided the authority's offices, seizing documents in what signified the launch of a U.S. Justice Department investigation, according to local news reports at the time. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office for the Western District of Virginia declined to discuss the probe, which Warren County officials confirmed was underway.; 0
0303.00057; The sheriff was despondent over his tarnished image, his attorney said.; 0
0303.00058; He took early retirement in May. A few weeks later, he testified before a local grand jury, appearing at the county courthouse with his wife, a member of the county School Board.; 0
0303.00059; Then, just before Memorial Day weekend, McDonald was arrested. The following Tuesday, McEathron killed himself outside his family's secluded mountainside home.; 0
0303.00060; Some of his deputies found his body. The gun was nearby.; 0
0303.00061; Either knowingly or unknowingly, he allowed himself to become involved in some of the things that apparently happened, said Ron Llewellyn, a former county supervisor who was a friend of McEathron's and served on the authority's board when McDonald was director.; 0
0303.00062; Llewellyn was among those indicted this week. He denies wrongdoing and said the allegations against the sheriff go against his memories of a man he saw as a pleasant, by-the-book law enforcement official.; 0
0303.00063; But, he added, the evidence against McEathron is damning.; 0
0303.00064; I just can't believe that he wasn't aware of some of it, Llewellyn said.; 0
0303.00065; 'Tip of the iceberg' McDonald was charged this summer with additional counts of money laundering and grand larceny.; 0
0303.00066; Her husband was arrested on counts of money laundering and obtaining money by false pretenses. The local grand jury, which was initially set to finish its work this month, requested another six months to investigate. While out of jail on $75,000 bond, McDonald lost a different court battle, with a judge in a defamation lawsuit ruling that she staged burglaries at her office and home in 2017 to try to deflect suspicions against her.; 0
0303.00067; The judge awarded County Supervisor Thomas H. Sayre (R-Shenandoah) $20,000 in damages for being implicated in those phony crimes.; 1
0303.00068; Tuesday's announcement included charges against Sayre, who denied wrongdoing through his attorney. Several others denied wrongdoing as well, or declined to comment.; 0
0303.00069; Tran's company has put a small, one-story office building on the Avtex site and is working to repay the $10 million loan from the authority.; 0
0303.00070; Tran was able to extend the term to 2045, officials said.; 0
0303.00071; Because of one of the lawsuits, Tran is forbidden to sell the property, valued at $2.2 million.; 1
0303.00072; Court levies have also been placed on seven properties McDonald owns, plus six cars and $82,500 she has in the bank. In hopes of regaining financial stability, the authority is trying to sell several of its properties, including a building on Main Street that Jeff and Ginny Leser leased in 2018 to open a general store.; 0
0303.00073; The couple hadn't known about the brewing scandal. Or that the same building previously housed a store McDonald, her friend William Lambert and her former aide Michelle Henry allegedly used as a vehicle to steal more agency money.; 0
0303.00074; Henry has been charged with embezzlement Lambert with money laundering and obtaining money by false pretense.; 0
0303.00075; Lambert's attorney, Phillip Griffin, said he has entered a plea of not guilty, adding that his client is a minor player in the scandal.; 0
0303.00076; Henry did not return phone messages neither did Ryan Nuzzo , the attorney who represented her at her bond hearing.; 0
0303.00077; The Lesers spent $9,000 to fix a bathroom the authority refused to repair.; 1
0303.00078; Last month, they closed their store, frustrated by sluggish sales, a warped ceiling and leaky roof, and the possibility that the building could be sold out from under them. I try not to feel like a failure, Ginny Leser said in an interview. But I do feel foolish.; 0
0303.00079; Local activists, who had called for the state and federal investigations to be expanded, rejoiced at Tuesday's announcement. Somebody is finally listening, said Salins, co-founder of the Warren County Coalition watchdog group.; 0
0303.00080; It's not every day that your entire government gets arrested. It's so shameful.; 0
0303.00081; Residents had been pointing to emails between McDonald and other officials  -  some of which surfaced in the independent review, and some of which were printed out and dropped anonymously in mailboxes  -  that appear to demonstrate the government was aware of some suspicious transactions.; 0
0303.00082; And they had been demanding answers from Supervisor Tony Carter (R-Happy Creek), another of the people charged in the recent indictments.; 0
0303.00083; Carter works for his mother's insurance company, Stoneburner-Carter, which holds insurance policies on four properties owned by the authority and has collected about $46,000 in premiums since 2015, according to records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.; 0
0303.00084; He didn't return calls Tuesday, but said earlier that the insurance contract does not pose a conflict because he doesn't own the company and, therefore, doesn't directly benefit from the payments.; 0
0303.00085; If I did have ownership, that would have precluded me from writing those policies, he said.; 0
0303.00086; I did what was legally correct.; 0
0303.00087; Kristie Atwood, whose Facebook page One Mad Mother has become a repository of news about the investigations, called the latest indictments just the tip of the iceberg.; 0

Photograph: Larry W Smith/EPA  Donald Trump pretends to be a tribune of the working class, standing up for American jobs.; 0
0304.00003; Last week nearly 50,000 General Motors workers went on strike to get what they see as their fair share of its profits and stop further layoffs.; 1
0304.00004; Trump's response? A shrug.; 0
0304.00005; 'It's devastating'.; 0
0304.00006; End of GM in Ohio town as Trump fails to bring back midwest jobs Read more  In 2009, when GM was on the brink of collapse, the United Auto Workers (UAW) agreed to let the company hire new workers at about half the prevailing hourly wage and with skimpier retirement benefits, hire temp workers at even lower rates, and outsource more jobs abroad.; 0
0304.00007; American taxpayers also forked over $10bn to save the company.; 1
0304.00008; When GM went public again in 2010, it boasted to Wall Street that 43% of its cars were made outside the US in places where labor cost less than $15 an hour, while in America it could now pay lower-tiered wages and benefits for new employees. The corporation came roaring back. Over the last three years it's made $35bn in North America.; 0
0304.00009; But its workers are still getting measly pay packages and GM is still outsourcing like mad. Last year it assigned its new Chevrolet Blazer, a sport utility vehicle that had been made in the US, to a Mexican plant, while announcing it would lay off 18,000 American workers.; 0
0304.00010; Earlier this year it shut its giant plant in Lordstown, Ohio, which Trump had vowed to save.; 0

0304.00013; Some of this largesse has gone into the pockets of executives.; 0

0304.00016; He's sad to see it and hopes it will be short, adding: I don't want General Motors to be building plants outside of this country.; 0
0304.00017; Reminds me of last month's anodyne statement from the Business Roundtable  -  a confab of CEOs on whose executive committee Barra sits  -  pledging to compensate all employees fairly and provide them important benefits. For 40 years these CEOs have fought unions, outsourced jobs abroad, loaded up on labor-replacing technologies without retraining their workers, and abandoned their communities when they could do things more cheaply elsewhere.; 0
0304.00018; Does anyone really think they've changed their minds?; 0
0304.00019; Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos signed the statement. Last week, Amazon-owned Whole Foods announced it would be cutting medical benefits for its entire part-time workforce  -  at a total saving of what Bezos makes in two hours.; 0
0304.00020; Corporate profits have reached record levels but most Americans have not benefited. Profits now constitute a larger portion of national income, and wages a lower portion, than at any time since the second world war.; 0
0304.00021; These profits are generating higher share prices (fueled by share buybacks) and higher executive pay, resulting in wider inequality. The richest 1% of Americans own about 40% of all shares of stock the richest 10%, around 80%.; 1
0304.00022; The demise of unions explains much of this.; 0
0304.00023; In the mid-1950s, more than a third of all workers in the private sector were unionized.; 0
0304.00024; This gave them substantial bargaining power to get higher wages and benefits. Non-unionized workers benefited indirectly because their employers knew they'd be unionized if they didn't nearly match the union contracts.; 0
0304.00025; 'A kick in the stomach': massive GM layoffs leave workers distraught  -  and angry Read more  Today, just 6.4% of private-sector workers are unionized, eliminating most of that bargaining power.; 0
0304.00026; Researchers Daniel Greenwald at MIT's Sloan School of Business, Martin Lettau at Berkeley and Sydney Ludvigson at NYU have found that between 1952 and 1988, almost all the rise in share values came as a result of economic growth, but that from 1989 to 2017, economic growth accounted for just 24% of the rise. Most of the increase in share values has come from reallocated rents to shareholders and away from labor compensation.; 1
0304.00027; Translated: from corporate revenues that otherwise would go to workers.; 0
0304.00028; America's shift from farm to factory was accompanied by decades of bloody labor conflict.; 0
0304.00029; The subsequent shift from factory to office and other service jobs created further social upheaval. The more recent power shift from workers to shareholders  -  and consequentially, the dramatic widening of inequality  -  has happened far more quietly, but it has had a more unfortunate and more lasting consequence for the system: stagnant wages, abandoned communities, and an angry working class vulnerable to demagogues peddling authoritarianism, racism, and xenophobia. Trump didn't come from nowhere, but he's a fake champion of the working class.; 0

0315.00021; Those are important steps in the right direction, but we must do more. The governor and legislative leaders are currently negotiating a new tax incentive program.; 0
0315.00022; That program must require warehouse developers and operators seeking tax incentives to provide permanent, full-time jobs with fair wages, affordable healthcare, safe working conditions, and respect for workers' right to organize. Additionally, these companies should be subject to increased oversight and enforcement policies that hold them accountable to their commitments.; 0
0315.00023; If large corporations tell us that tax breaks will help our communities by driving economic development to our state, they should be required to create jobs that provide pathways out of poverty. Warehouse work could be an important ladder into the middle class for tens of thousands of New Jerseyans. We must not let corporate greed and political corruption get in the way.; 0
0315.00024; It's time to ensure that subsidies for warehouse operators create jobs that empower thousands of New Jersey residents who work in this rapidly growing sector. Only responsible companies who respect their workers and provide good jobs should receive tax incentives. Anything less is unacceptable.; 0

0324.00002; A LABOUR senator has questioned the need for massive social welfare payments to many families after revealing yesterday that some are receiving €90,000 a year.; 0
0324.00003; Senator Jimmy Harte highlighted the case of one family who are being paid €1,763 per week. The unemployed married couple, who have four children and live in Dublin, claim a range of social welfare benefits.; 1
0324.00004; Mr Harte, who received the information from Department of Social Protection officials, said €50,000 is more than enough for a family to survive on.; 0
0324.00005; The Donegal-based senator told the Irish Independent yesterday that he believed the figure was far too much to be handed to a family in support payments. The family are doing nothing illegal but the system is wrong when a couple are able to receive €90,000 per year for doing nothing.; 0
0324.00006; I don't think this sort of payment is acceptable in the good times, never mind the bad times we find ourselves in now. There are married couples in this country with two good jobs, working very hard and are not receiving anything like this.; 0
0324.00007; As well as receiving €90,000, they will not have to pay property tax or water charges.; 0
0324.00008; That is just wrong. You would need to be earning close to €140,000 to take that sort of money home after tax.; 0
0324.00009; This is a Dublin-based family but I know there are families in other counties receiving up to €85,000. They won't take in as much in rent allowance but they are still entitled to all the other payments, he said.; 0
0324.00010; According to figures obtained by Mr Harte, the following is the weekly breakdown of the social welfare payments received by the family: father on disability allowance, €322 guardian's pension for child taken in, €286 rent supplement, €276 mother -- carer's allowance, €380 child benefit, €288 daughter (17) with special needs, €211. Mr Harte said he has forwarded all this information on to the Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton and wants a cap put on welfare payments. Editor's Choice Also in Irish News; 0

0326.00001; Book Bits | 14 September 2019 ● The Case For People's Quantitative Easing  By Frances Coppola  Review via Brave New Europe  The thesis behind the book is that, although quantitative easing since the Great Financial Crisis of 2007/8 has failed, the cause of failure was its implementation, not the policy itself.; 0
0326.00002; Quantitative easing was a policy proposed by Milton Friedman and Ann Schwartz back in 1963 as a way to counter a financial depression, or Great Contraction as they termed it. The idea was to radically increase the money supply, providing consumers with money to resuscitate the economy.; 0
0326.00003; Five years later Friedman used the metaphor of a helicopter dropping money over communities to achieve this goal. He emphasised that it had to be a one-off event to discourage people from saving it, thinking there was more to come.; 0
0326.00004; Following the Great Financial Crisis, central banks worldwide initiated Friedman's policy of helicopter money, dispensing trillions of dollars.; 1
0326.00005; However, as Coppola explains, this massive use of quantitative easing, or the Great Experiment, failed because Friedman's 'helicopter drop came to mean not putting money into people's pockets, but rather casting money blindly onto international financial markets without regard to where it would end up. The desired result did not happen instead we find ourselves in the Long Stagnation.; 0
0326.00006; ● Tools and Weapons: The Promise and the Peril of the Digital Age  By Brad Smith and Carol Ann Browne  Review via Politico  Brad Smith joined Microsoft as a 34-year-old attorney in 1993, at a time when the company's market value was about $25 billion.; 0
0326.00007; Today, the company has a market value of more than a trillion dollars, and Smith, at age 60, is its president.; 0
0326.00008; He is also the author of a new book about technology in the modern world filled with arguments that he says would have surprised and elicited disapproval from a younger version of himself.; 0
0326.00009; The more startling change, however, is the evolution of not his own views but other people's. I think the most stunning surprise about the state of the world at the moment, Smith said in an interview with POLITICO, is to see such a profound lack of optimism in the future, by so many people, in a time of great prosperity. ● Schism: China, America, and the Fracturing of the Global Trading System  By Paul Blustein  Summary via publisher (CIGI Press)  History was heralded when China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, for good reason: the world's most populous nation was entering the rules-based system that has governed international commerce since World War II.; 0
0326.00010; But the full ramifications of that event are only now becoming apparent, as the Chinese economic juggernaut evolved in unanticipated and profoundly troublesome ways.; 0
0326.00011; In this book, journalist Paul Blustein chronicles the contentious process resulting in China's WTO membership and the transformative changes that followed, both good and bad  -  for China, for its trading partners, and for the global trading system as a whole.; 0
0326.00012; ● Transaction Man: The Rise of the Deal and the Decline of the American Dream  By Nicholas Lemann  Review via Publishers Weekly  New Yorker staff writer Lemann (The Promised Land) describes the evolution of American corporate culture in this excellent and unusually framed economic history.; 0
0326.00013; Lemann describes how the American worker once dedicated his or her life to a single company, receiving generous benefits, career-long job security, and a pension, whereas the transaction man labors at the mercy of corporate shareholders who may sell, break up, or merge a company to maximize share price. Lemann attributes this change to the work of economists Milton Friedman, who believed the sole function of corporations was to maximize profits for shareholders, and Michael Jensen, who justified rapacious junk bond trading, hostile takeovers, and debt-leveraged buyouts.; 0
0326.00014; ● Moving Up without Losing Your Way: The Ethical Costs of Upward Mobility  By Jennifer M. Morton  Summary via publisher (Princeton University Press)  Upward mobility through the path of higher education has been an article of faith for generations of working-class, low-income, and immigrant college students.; 0
0326.00015; While we know this path usually entails financial sacrifices and hard work, very little attention has been paid to the deep personal compromises such students have to make as they enter worlds vastly different from their own. Measuring the true cost of higher education for those from disadvantaged backgrounds, Moving Up without Losing Your Way looks at the ethical dilemmas of upward mobility - the broken ties with family and friends, the severed connections with former communities, and the loss of identity - faced by students as they strive to earn a successful place in society.; 0
0326.00016; ● Possessed: Why We Want More Than We Need  By Bruce Hood  Summary via publisher (Oxford University Press)  You may not believe it, but there is a link between our current political instability and your childhood attachment to teddy bears.; 0
0326.00017; There's also a reason why children in Asia are more likely to share than their western counterparts and why the poor spend more of their income on luxury goods than the rich.; 0
0326.00018; Or why your mother is more likely to leave her money to you than your father.; 0
0326.00019; What connects these things? The answer is our need for ownership. Award-winning psychologist Bruce Hood draws on research from his own lab and others around the world to explain why this uniquely human preoccupation governs our behaviour from the cradle to the grave, even when it is often irrational, and destructive.; 0

0327.00001; (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk urged investors to approve the 2016 purchase of SolarCity at a big premium to its market value despite knowing the solar installer faced a cash crunch and publicly stating he had recused himself from involvement in the deal, according to court documents unsealed on Monday.; 0
0327.00002; FILE PHOTO: SolarCity trucks are shown in San Diego, California, U.S., November 2, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo  The filing was part of a lawsuit by Tesla shareholders alleging the company's board breached its duties to investors by approving the $2.6 billion acquisition of the struggling company, which was run by Musk's first cousins and of which he was a chairman and the largest stakeholder. The former SolarCity operations have been a drag on Tesla, with panel installations slumping since they were acquired.; 0
0327.00003; Defendants asked the Delaware Court of Chancery judge to dismiss the case before it heads to a trial in March.; 0
0327.00004; Shareholder lawsuits that survive a motion to dismiss often settle before trial, which in this case might involve a payment to shareholders by Musk as well as money from directors' insurance. Tesla did not immediate respond to a request for comment on the allegations revealed in the documents.; 0
0327.00005; The suit represents another legal headache for Musk, the high-profile entrepreneur who settled a lawsuit by U.S. securities regulators last year over his use of Twitter and is being sued by for defamation by a British diver who said Musk falsely branded him a pedophile.; 0
0327.00006; Just last week, a Delaware judge ruled that Tesla must defend at trial Musk's multibillion-dollar pay package.; 0
0327.00007; According to the filing, Musk was informed at a SolarCity board meeting in October 2015 that SolarCity needed to raise up to $300 million and was slashing its solar installation forecast for the year.; 0
0327.00008; The company issued $113 million in convertible notes a month later, of which Musk bought $10 million. By February 2016, SolarCity management told the board its cash balances were forecast to drop below amounts required for a key line of credit for several months of the year. A default on that line of credit would trigger defaults on other debt instruments, the filing said.; 0
0327.00009; Despite the bad news, Musk proposed the acquisition of SolarCity to the Tesla board later that month after a Lake Tahoe family vacation with his cousin, SolarCity Chief Executive and founder Lyndon Rive. SolarCity did not disclose the details of its liquidity concerns to investors. At a meeting of Tesla's board on June 20, 2016, Musk advocated to fellow board members an initial acquisition price of $28.50 per share for SolarCity - a 30% premium to its market price - even though Tesla's financial adviser, Evercore, had recommended $25 to $27 a share.; 0
0327.00010; The board ultimately approved an exchange ratio that represented a share price of $26.50 to $28.50 a share, though the offer was lowered later prior to the deal closing. Once Tesla made the offer for SolarCity on June 21, Musk publicly recused himself from the deal.; 0
0327.00011; But according to the filings he held frequent meetings with Evercore and pushed investors in a series of phone calls to support the purchase.; 0
0327.00012; I could not be recused from all discussions ...; 0
0327.00013; I needed to voice my opinion, obviously, Musk said during questioning under oath by lawyers for the suing shareholders.; 0
0327.00014; In the meantime, Musk assured Rive that he would have [him] covered with respect to cash needs until the acquisition closed as SolarCity was running crazy close to its liquidity covenants, the documents said. The companies said SolarCity accepted the offer on Aug. 1, 2016.; 0
0327.00015; The stock swap offer valued SolarCity at $25.37 a share, less than the initial proposal, and in line with the Evercore proposal.; 0
0327.00016; Shareholders approved the deal on Nov. 17.; 0
0327.00017; At the time, Musk called the merger a no brainer that would create a renewable energy powerhouse, but many on Wall Street have billed it as a bailout of an affiliated firm. Tesla has since gutted its solar sales force and faced an 85% drop in installations.; 0

0328.00001; LONDON (Reuters)  -  Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (0388.HK) is embarking on a three-week charm offensive with London Stock Exchange (LSE.L) investors as the Asian trading house tries to salvage its proposed $39 billion takeover offer. FILE PHOTO: The name of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited is displayed at the entrance in Hong Kong, China January 24, 2018. REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo  LSE's board is refusing to engage with HKEX after emphatically rejecting its approach on Friday.; 0
0328.00002; The LSE described HKEX's offer as fundamentally flawed, saying it would not meet its strategic objectives and came with a high risk of being blocked by regulators. LSE has said it wants to stick with its plan of buying data and trading company Refinitiv for $27 billion.; 1
0328.00003; But HKEX has vowed to press on, and has set up meetings with a series of LSE's top investors over the next few weeks, according to two people familiar with the matter, raising the chances that it could make a hostile offer.; 0
0328.00004; One top-25 investor told Reuters they had a meeting booked with HKEX later this month and that there could be a hostile approach. Others said they were keen to hear more rather than dismissing the deal immediately in favor of the Refinitiv tie-up.; 0
0328.00005; We would expect there to be some synergy (in the HKEX deal) both in terms of corporate overheads and technology, said James Bevan, chief investment officer at CCLA. He added that while he was broadly supportive of the Refinitiv deal, he had some concerns about the data firm's growth strategy.; 0
0328.00006; HKEX has until Oct. 9 to make a firm offer or walk away.; 0
0328.00007; HKEX declined to comment on the deal beyond its statement on Friday that it would continue to engage with LSE shareholders and that its offer was in their best interests. LSE did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday.; 0
0328.00008; A source close to HKEX said the Asian trading house was confident some LSE investors were interested in their offer and that it had a chance of success. They pointed out that around 15 of the top 20 LSE shareholders also had stakes in HKEX. But the past decade has seen a series of attempts at cross-border exchange deals fail, thwarted by regulators and politicians even when both companies have favored the deal.; 0
0328.00009; HKEX says it has had constructive initial discussions with regulators and policymakers. However, regulatory sources in Britain and Italy  -  where LSE owns Borsa Italiana  -  said they had yet to hold substantive talks with HKEX on the deal.; 0

0336.00011; He said: To stress to the house, under the 1986 Insolvency Act, the official receiver's liquidator may indeed seek to overturn a range of transactions made prior to the liquidation and, to be clear, that includes things like these bonuses which are being mentioned.; 0

0337.00001; Wednesday, 25 September 2019, 17:53 Last update: about 7 hours ago  A man who lost €60,000 which he had invested in a failed plan to import gold from Sierra Leone has lost a case he filed to recover his investment.; 1
0337.00002; John Cortis and Mark Anthony Portelli had decided to set up a limited liability company together with a diplomat from the Sierra Leone embassy in Libya and an experienced gold trader with a gold exporter's licence.; 0
0337.00003; The company was registered to Portelli, with the diplomat and a holding company listed as its shareholders.; 0
0337.00004; Cortis had invested €60,000 in the venture after some convincing from Portelli.; 1
0337.00005; Cortis also made a further €4,800 outlay to cover export expenses.; 1
0337.00006; Under the deal, Cortis would receive all his money back, plus 33% of the profits.; 1
0337.00007; At the time, gold was valued at US$33,000 per kilogram.; 0
0337.00008; The following day, Cortis and Portelli, appearing on behalf of the registered company signed a constitution of debt.; 0
0337.00009; But after some time, having received neither gold nor profits Cortis had asked for an explanation. Portelli had replied that the order had been cancelled and the money had been invested elsewhere. Portelli had explained to the court that gold had risen in price, combined with the start of the rainy season and an outbreak of Ebola in Sierra Leone had made gold mining more dangerous.; 0
0337.00010; Cortis took Portelli to court for repayment of the outstanding debt, at the time €52,800 but which was later partly repaid, leaving a balance of €6,284.81.; 1
0337.00011; Cortis had insisted that the money had been a loan, while Portelli had argued that it had been a commercial investment.; 0
0337.00012; The applicant insisted that he had entrusted his friend with the money without any particular conditions, and had signed a paper on the insistence of his friend.; 0
0337.00013; But Portelli had said the opposite, pointing out that what had been signed had been a deed of constitution of debt with the gold trading company as the debtor, not Portelli. The First Hall, Civil Court, presided over by Mr Justice Joseph Zammit McKeon, found in favour of Portelli, saying Cortis' arguments had been unrealistic.; 0
0337.00014; Cortis had based his action around a loan, not fraud, noted the court, adding that it was useless arguing that he had neither read the document he had signed nor had sought advice, as he didn't know how to read or write.; 0
0337.00015; In addition to this, Cortis had opted not to be named as a shareholder in the company after receiving advice that he risked losing his social benefits if he did so. Cortis had chosen to risk his money without obtaining appropriate cover, possibly enticed by the large profit margin far in excess of interest rates on bank deposits, said the judge.; 0

0338.00003; About ESOPs he is even more specific, referencing not only the oft-quoted national numbers of ESOPs, participants, and assets, but including the Fort Wayne ESOP community, comprised of 10 ESOP companies with 1,785 total participants and approximately $96.4 million in total assets. He says further that ESOP businesses are more profitable and productive, last longer in the marketplace and lay off fewer workers during downturns.; 0

0339.00004; Also, do you really know women who aren't working because of the tax credit?; 0
0339.00005; Of course not. The unemployment rate is ridiculously low now, and any qualified parent can name his/her price (his comment was also sexist). There are thousands of doctors, lawyers, pharmacists, teachers and academics who think they are better qualified to raise their children to school age, and that marriage and home are too important to give up for a tax credit.; 0

0343.00011; After taking possession of the ignition key with a strange triangular head (remember, this was the height of the Ford/Mazda mashup), I marched down to Future Shop  -  think Best Buy before that company bought the place  -  and was sent into immediate sticker shock by the cost of Sony subwoofers and Alpine decks. A hasty trip to the local pawn shop revealed prices that were much more my speed.; 0
0343.00012; Sure, it was a terrible waste of money but I was promptly able to shake the license plate off that little Escort and trigger car alarms in the tight confines of the streets of downtown St. John's.

0345.00059; Your post about reading comprehension seems to hide a thinly veiled contempt for people who worry about their second amendment rights being limited by politicians who usually don't know the first thing about the things they want to ban other than a rudimentary knowledge, and the idea that by doing so they can gather like-minded political support. Your not-about-guns post also has a tone to it that implies that it is OK for uniformed Federal agents to bang on a citizen's door and confiscate their rifles and they shouldn't be concerned it's just the one kind of rifle, relax, comply- or go to jail. Your post was actually about guns.; 0
0345.00060; And yes, I interpret the words to mean what I fear the writer is tying to say.; 0
0345.00061; And you are correct again, in the sense that it is a stretch to say, for example, Beto O'Rourke literally articulated a desire to confiscate all guns as he only mentioned the AR15 ( we can only assume this includes the AR 15 platform of common rifles), and the oft maligned AK 47 (and assuming he means the non automatic versions of these rifles that are already strictly limited). He did not say all guns I agree. He stopped just short of listing more.; 0
0345.00062; Poor English reading comprehension?; 0
0345.00063; I read (listened) to what Beto said many times to be clear and understood it all too well.; 0
0345.00064; I understand that this just-one-kind of gun is really many guns, possibly, yes I'll say it, all guns. I do not, as you suggest, misinterpret his remarks, I heard him imply much more than your naive, trusting ear did. I'll explain for you before you confirm to yourself that I have fallen into your trap and am making this argument about guns and not your intended subject, reading comprehension, you have already done just that.; 0
0345.00065; Let's examine what it is you are implying and how I am responding. Your statement that some gun rights advocates are at least partially illiterate and can't understand the concept of 'specific' is born of your own misunderstanding of the issue.; 0
0345.00066; They say they just want to ban and confiscate the AR 15, for example.; 0
0345.00067; What does that really mean?; 0
0345.00068; What makes this specific gun so specific and what is it that they are really talking about banning? It is a semiautomatic rifle, one of thousands of models of semiautomatic rifles- defined as, well, semiautomatic.; 0
0345.00069; It also, like thousands of other models, has a detachable magazine. Why confiscate just this one model?; 0
0345.00070; NY State decided it was the capacity of their magazines that was the problem.; 0
0345.00071; So they banned them (the magazines) and only allow a 7 round magazine.; 0
0345.00072; The gun haters seem satisfied for now. Here comes Beto. He said he'll take the rifle from you there anyway .; 0
0345.00073; If the magazine was the problem, and that part has already been mitigated there, why take it?; 0
0345.00074; And why not take the Mini14, or the Mini30? The Remington seven or eight round semiautomatic hunting rifle?; 0
0345.00075; Because it's not all about the magazine and an AR 15, specifically.; 0
0345.00076; It's because it's semiautomatic. Don't be fooled, when a gun grabber starts out saying they only want to ban a specific firearm, you cannot believe them (and even if that were actually true, I don't want to lose my trusted rifle).; 0
0345.00077; Beto and his ilk will start out confiscating a whole class of guns. He started to actually say this out loud with- your AR15, your AK47….; 0
0345.00078; but stopped short of listing them all.; 0
0345.00079; Let's look further into your assertion that what they want to confiscate is clearly spelled out. Beto also mentioned ammunition in his remarks.; 0
0345.00080; He was so gun-grabbing roiled up he let the cat out of the bag that transformed into the gun argument elephant in the room. The slip betrayed his true, unspoken just yet, desire.; 0
0345.00081; He said they will confiscate ammunition that is designed to wound and kill.; 0
0345.00082; That is essentially all ammunition.; 0
0345.00083; That means all firearms.; 0
0345.00084; No spelled out 'specifics' anymore as you maintain. Donning my critical thinking/ English language comprehension hat, I suggest that you are correct, the gun control argument is fouled by poor comprehension, but it is yours, not those defenders of the 2nd amendment that read English and know what banning guns with slippery language really means. Subjective bias has nothing to do with it.; 0
0345.00085; The words and their implications are universal banning specific classes of guns, and going further by banning ammunition, means just what it means.; 0
0345.00086; And, if they come, I will reluctantly give up the rifle, shamefully, because I am a law abiding citizen.; 0

0346.00001; BONN (Reuters) - A banker at the center of a trading scheme German prosecutors say resulted in hundreds of millions of euros of illegitimate tax rebates told a court the scheme had taken on an industrial scale involving a network of banks and other institutions.; 0
0346.00002; FILE PHOTO: State Prosecutor Anne Brorhilker before the trial of two British bankers accused of involvement in fraudulent Cum-Ex tax rebates at a court in Bonn, Germany, September 4, 2019. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay/File Photo  Martin Shields, a former investment banker, said that a web of banks, investors and brokers had organized the circular trades, making multiple tax reclaims and sharing the profit.; 0
0346.00003; I am not before you to deny my involvement, but to explain it, Shields told the court in Bonn on Wednesday.; 0
0346.00004; The trial is the first in a wider investigation aimed at recovering billions from banks which prosecutors say profited from such schemes.; 0
0346.00005; Germany estimates the schemes cost it more than 5 billion euros ($5.5 billion) in total. Prosecutors allege that players in the so-called cum-ex scheme misled the state into thinking a stock had multiple owners who were each owed a dividend and a tax credit.; 1
0346.00006; Shields' testimony is a critical building block in pursuing others potentially involved.; 0
0346.00007; The case, Germany's biggest post-war fraud investigation, is being closely followed in London and Frankfurt, where much of the trading was organized, according to bankers and court documents.; 0
0346.00008; German state prosecutor Anne Brorhilker this month outlined criminal charges against Shields and fellow British banker Nicholas Diable, who she said organized a network of traders and lenders to make double tax reclaims with sham share trades. Brorhilker said the two men, who face a possible jail term and a state order to repay any profits they made, had been involved in organizing bogus share trades in companies including carmaker BMW and airline Lufthansa.; 0
0346.00009; The alleged scheme involved trading shares rapidly around a syndicate of banks, investors and hedge funds to give the impression of numerous owners, each entitled to a tax rebate.; 0
0346.00010; Shields, a 41-year-old engineering graduate, said he regretted his involvement in the trading scheme but that the practice was common knowledge in the industry and that he had no reason to believe at the time that it was legally questionable.; 0
0346.00011; This was not the clandestine approach of a few, he said, describing it as the clear and openly communicated expectation of most banks and their customers. Diable is expected to address the court on Thursday. His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.; 0
0346.00012; Brorhilker has estimated that the alleged scheme she is prosecuting cost Germany some 450 million euros in lost taxes. She said the two men had started it when working at German bank HVB, before moving to a small investment firm, tapping a wide network of contacts to arrange the trades, sometimes splitting the profit made with banks.; 1
0346.00013; Shields named banks and financial institutions he said were involved in the scheme, including Warburg, Deutsche Bank and Deutsche Boerse's trade settlements arm Clearstream.; 0
0346.00014; Last month, prosecutors raided the offices of Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE) as part of the wider probe. Warburg has been included in the German trial and may have to repay any profit made from the schemes.; 0
0346.00015; A spokesman for Warburg has said that it had not received such multiple tax rebates and had never set out to do so.; 0
0346.00016; HVB, which has blamed its involvement on wrongdoing by individuals, declined further comment.; 0
0346.00017; A spokesman for Deutsche Boerse said it was fully cooperating with the authorities. A Deutsche Bank spokesman said it had been involved with clients' cum-ex deals but that it now takes a critical view of these transactions and is cooperating with the authorities. Germany changed and clarified the law in 2007, 2009 and 2012 to prevent cum-ex trades, but the case has fueled mistrust of banks among ordinary Germans.; 0
0346.00018; The discovery of the trades in Germany and Denmark, where tax authorities say they lost $2 billion in rebates, prompted investigations by other countries including Austria and Belgium, which have found they were also affected, albeit on a far smaller scale.

0347.00007; Your technology and our talent can change the world, your scale and our skills can speed up global economic growth.; 0
0347.00008; Your prudent method and our pragmatic mind can write new stories in management, he said. Your rational ways and our human values can show the path which the world is looking for.; 0
0347.00009; And if there is any gap anywhere, I will personally act as a bridge. Modi referred to his government's ambition of making India a $5 trillion economy in five years and outlined plans to spend $1.3 trillion on new physical infrastructure and billions of dollars on social infrastructure, adding these represented investment opportunities for global businesses.; 0
0347.00010; From this stage, I want to say this is just the start, there is a long way to go. This journey is a golden opportunity for the global business world to partner with India, he said.; 0
0347.00011; Today, India is in a unique position where our rapid growth enables us to cater to diverse demand. Our people are rapidly defeating poverty, moving up the economic ladder with increasing purchasing power.; 0
0347.00012; Thus if you want to invest in a market where there is a scale, come to India, he added.; 0
0347.00013; India, Modi said, is the best investment destination for those looking to tap a market where the middle class is aspirational and has a global outlook, where the youth make large-scale use of the app economy for needs ranging from food to hyper-local delivery, where one of the largest infrastructure ecosystems is expanding at a fast pace, where cities are being modernised, and where the defence sector has been opened like never before through Make in India. The Prime Minister also said India is unique for its decisiveness despite being a diverse and federal democracy, with a focus on seamless, inclusive and transparent systems. An unwieldy network of taxes had been replaced by the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime and the intellectual property rights and trademark regime had been made stronger.; 0
0347.00014; An insolvency and bankruptcy code had been introduced, and tax-related laws and tax on equity investments were being reformed to bring them at par with global regimes, he added. Modi also noted India's progress on several indices, including a 10-rank jump in the global logistics performance index, a 13-rank jump in the global competitive index and the 65-rank jump in the World Bank's ease of doing business index.; 0
0347.00015; During a question-and-answer session with Bloomberg LP founder Michael Bloomberg, Modi described climate change as one of the world's biggest concerns and said India's lifestyle was an example for the world. We see the earth as our mother and we don't have the right of exploitation...We understand need, and there is no place for greed, he said.; 0
0347.00016; More than the actions of governments, the behaviour of citizens can help tackle the challenge of global warming, he said.; 0
0347.00017; Modi added India now planned to add 450 GW of renewable energy and the country could become a model for nuclear power if the problem of fuel supply is resolved. While highlighting his government's plan to launch a campaign on Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary on October 2 against single-use plastic, Modi said India, a poor country with the world's third largest coal reserves, couldn't ignore this resource. But we can change the way of mining to ensure there is no damage to the environment.; 0
0347.00018; We can take up coal gasification for clean energy, and I invite the world to invest in this field for the environment-friendly use of coal, he said. Asked how India planned to achieve the target of becoming a $5 trillion economy, Modi said the country would have to meet global benchmarks in laws and governance and ease regulations to increase the confidence of investors. He added that investors should be inspired by India's democracy and a judicial system that uses English, where there would be no problem of interpretation.; 0
0347.00019; He also referred to investment opportunities in the form of his government's ambitious infrastructure plans to create next generation airports, faster trains, electrification, improved roads and tens of millions of homes.; 0
0347.00020; Besides, there are opportunities for businesses worldwide in value addition, food processing, organic farming, Ayushman Bharat, the world's largest health assurance scheme with a requirement of 2,000 new hospitals, and Digital India, which envisages an optic fibre network for 600,000 villages. Answering a question on the role played by social media, Modi said this is a powerful instrument for democracy and good governance that he had personally benefited from. However, he acknowledged social media could be an organised way to spread bad things and fake news.; 0
0347.00021; He particularly highlighted the need for technology to verify information forwarded on social media. Punit Renjen, CEO of Deloitte Global, in New York, told news agency ANI the meeting was excellent and that the Prime Minister had laid out plan for the growth opportunity in India.

0352.00001; Lesson learned: 'Watch your balance sheet like a hawk,' CFO says Amplify Credit Union's CFO John Orton argues your income statement won't give you the heads-up you need when sales drop and debt service obligations start to mount.; 0
0352.00002; CC: Marina Kozyr  By  Robert Freedman  Sept. 15, 2019  In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, John Orton's fast-growing business took a nose-dive.; 0
0352.00003; He was part owner of a private equity-backed company that was going around the country acquiring antique malls and using increased sales to service its expanding debt load. But consumer interest in antiques, a discretionary purchase that tends to do well when people are feeling upbeat and confident, waned in the uncertain and fearful environment that followed the attacks and pushed his company into bankruptcy.; 0
0352.00004; But Orton, the long-time CFO of Amplify Credit Union in Austin, Texas, learned a lesson from his earlier company's struggles.; 0
0352.00005; That lesson has helped him be a better finance executive, he believes. We thought we were on a trajectory for an IPO at some point when roll-ups were a little more in vogue, he said in a CFO Thought Leader podcast last week.; 0
0352.00006; Aside from the national tragedy, we saw in the months after 9/11 our sales fall by half.; 1
0352.00007; We had leases going up. We had debt payments due on our mergers.; 0
0352.00008; So, it put our business into a tailspin. The world went from rose-colored glasses to a chapter 11 filing within four years.; 0
0352.00009; His mistake, Orton said, was his focus on the income statement almost to the exclusion of everything else.; 0
0352.00010; What he should have been focusing on just as much was the balance sheet, because that would have alerted him to trouble down the road in the event of a fall in sales. We were very focused on delivering income, and EBITDA, and sales growth, and consummating mergers to keep our venture capital partners happy, grow the business, and try to get bought out or go to an IPO, he said. So, the way we looked at the balance sheet was an afterthought.; 0
0352.00011; What snuck up on us was, as we were going past 2001 and into 2002 and 2003, we had a lot of debt service coming due on acquisitions that we'd done in the years prior, and so that, plus a 12% yield to our VC investors, really created a situation where we had a high fixed-cost business. Orton said that, had he been more forward-looking, he would have seen his debt service doubling and tripling over the following few years and that was unsustainable in all but the most optimistic scenarios.; 0
0352.00012; You have to watch your balance sheet like a hawk, and not just your current commitments, he said. If I had been more forward-looking, I would have seen in 2002 and 2003 that my debt service was going to double or triple.; 0
0352.00013; I think we were under the illusion that, as the business continued to grow and succeed, all the debt service would be taken care of by sales growth, and when that didn't materialize ... wow, we were upside-down in a hurry.; 0
0352.00014; Orton said the company emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a relatively good position, in part because of the company's decision to be open about all aspects of the process. It took about nine months to get through that, Orton said.; 0
0352.00015; Only about 20% of companies that enter Chapter 11 successfully exit.; 0
0352.00016; I actually went around to our different sites, put on roadshows with our employees and key customers right after the filing, and provided monthly updates to them.; 0
0352.00017; I think that open line of communication kept a lot of key customers from leaving.; 0
0352.00018; Orton credited his appreciation for openness to two negative experiences he had when he first started out in business in the early 1980s. In an early job out of college, at Arthur Andersen, where he worked as a COBOL computer coder, his manager was so frustrated with his performance he threw a book at him and walked out. It was about 11:30 at night and we were the last two people there, he said.; 0
0352.00019; In his next job, this time working in the finance department, the company, saddled with a massive inventory problem, instituted widespread layoffs in a heavy-handed way that left a sour taste in employees' mouths.; 0
0352.00020; No notice, no severance, no nothing, he said. It made me realize you can be successful in business without being a jerk. Orton says he tries to make openness a characteristic of everything he does and he thinks it's been a major part of any success he's had over the years.; 0
0352.00021; At Amplify, when Orton came on board, around 2006, the company had about $300 million in assets. Today, it's at $1 billion, making it one of the larger credit unions in the country.; 0
0352.00022; During that time, the company has shifted, as most financial institutions have, from a bricks-and-mortar focus to an online and mobile focus. It's been a very digital-first approach for us, he said.; 0
0352.00023; Boring banks and credit unions by necessity are having to become much more technically oriented. He said he works with Salesforce on its CMS, a company called Fiserv on its core banking applications, and a company called Q2 on its mobile applications  -  this last one a must to stay relevant to millennials.; 0
0352.00024; You can check your deposit balances, your loan application, and you can even do a loan application on a mobile device and we can push notices to you if your account balances get below a certain level, he said.; 0
0352.00025; Amplify had some 90 applications tied to its core system when he started and now the goal is to whittle that down to about 30 so it's more manageable, better integrated, and easier for everyone to learn.; 1
0352.00026; We used to take more of a best-of-breed approach no matter what the application was but then you end up with IT systems that are pretty unwieldy, he said. That is a lot of vendors to manage, a lot of training for new employees.; 0
0352.00027; We decided that, an application that meets 80% to 90% of need, but maybe slightly short of best-in-breed, but integrates better, is just a better long-term solution for us, easier to manage, probably lower cost, and hopefully, since it's integrated, easier to use for our customers.; 1
0352.00028; His role in this process has been to review and negotiate contracts with the vendors, and then track whether the technology is having the results the executive team wanted.; 0
0352.00029; I'm known as the accountability guy that looks back at ROIs on investments and says, 'Well, did we achieve the customer growth that we expected to see? Did we see the loan or deposit growth? The increase in service offerings?; 0
0352.00030; The number of products per household?'; 0
0352.00031; So, I'm the guy who follows behind these investment projects to make sure we're getting the results we expected, and if not, I want to know where we got off track and what we can do to deliver the investment returns we were expecting.; 0
0352.00032; The company is hoping the technology will enable it to keep competing even as its competition changes.; 0
0352.00033; In addition to other credit unions and community banks, it's competing against newer online players, like Ally and Marcus.; 0
0352.00034; A lot of our customers are looking at our rates and looking at those [online players] and in some cases saying, 'Can you match what I can get at Ally for this two-year CD?' he said. Going forward, robotic process automation (RPA) is expected to play an increasing role in his company. He's using it to automate repetitive accounting and finance tasks.; 0
0352.00035; In the accounting world, we've all done reconciliation at some point in our careers and it's a pretty mundane, low value-add task, he said, but you can now  -  and we're doing this at Amplify  -  deploy software that will take sets of numbers and look for commonalities and reconcile the deviations and then at the end of the process, if they can't perfectly reconcile the account, it'll spit out the open items to be reconciled, and then you can add human value at the end.; 0
0352.00036; So, I see a lot of potential for us. The next deployment for RPA will be in loan application processing.; 0
0352.00037; We can have software scan loan apps and summarize information and be given an initial recommendation on a loan, he said.; 0
0352.00038; And then we would have a loan officer look at that, and if everything looks good, check the box, and the loan is approved for funding. So I think in our industry and certainly others, RPA is going to play an increasing role and to me that's exciting.; 0
0352.00039; One bit of advice Orton had for young finance executives is to get out of their comfort zone and get training in communications, including public speaking, because as much as finance skills are important, so is being able to tell the story of the company, because that's what builds trust.; 0
0352.00040; As finance people, we tend to be introverted, but it's important to be good communicators, he said.; 0

0353.00002; The aged care industry is not only one of the fastest growing industries in Australia, it is also one of the most complex, as anybody faced with moving to aged care accommodation knows.; 0
0353.00003; To make matters worse, the rules are continually changing - the result is complexity piling on complexity. There will be a major change on 1 October: an adjustment to the maximum permissible interest rate (MIPR), which is used to calculate aged care accommodation costs.; 0
0353.00004; The rate today is 5.54 per cent p.a., and it will drop to 4.98 per cent p.a.; 0
0353.00005; On the surface this would appear to make aged care cheaper, but as always, there are winners and losers.; 0
0353.00006; First, you need to understand how the system works. Whatever you don't pay as a lump sum refundable accommodation deposit (RAD) on entry, you pay as a daily charge (known as a DAP), which is calculated at the MPIR.; 0
0353.00007; So if the Market Price RAD is $400,000 and you pay $200,000, you will pay the remaining $200,000 at 5.54 per cent interest as a daily fee, which is $30.36 a day.; 1
0353.00008; If you pay the full RAD there is no interest (DAP) pay no RAD and you will pay a DAP which is the interest on the full amount: $22,160.; 1
0353.00009; The winners will be those who pay the market price for their accommodation. At today's rate, a RAD of $400,000 would have an equivalent daily payment of $61 a day.; 0
0353.00010; Under the new rate, the equivalent daily payment is $55 a day, a saving of just over $2000 a year by moving in 10 days later.; 1
0353.00011; Age Care Guru Rachel Lane points out that the losers are people who are classified as low means.; 0
0353.00012; For them, a drop in the interest rate actually increases the price of their lump sum - this may seem illogical and unfair, but it's true.; 0
0353.00013; Suppose the market price RAD for a facility was $400,000. If a person had $1 million of assets, the maximum they could pay would be $400,000.; 1
0353.00014; Now think about Shirley, who is a full pensioner with $165,000 of assessable assets. Shirley qualifies as a low means resident and her means-tested daily accommodation contribution (DAC) is $55 a day.; 0
0353.00015; If she moved in today, the MPIR would give her an equivalent lump sum refundable accommodation contribution (RAC) of almost $366,000 - an impossible task for someone with $165,000.; 1
0353.00016; But the way the RAC is calculated, under the lower MPIR next month, the equivalent lump sum will be just under $407,000 - harder still and now more than double her total assets.; 0
0353.00017; This is the irony - a person of limited means pays more than a millionaire.; 0
0353.00018; The rate you pay is set on the day you enter care. So what can Shirley do?; 0
0353.00019; One option is to move in before 1 October, which would reduce her RAC amount by around $40,000.; 1
0353.00020; Another option, if she moves in after 1 October, is to restructure her assets.; 0
0353.00021; Simple asset reduction strategies such as gifting and pre-paying funeral expenses could have a big impact on her cost of care. She may also wish to seek advice about purchasing an income stream with an asset-test exempt amount.; 0
0353.00022; Let's say Shirley reduced her assets of $165,000 through a gift of $10,000 and pre-paying her funeral expenses for $15,000. Her DAC would reduce from $55 a day to $43 a day (a saving of just over $4,300 a year). Her equivalent lump sum would reduce by almost $88,000!; 1
0353.00023; Purchasing an income stream with an asset-test exempt amount could reduce her cost of aged care further the extent of the benefit will depend on the amount she invests and her age. This is why, though many low means residents feel they can't afford financial advice, I think they can't afford not to get it.; 0
0353.00024; Just make sure you find a financial advisor who understands the aged care system - ideally a retirement living and aged care specialist. +++++++++++  Question: After your reading your article on Australia's version of a death tax l have a query.; 0
0353.00025; If one has paid 30 per cent tax on their concessional contributions due to earning above $250,000 does the full 17 per cent still apply or would only an additional 2 per cent apply?; 1
0353.00026; Answer: The tax you refer to is 15 per cent plus Medicare levy and applies to that portion of the taxable component of a deceased's superannuation that is left to a non-dependent.; 0

0353.00031; I am wondering if it's a good strategy to withdraw money from my superannuation to pay out the loan.; 0
0353.00032; Are we allowed to do this and are there any disadvantages in doing so?; 0
0353.00033; Answer: Take advice, because to access your super prior to 65 you will need to satisfy a condition of release. It is possible that you may have done this if you have recently started a new job but that will depend on the facts.; 0
0353.00034; Keep in mind that the interest on the investment loan is tax deductible, which reduces the effective cost to you while you are working.; 0
0353.00035; I would imagine that the returns on your superannuation would be greater than the net cost of the investment loan, so my advice would be to preserve the status quo and leave things as they are.; 0

0356.00001; Google has announced that use of its Google Pay platform has tripled to 67 million users in India. In a series of announcements Google renewed its commitment to the Indian market, which probably represents its greatest growth opportunity despite the relatively low disposable income of most of its inhabitants.; 0
0356.00002; The internet giant has been investing heavily in India for a few years and seems to be happy with the returns. With a population of over a billion, 67 million users is a relatively small proportion, but it's likely to keep growing rapidly as the Indian government tries to phase out cash in a bid to tackle the black economy.; 0
0356.00003; The growth in Google Pay use also coincides with a boom in smartphone ownership in the country as companies like Xiaomi manage to offer them at the right price point. Another Google investment unique to India is a free phone line launched in partnership with Vodafone-Idea that allows even those people who can only afford 2G basic phones to use Google.; 0

0358.00001; Rachel Fixsen  Nick Reeve  Most UK pension trustees are prepared for new rules regarding responsible investment, according to a survey by Hymans Robertson  -  although 80% have reported implementation challenges. The consultancy firm reported that 96% of trustees were prepared for rule changes coming in from 1 October.; 0
0358.00002; From then, trustees of defined benefit (DB) and defined contribution (DC) pension schemes in the UK will have to agree a formal approach to responsible investment and include it within their 'Statement of Investment Principles' documents. The Hymans Robertson poll found that nearly three quarters of trustees questioned (70%) supported the introduction of new rules, with only 7% opposing them.; 0
0358.00003; Simon Jones, head of responsible investment at Hymans Robertson, said: The objective of the regulations is to drive changes in behaviour by asset owners, rather than simply being a box-ticking exercise.; 0
0358.00004; Responsible investment should form an integral part of trustees' approach to investment decisions, he added. They should ensure that, where possible, the risks posed by environmental, social and governance factors are considered, to the extent that they could materially affect financial outcomes. The study also found that:  65% of trustees claimed to know a lot about the upcoming regulations 49% said implementing a responsible investment strategy would improve investment returns and 34% believed that scheme members would be the main beneficiaries.; 0
0358.00005; Simon Jones, Hymans Robertson  While trustees' support for, enthusiasm about and commitment to these regulations is a big step in the right direction for ensuring responsible investment is at the heart of investment decision making, it shouldn't be considered 'job done', said Jones.; 0
0358.00006; It is vital that responsible investment doesn't drop off the priority list once the deadline for meeting the regulatory requirements has passed, but rather that trustees continue to embed responsible investment into their day-to-day activities.; 0
0358.00007; In order to promote the change in attitude towards investing, trustees had to continue challenging their advisers and managers, Jones added. The poll was conducted between June and August 2019, and questioned 51 trustees of DB schemes larger than £50m and DC schemes with more than 500 members.; 0
0358.00008; The Hymans survey followed a similar poll of more than 100 scheme trustees and managers by law firm Sackers.; 0
0358.00009; It reported that a lack of viable products was a barrier to greater ESG implementation, as cited by 28% of respondents.; 0
0358.00010; More and better products would also help the development of DC default funds with regards to ESG investment, the law firm reported.; 0
0358.00011; Stuart O'Brien, partner at Sackers, said: Trustees are under pressure to achieve and demonstrate compliance with a growing list of requirements to increasingly tight timeframes. Despite these broader concerns, there was a clear recognition of the importance of ESG and climate issues to pension scheme investments from respondents, whose trustee boards are working hard to comply with their fiduciary duties and achieve the best outcomes for their members. Advisers have a significant and ongoing role in supporting trustees through these successive changes to regulation, particularly as changes in a scheme's investment strategy, and subsequent material changes to its investments, will take time to achieve.; 0

0359.00006; Then, a brochure came in the mail from a Canadian pharmacy advertising the drug for a fraction of the price  -  $684 for 30 days. He purchased a three-month supply and got it in the mail days later. There are just so many inequities (in prescription drug prices), he said.; 0
0359.00007; To go from paying $10 to $2,400, that's a tough pill to swallow. listen live  watch live  Roehl joins an unknown number of North Dakotans who seek out lower drug prices in other countries, particularly Canada.; 0

0359.00023; Purchasing prescriptions drugs from Canadian pharmacies is a phenomenon not commonly talked about in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration prohibits importing prescription drug medication, except for people who buy drugs in small amounts for personal use.; 0
0359.00024; The cost of prescription drugs is lower in Canada and some other countries because their governments run their health care systems and are able to negotiate prices with drug manufacturers.; 0

0359.00027; Some states have enacted laws that allow for prescription drug importation from other states, but no such law exists in North Dakota. In July, the Trump administration announced plans to allow for pilot projects developed by states, pharmacies or drug manufacturers to import certain prescription medications from Canada. It's unclear when these programs could be implemented, as the administration has to go through a rulemaking process that could take months to years.; 0
0359.00028; In North Dakota, lawmakers are looking to jump-start legislation related to prescription drug price transparency. George Keiser, R-Bismarck, proposed a bill draft modeled after drug transparency legislation that passed in Texas this year. The bill draft requires information be reported by drug manufacturers, pharmacy benefit managers and health insurance companies.; 0
0359.00029; Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, are referred to as middlemen in the prescription drug supply chain who negotiate prices with drug manufacturers for health care companies.; 0
0359.00030; The bill would require manufacturers to report every time the price of their drugs rises more than 10% in a year or 40% or more over five calendar years. PBMs also would be required report data annually, including the amount of rebates they collect from manufacturers, and health insurance companies also would have to report data on prescription drug costs.; 0
0359.00031; The information would be submitted to the state Board of Pharmacy and then published on a public website.; 0
0359.00032; Committee members last week mostly expressed support for the proposed legislation, which still has a long way to go before it's introduced during the 2021 legislative session.; 0
0359.00033; Keiser told the Tribune the bill likely will go through a number of amendments.; 0
0359.00034; What this is attempting to do is begin to bring transparency to the marketplace and the justification for (increasing drug prices), Keiser said. The key to this legislation  -  the most important element for me  -  is, you want to increase (the cost of) a drug 10% within a year, that's fine, just tell us why.; 0
0359.00035; The data will in turn help state health policymakers understand the problem and look for solutions, according to Keiser. The public doesn't know what's involved.; 0

Tip: Long-Term Coverage. 1035 exchanges can be used to exchange a life insurance policy, modified endowment contract, or an annuity contract for a long-term care policy.; 0

0363.00003; Consult a tax professional before considering an exchange. Source: American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance, 2018  According to the most recent information available, Americans have individual life insurance with a total face value of $12 trillion.1  Due to a variety of factors, these individuals may find themselves in circumstances where the specific life insurance policy or annuity contract they own does not suit their needs.2 They may want to exchange products without incurring a taxable event.; 0

0363.00005; Keep in mind that a 1035 exchange can be used only when it involves the same contract or policyholder and the same type of product. A 1035 exchange, provided certain requirements are met, gives policy or contract holders the flexibility to trade-in an older contract or policy for a newer contract or policy.; 0

0365.00005; Whilst the Supreme Court has somewhat reduced the risk of a no-deal Brexit by ensuring Parliament can make its voice heard in the final weeks to the Brexit deadline, beyond that, the ruling has not reduced uncertainty very much, City Index analyst Ken Odeluga said.; 0
0365.00006; The JP Morgan index that follows UK-listed companies making their money abroad dropped to its lowest this month as strengthening of the local currency meant the value of their U.S. earnings would diminish.; 0
0365.00007; The domestically-focussed FTSE 250 also fell 0.6% with financials and industrials dragging the most, as most market participants were still unsure as to how the already chaotic Brexit process would now play out.; 1
0365.00008; Banks with a larger exposure at home, including Barclays and RBS moved lower, bringing an earlier rebound in financial stocks to a halt. This latest twist in the Brexit narrative likely delays the decision point for Brexit but does not make it any clearer whether the UK will leave with a deal, without a deal or not at all, said Edward Park, deputy chief investment officer at Brooks Macdonald Asset Management.; 0
0365.00009; The ruling took the spotlight away from news that the United States and China will resume trade talks next month.; 0
0365.00010; After its steepest monthly fall this year amid escalating trade tensions and recession fears in August, the blue-chip index has rebounded this month as various central banks have cut interest rates to counteract slowing global growth.; 0
0365.00011; Shrugging off a wider gloom, London-listed shares of tour operator TUI rallied another 6.5% after it stuck to its earnings forecast for the year, a day after the collapse of its rival Thomas Cook.; 1
0365.00012; Tobacco and nicotine e-cigarette makers Imperial Brands and British American Tobacco shed 3.5% and 1.8%, respectively, as the U.S. Congress began hearings this week about a mystery vaping-related lung disease.; 1

0366.00003; Ryanair's board will consult with shareholders, even the 49.5% who protested about Michael O'Leary's potential €99m (£88m) jackpot, and will report back on how it will adapt its decision-making to reflect their advice and input.; 0
0366.00004; Let's take a guess, though. Ryanair's contribution may run like this: a majority is a majority, even when it's 50.5%, and, since the remuneration vote was merely advisory, we're not obliged to change a thing so we won't.; 0
0366.00005; It would not be the first company to respond to a rebellion by ignoring it. Ryanair's thin justification for the mega-scheme is that shareholders are being given a free bet.; 0
0366.00006; O'Leary only gets his big payday if annual profits hit €2bn within the next five years or the share price reaches €21 for 28 consecutive days between April 2021 and March 2024.; 0
0366.00007; From today's starting point, both measures could be regarded as tough.; 0
0366.00008; The share price is €9.92, for instance. Take a step back, though, and remember that it was almost €19 two years ago before cancelled flights, strikes and quarrels with unions hurt the valuation.; 1
0366.00009; A boss shouldn't require the whiff of an extraordinary payday to address those challenges.; 0
0366.00010; Then there is the cost of fuel, a factor entirely outside O'Leary's control but one that can turn a good year for an airline into an excellent one, which may be all he needs to clear the profit hurdle just once.; 0
0366.00011; So, yes, a bet is the right way to think of the scheme. O'Leary was bored, was thinking of retiring and wanted something to persuade him to sign up for another five-year stint.; 0
0366.00012; Since he's a very rich man who can swallow a token halving of his regular salary to €500,000, the sums had to be enormous to be interesting. But here's the rub in any all or nothing gamble designed to lock in the boss for five years.; 0
0366.00013; What will happen if, in years four or five, the targets look out of reach, again for reasons beyond O'Leary's control? Heads, he wins tails, he'll probably take an early flight out.; 0
0366.00014; Some companies are clearly better prepared for a no-deal Brexit than others.; 0
0366.00015; One is Next, which probably has nothing to do with the fact that its chief executive, Lord Wolfson, was a prominent Vote Leave supporter. Rather, the clothing chain prides itself on its future-proofing, which is why it is streets ahead of rivals in online shopping. And here it is, an 11-page Brexit impact analysis, an update on last year's version.; 0
0366.00016; What's changed?; 0
0366.00017; Well, Next now expects a £25m saving from the government's one-year temporary tariff regime.; 0
0366.00018; And it likes the transitional simplified procedures rules, saying they will significantly reduce the risk of gridlock at ports, which remains the company's major worry.; 0
0366.00019; This is a more cheerful tone than you'll generally find in retail-land.; 0
0366.00020; A no-deal Brexit is not our preferred outcome, says Wolfson, but Next is well prepared for this eventuality.; 0
0366.00021; Should we calm down and take comfort that at least one major retailer thinks the government's emergency measures have improved resilience?; 0
0366.00022; Well, Next shareholders can probably relax a little but the mistake would be to draw too many wider lessons. Next is not a food retailer, so doesn't have to worry about goods going off before they reach shelves.; 0
0366.00023; Most of its imports are from outside the EU.; 0
0366.00024; It is not running a just-in-time delivery system in the style of major car manufacturers. And, as Wolfson himself pointed out, the government hasn't said what tariffs would apply on imports from the EU after the temporary regime ends, a huge unknown. Nor did he offer any real insight into the possible whack to consumer confidence from a no-deal exit or the boost from a deal  -  it is merely an important caveat around this year's sales and profits.; 0
0366.00025; Still, Wolfson has done his job. He's described Next's preparations, applied numbers where he can and shown his methodology. It remains astonishing, or disgraceful, that other companies haven't done the same.; 0
0366.00026; Their models might look more alarming  -  but investors still have the right to see the figures. Topics  Nils Pratley; 0
0367.00001; How Much of Your Income Should You Save Every Month?; 0
0367.00002; Updated: by Cubert 6 Comments  While examining my handy dashboard excel budget last week, I focused my attention on our Stash Rate. Hard to believe, but we had somehow achieved a savings rate of 83%.; 0
0367.00003; expenses. Curious how we got there?; 0
0367.00004; Good, because this is a post that asks and attempts to answer the question, How much of your income should you save every month?; 0
0367.00005; Contents  Start with all of the take-home money you make each month.; 0
0367.00006; Lump it all together. This is your denominator.; 0
0367.00007; We'll assume a post-tax take-home amount of $8,000 per month (an annual post-tax income of $96,000 for this hypothetical household, the Smiths). Include your paycheck after taxes. Then, add in any income you make from side-hustles.; 0
0367.00008; If you've got a rental property or an AirBNB, include net income from those sources too (rent minus mortgage payments, maintenance, and administrative costs). We'll figure Mrs. Smith runs a sweet AirBNB operation out of the loft over their garage.; 0
0367.00009; This modern and well-appointed space generates $500 a month after the mortgage and expenses are taken into account.; 1
0367.00010; Be sure next to factor in mortgage principal.; 0
0367.00011; This is equity the Smith's gain back from the bank month over month, coupled with increased market value.; 0
0367.00012; Adding principal to our savings rate calculation is just as important as take-home pay. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume $300 of principal is gained each month at this stage of their mortgage.; 0
0367.00013; The final step in figuring our total monthly savings is to add up all of the money you're socking away in 401k, IRA, HSA, and 529 accounts.; 0
0367.00014; Let's assume the Smiths contribute a decent amount to their respective 401ks (enough to meet the company match plus a bit more). Let's also assume the primary health-insuring spouse (Mr. Smith) is maxing out his HSA. This adds a healthy $2,000 to the Smith's monthly savings tally.; 1
0367.00015; The denominator now stands at $10,800 ($8,000 + $500 + $300 + $2,000).; 0
0367.00016; Pretty simple so far, right?; 0
0367.00017; Just imagine if you've got four, five, or twelve rental properties kicking back principle to you each month, in addition to rental income. SCORE.; 0
0367.00018; Next, we need to figure out the numerator.; 0
0367.00019; Simply add up all of your monthly household expenses.; 0
0367.00020; These include line items such as mortgage payments, childcare, groceries, utilities, car payments (gasp!), insurance, travel, home maintenance, and so on. If you don't have an expense tracking system, this is the time to jump on THAT.; 0
0367.00021; A typical family of four could easily burn through $5,000 (or more) per month on common expenses, depending on circumstances.; 1
0367.00022; In this example, I assume $500 in monthly childcare for after-school programs.; 0
0367.00023; We should note that from birth to Kindergarten, daycare and nanny costs can easily soar to $2,000 or more per month, depending on how many kids you have and the supply and demand for childcare where you live. The savings rate equation is all set up now.; 0
0367.00024; Here's what it looks like:  ($10,800  -  $5,000) / $10,800 = .537, or, a savings rate of 54%.; 0

The same can be said for those of us who've been stuck in the cubicle for over two decades…  Our hypothetical scenario using the Smiths is a pretty aggressive plan.; 0
0367.00032; How on Earth could they possibly squeeze another nickel into savings, much less achieve an 83% savings rate? Here's the thing: The ability to retire early is not the same as committing to retiring early.; 0
0367.00033; It's an important distinction. Nothing builds more confidence in your day job than having the financial wherewithal to lose your job at any time without fear of losing a paycheck. This confidence can be channeled into strengthening your career and your control over your working life.; 0
0367.00034; That equates to raises, promotions, and higher savings rates. This concept is no different from rental properties.; 0

This would have turned a $10K investment made 20 years ago into $13,549.52 today (as of 09/24/2019).; 1

0369.00008; Another interesting datapoint we can examine is 'yield on cost'  -  in other words, we can express the current annualized dividend of 1.2 against the original $37.00/share purchase price. This works out to a yield on cost of 17.59%.; 0

0370.00001; HomeTrading for BeginnersMarket AnalysisThe Stock Market And Precious Metals On Hold  September 22, 2019 Market Analysis  At week's end we find the with a bearish, picture-perfect head and shoulders technical formation.; 0
0370.00002; The left shoulder goes back to last April, the head in early July and the right shoulder at the close of the week. So, is the market a sell as September 2019 comes to a close?; 0
0370.00003; It could be, but as I read the landscape the Federal Reserve is holding up this market.; 0
0370.00004; The Dow Jones won't go down until the FOMC says it does. But that doesn't mean the Federal Reserve intends to shower the bulls with capital gains look at how this crazy market has traded in the past year. A year ago the Dow Jones made four (4) new BEV Zeros (new all-time highs), after which it corrected 18%.; 0
0370.00005; It then recovered from this price correction where it made four (4) new BEV Zeros in early July last summer before correcting seven percent in August.; 0
0370.00006; The Dow Jones now stands once again at the threshold of market history, just short of making a new all-time high.; 0
0370.00007; But with only eight (8) new all-time highs made in the past year, are the policy makers inclined to give more to the market's bulls as we head into October?; 0
0370.00008; Dow Jones BEV  Call me a big chicken, but I don't care to speculate on what the Dow Jones (my proxy for the broad stock market) is going to do as 2019 approaches its terminal end point.; 0
0370.00009; Today's big bulls are members of the global central banking cartel, who by definition can never run out of money, and aren't primarily motivated by profits in their dealings with the financial markets.; 0
0370.00010; So, what are they after?; 0
0370.00011; What they seek is called market stability.That isn't the description ofwhat we seek from the market as we need profits to just stay in place in our inflationary economy, market losses can result in bankruptcy for us.; 0
0370.00012; Take a look at how things used to be, a time when monetary policy didn't define how markets traded, as with US T-bond yields (Red Plot) and the price of (Blue Plot) in the chart below. I placed some light vertical dashed lines on turns in the gold market, look how T-bond yields reacted to these changes in the price of gold from 1971 to August 1987.; 0
0370.00013; This relationship between the price of gold and bond yields make perfect sense, as rising gold prices (rising CPI inflation) promised T- bonds would become big losers on a total return basis. So bond buyers demand higher yields (lower bond prices) as an inflation premium.; 0
0370.00014; Lower gold prices resulted in the exact opposite reaction lower yields and higher prices in the bond market.; 0
0370.00015; Gold & US Treasury Long Bd Yield  Then in August 1987 Alan Greenspan  -  the Maestro  -  became chairman at the Federal Reserve and this connection between bond yields and the price of gold was severed.; 0
0370.00016; Gold in February 2001 began a bull market that continues to this day, which unlike the 1969 to 1980 gold bull market, has had zero impact on bond yields as monetary policy has compromised any and all connections between trends in the gold and debt markets. Former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh put it this way in January 2012:  Now that I am out of government, I can tell you what I really believe.; 0
0370.00017; -   Central banks are now so heavily influencing asset prices that investors are unable to ascertain market values. This influence is especially evident, with the Fed's purchase of government bonds, which has made it impossible for investors to use bond prices to learn anything about markets. -  Kevin M. Warsh: Former Federal Reserve Governor.; 0

0370.00019; Major Market Indexes BEV Values  It's not just the Dow Jones that is at the threshold of making market history. In the table below the Dow Jones Utility Average closed the week at a new all-time high (0.00%), while #2-15 are within 5% of doing so, or as I like to say, in scoring position for making a new all-time high.; 0
0370.00020; This is how it's been for several weeks now what's everyone waiting for? Personally I think the market is waiting for another injection of liquidity to drive these indexes into record territory, but for reasons the policy makers at the FOMC have kept from the public, they have decided to hold back on injecting their Go-Juice into the markets for the time being.; 0
0370.00021; DJI Daily OHLC  Here's the Dow Jones in daily bars. From early August to early September the Dow Jones remained range bound within the box, but then broke out in September's second week.; 0
0370.00022; It appeared to be headed into market history, until this week (Black Circle) when the Dow Jones once again came up short. The Federal Reserve continues their Quantitative Tightening (QT), the reduction of their balance sheet which they began in late 2017. With the exception of last April where they increased their balance sheet by $39.99 billion, they've reduced their holdings of US T-bonds every month since January 2018.; 0
0370.00023; Just as the Federal Reserve's three QEs provided the monetary inflation needed to inflate the financial markets out of its sub-prime mortgage funk in March 2009, the Fed's current QT is an enormous factor for calling for a deflation of market values in the future.; 0
0370.00024; Or one would think it to be.; 0
0370.00025; However, so far this QT's effect on market valuations has been minimal.; 0
0370.00026; Fed's Monthly Change In Its Holding Of UST Debt  Next to the Federal Reserve, China and Japan currently hold the largest positions in US T-bonds, but as of June 2019 the Federal Reserve holds more T-debt than the two combined.; 0
0370.00027; However in 2008 the Federal Reserve's holding of T-debt was smaller than either China or Japan.; 0
0370.00028; Doctor Bernanke's three QEshad a HUGE impact on the Fed's balance sheet.; 0
0370.00029; In the table below we see T-debt held by the Federal Reserve (#2), Japan (#3) and China (#4) down by 13.9%, 9.55% and 15.51% respectably as of June of this year.; 0
0370.00030; That's a reduction of $914 billion dollars from their max holdings.; 0
0370.00031; With the Grand Total (#1)currently at a new all-time high, I wonder who is buying all these bonds, along with all the new bonds being issued by the US Treasury.; 0
0370.00032; There are eight countries who in June saw their portfolios of T-bond at new all-time highs, but I don't see these countries being able to soak up all this supply coming into the market. But I don't know exactly what these numbers represent.; 0
0370.00033; Are they official holdings of these nation's central banks, or bonds held by private corporations, insurance companies and pension funds, or both? Foreign Holdings of US Treasury Bonds 2008-2019  Barrons Best & Intermediate Grade Bond Yields  But anyway one looks at it, there is a tremendous flow of T-bonds coming into the market, which makes me wonder why bond yields in the debt markets today are so low. Maybe it's best to just accept that it's a policy thing and just leave it at that until the walls come tumbling down.; 0
0370.00034; And come tumbling down is the correct technical term to use in a market where best grade corporate bond yields (Blue Plot below) are lower today than they were in 1955.; 0
0370.00035; US Treasury Bond Holdings Federal Reserve China & Japan  Here's a chart for the Federal Reserve, China and Japan's T-bond holdings, which like all countries included in this data, greatly increased their holdings of T-bond as a reaction to the 2007-09 sub-prime mortgage fiasco.; 0
0370.00036; I wonder if they are now having buyers regret? Here's gold's BEV chart, which is holding up pretty darn well.; 0
0370.00037; Gold broke above its BEV -27.5% line ($1360) on June 19th and hasn't looked back. This is good market action, which is another way of saying I wish the price of gold would stop playing around its BEV -20% level and go on to new all-time highs. But the market doesn't care about what you or I think, so gold will do what it's doing until it decides to break about the $1888 it saw on 22 Aug 2011.; 0
0370.00038; Gold's BEV 2008-19  I don't like it, but it is what it is. Which could mean still one more downward stab at the BEV -27.5% line before gold finally breaks into market history.; 0
0370.00039; The silver to gold ratio (SGR) has declined from 93.36 down below 80 on the first two trading days of September, and has since walked back to the 85 level.; 0
0370.00040; When you realize that a 93.36 SGR is something not seen since the early 1990s, well its one of those market extremes I like seeing, a market event that will prove to be hard to repeat in the months and years to come.; 0
0370.00041; Silver to Gold Ratio 1969  -  2019 Daily Basis  Being a market prognosticator is a hazardousoccupation, or in my case a personal hobby I enjoy sharing with my readers. I have to warn youthat my crystal ball's calibration sticker has long ago expired, and the visions seen within it are alltoo frequently foggy.; 0
0370.00042; What isn't foggy is seeing the SGR below reversing an eight year trend that began in March 2011, and that is darn bullish for gold, silver and the precious metal miners.; 0
0370.00043; When it's time to buy or sell they never ring a bell, and history shows the best time to buy is when doing so people think you're a bit unhinged.; 0
0370.00044; I expect when September 2019 is seen in the market's rear view mirror in the months and years to come, taking a position in gold and silver assets now will gain one bragging rights for making an astute move in the markets.; 0
0370.00045; However the markets are never easy we may once again test the 90s with the SGR.; 0
0370.00046; Even so, buying gold and especially silver at these prices seems a good thing to do.; 0
0370.00047; Gold (Blue Plot) and its step sum (Red Plot) below are looking good. It's obvious gold on its advancing days is advancing, while the declining days' effects on the price of gold has been minimal. Daily Gold and Step Sum  The Dow Jones and its step sum look good too.; 0
0370.00048; BUT as the step sum is a sentiment indicator, seeing it rise up as it has without seeing the Dow Jones making a new all-time high makes me suspicious that market sentiment is getting ahead of market reality. Of course seeing the venerable Dow Jones breaking into record territory would make this point moot. Dow Jones & Step Sum  So, what is a step sum?; 0
0370.00049; A step sum is a single item Advance  -  Decline Line using the daily advances and declines of a market series, like the price of gold or the Dow Jones as its inputs. What does it mean that at week's close the Dow Jones' step sum stood at 1543, as seen in the step sum tables below? I made a frequency table for the Dow Jones step sum below going back to 02 January 1900, just a few months short of 120 years of market history.; 0
0370.00050; Frequency Distribution  Every day the Dow Jones advanced its step sum gains a +1, every day the Dow Jones declined it gains a -1 with no regard to how much the Dow Jones advanced or declined.; 0
0370.00051; So the step sum is only the sum total of all the daily +1 & -1 since January 1900, and since 02 January 1900, the Dow Jones has seen 1543 more daily advances than daily declines, hence its step sum at week's close is 1543. Moving on to gold's step sum table below in the past twenty-five trading sessions its step sum has advanced by two steps, which advanced the price of gold $1.21.; 0
0370.00052; It could be better, but it could be worse too best to think of the gold market in a holding pattern waiting for higher prices. During these past twenty-five trading sessions gold's 15 count has in the main registered between +3 and -3, which is normal. It's good seeing gold's daily volatility increase to 0.56%, but as seen in the chart below, in January volatility for gold declined below 0.50% something not seen since January 2001.; 0
0370.00053; But January 2001 was a good time to buy gold, and I expect last January's low volatility will also prove to be a good time to buy gold. Gold's Daily Volatility 200 Day Moving Average  Since August 16th the Dow Jones has had a lot going for it.; 0
0370.00054; Look at all the daily advances on September 18th its 15 count registered a rare +11! Also its daily volatility has been declining and bull markets at the NYSE are low daily volatility market events.; 0
0370.00055; The only bearish thing to comment about the Dow Jones is its inability to break above to new all-time highs with all this going for it. Gold and Dow Jones Step Sum & 15 Count  What's the Dow Jones going to do when the market once again enters a cycle of more daily declines than advances, similar to or worse than what gold has seen since August 16th?; 0
0370.00056; Gold also saw its 15 count increase to +11 from 19 to 24 June of this year as the price of gold was at or below $1419.; 1
0370.00057; On the decline of gold's 15 count (an increasing frequency of declining days) the price of gold actually increased as seen in the table above.; 0
0370.00058; Could the Dow Jones see something similar to what gold did last summer when its 15 count began its decline from an 11? Maybe, but I doubt it.; 0
0370.00059; An important point I've made in the past is that monetary inflation inflates market valuations in the financial markets and real estate  -  NOT valuations in gold and silver. What inflates the valuations in the old monetary metals is DEFLATION in the financial markets and real estate, which results in capital flight from those markets into gold and silver.; 0
0370.00060; As the policy makers are having success in their imposition of stability in the stock, debt and mortgage markets, I'm not really surprised that market action in gold and silver are currently sluggish.; 0
0370.00061; I hope my readers are aware of the authoritarian behavior of the big social media tech companies in their censoring of conservative opinion on their platforms. In fact this is the Left's attack on the Bill of Rights and it needs to be opposed by good people who love their liberty. Here is a video from INFOWARS on the Bill of Rights.; 0
0370.00062; INFOWARS is an independent media outlet that is currently under attack by the Deep State. I like INFOWARS.; 0

0370.00064; I thought Alex was a bit of a crank, but an entertaining one.; 0
0370.00065; But thinking back on what he has said years ago, and comparing that with what is happening today, his INFOWARS has proven to be one, if not the most accurate, and entertaining sources of actual news available.; 0
0370.00066; INFOWARS covers topics the MSM refuse to, that by itself is reason enough to watch it.; 0

0372.00002; In addition to student loan debt, unpaid medical bills are a factor when filing for bankruptcy. In 2013, for example, approximately two million people in the United States were affected by bankruptcies for this reason alone.; 0
0372.00003; During the same year, there were 8,980 Chapter 11 bankruptcies filed and 333,626 Chapter 13s.  According to Debt.org, both a judge and a court trustee will be involved with determining whether or not a declaration of bankruptcy is valid. After evaluating the applicant's assets and liabilities, a determination will be made to have these debts discharged or repaid. Debt.org also stresses the point that even though bankruptcy may enable someone to start over, that it does affect credit scores and other financial situations.; 0
0372.00004; A Chapter 7 bankruptcy, for instance, will remain on an individual's credit report for ten years post arrangement. On the positive side, however, filing for bankruptcy may prevent or delay these and other financial actions:  Home foreclosures Vehicle repossessions Wage garnishments  When someone files Chapter 7 bankruptcy, Debt.org states that the court may release someone from being obligated to repay their debts.; 0
0372.00005; There are some assets which the filer may be able to keep because they are referred to as exempt property. These exemptions do vary depending on the state within which a bankruptcy is filed.; 0
0372.00006; That said, since state and federal laws differ on the amount of possessions that may be retained, it's important to determine which would be more beneficial.; 0
0372.00007; In order to repay some of an individual's debt, property that isn't exempt will be sold. Debt.org indicates that there is a debt limit for filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy.; 0
0372.00008; In order to determine whether someone's debt does not exceed this amount, it's important to speak with an attorney or credit counselor. This is because these amounts tend to fluctuate.; 0
0372.00009; When someone files for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the understanding is that they will be paying some of their debts in order to have others waived, according to Debt.org. This is usually the option chosen by individuals within a high income bracket or those who aren't interested in relinquishing their property. If you want to find debt relief, there's an excellent chance you're looking for a low cost bankruptcy attorney in your area.; 0

0375.00013; An interactive version of this chart can be found here.; 0
0375.00014; As you can see in the above table, Lockheed has consistently rewarded investors with rapid dividend growth. Of the 16 1-year periods during Lockheed's dividend growth streak, annual dividend growth has ranged from 9.9% to 56.9% with an average increase of 20.6% and a median increase of 16.5%.; 0
0375.00015; My preference is to look at longer periods of time to see how the business has performed.; 0
0375.00016; Of the 12 rolling 5-year periods annualized, dividend growth has ranged from 11.4% to 27.3%. The average annualized dividend growth rate has come in at 19.7% with a median growth rate of 20.5%. Image by author data source: Lockheed Martin SEC filings  Some of that rapid dividend growth has been fueled by a rising payout ratio.; 0
0375.00017; Excluding FY 2017 and including the TTM period, Lockheed's average earnings payout ratio has been 43.5%.; 0
0375.00018; Looking at the free cash flow payout ratio, the average has come to 43.7%, exclusive of FY 2012 and FY 2018.  Businesses with some kind of advantage will show it in their financials.; 0
0375.00019; Companies that routinely grow sales, cash flow generating, grow their dividends or have higher margins than competitors, have some kind of advantage whether it's switching costs, patents, brand or some other form of barrier to their business model. As such, I prefer to examine the strength of the business through its financials as well as gain insight into management's plans.; 0
0375.00020; Image by author data source: Lockheed Martin SEC filings  Lockheed has managed to grow revenue from $43.8 B in FY 2009 to $53.8 B in FY 2018. That's ~22.6% total growth or 2.3% annualized.; 0
0375.00021; The TTM period is currently showing stronger revenue growth and sits 6.9% above FY 2018's level.; 0
0375.00022; Cash flow from operations has declined from $3.5 B to $3.1 B over the same period which is roughly a 10.0% decline in total or 1.2% annually.; 0
0375.00023; The TTM period is showing a nice rebound in operating cash flow and sits at $5.9 B.  Likewise, free cash flow has seen a precipitous decline falling from $2.6 B to $1.9 B for the same period.; 0
0375.00024; That's approximately 29.4% total decline or 3.8% annually.; 0
0375.00025; However, once again the TTM period is perking back up and sits at $4.6 B.  Image by author data source: Lockheed Martin SEC filings  Since operating and free cash flow have both compressed, it should come as no surprise that Lockheed's cash flow margins have been under pressure. I generally want to see free cash flow margins above 10% as a sign of a strong cash generating business.; 0
0375.00026; Unfortunately, Lockheed has only hit that level twice over the last 10 years. Lockheed's average free cash flow margin for the last decade comes in at 6.9% and for the last 5 years it's 8.1%.; 0
0375.00027; Alternatively, I like to look at the free cash flow return on invested capital, FCF ROIC, as a way to view the profitability of a business. The FCF ROIC is the cash based return that the business earns on the capital invested in the business. In theory, if you own the entire business outright under the current capital structure that would be the annual return that the business is generating to you in cash.; 0
0375.00028; Additionally, I want to see an FCF ROIC greater than 10% as well.; 0
0375.00029; Image by author data source: Lockheed Martin SEC filings  Lockheed's FCF ROIC has seen drastic moves both higher and lower over the last decade.; 0
0375.00030; Lockheed has generally been well above the 10% threshold with just one year, FY 2012, coming in at 9.8%.; 0
0375.00031; The average FCF ROIC over the last decade has been 27.9% with the five year average at 26.3%. Lockheed's FCF ROIC might not be a model of consistency however, its profitability is generally very strong.; 0
0375.00032; When a company generates cash through its operations, I want to see a management team allocate the surplus in the following order:  Re-invest to both maintain and grow the business.; 0
0375.00033; Pay and grow the dividend with cash. Repurchase shares with remaining cash or seek out acquisitions to further grow the company. To understand how Lockheed uses its free cash flow, I calculate 3 variations of the metric, defined below:  Free Cash Flow FCF: Operating cash flow less capital expenditures.; 0
0375.00034; Free Cash Flow after Dividend FCFaD: FCF less total cash dividend payments. Free Cash Flow after Dividend and Buybacks FCFaDB: FCFaD less cash spent on share repurchases.; 0
0375.00035; The reason that I examine the free cash flow this way is that it gives me insight into management's plans and how prudent they are being with their excess cash.; 0
0375.00036; A business with strong fundamentals and a prudent management will maintain positive FCFaDB more often than not. A few years of negative FCFaDB is not a concern because the economy waxes and wanes and sometimes opportunities come up that require spending more cash than is generated by the business.; 0
0375.00037; A positive FCFaDB is also what allows management to reward shareholders with a rising dividend and share repurchases to return excess cash to owners. If a management routinely has negative FCFaDB then they will be forced to seek alternative funding via asset sales, debt or drawing down cash on the balance sheet none of which are good for me the shareholder.; 0
0375.00038; Image by author data source: Lockheed Martin SEC filings  As we saw above, Lockheed has maintained positive FCF every year over the last decade.; 0
0375.00039; Cumulatively, Lockheed has generated $31.43 B in FCF which has allowed management to pay and grow the dividend every year.; 0
0375.00040; Over the last decade Lockheed has paid out $16.11 B in dividends to shareholders in total. That puts the cumulative FCFaD at $15.31 B. Lockheed has had two years, FY 2012 and FY 2018, with negative FCFaD which is a bit of a concern.; 1
0375.00041; With a positive $15.31 B in cash flow to work with, Lockheed has been able to move to share repurchases as a way to return additional cash to shareholders with organically generated cash.; 0
0375.00042; Unfortunately, management has spent $20.05 B on share repurchases over the last decade which puts the FCFaDB at -$4.74 B. Lockheed has seen negative FCFaDB in 8 of the last 10 years.; 1
0375.00043; Image by author data source: Lockheed Martin SEC filings  The $20.05 B spent on buybacks have reduced the share count from 388.9 M in FY 2009 to 286.8 M in FY 2018.; 1
0375.00044; That's good for a 26.3% reduction in the share count or 3.3% per year.; 0
0375.00045; As I mentioned earlier, my preference is to see companies reinvest in the business with their excess cash, then move to paying and growing the dividend and only if there is still left over cash then move to share repurchases.; 0
0375.00046; The following chart shows the cash returned to shareholders portioned out between free cash flow supported dividends and share buybacks as well as buybacks funded by other sources.; 0
0375.00047; Image by author data source: Lockheed Martin SEC filings  As you can see not all of the share repurchases over the last decade have been funded from internally generated cash flow.; 0
0375.00048; Roughly 1/3 of the cash spent on share repurchases has been sourced from other means, i.e. debt, asset sales, cash on the balance sheet.; 0
0375.00049; Due to the overspending of cash flow, Lockheed's balance sheet has seen a corresponding decline. In FY 2009 the debt to capitalization ratio was roughly 55% however, by the end of FY 2018 debt accounted for 91% of the capitalization ratio.; 0
0375.00050; Total debt has risen by over $9.0 B over that time.; 0
0375.00051; Image by author data source: Lockheed Martin SEC filings  The debt on Lockheed's balance sheet is overly burdensome at this time.; 0
0375.00052; Using TTM data, Lockheed's free cash flow interest coverage ratio was 6.7x which is excellent coverage.; 0
0375.00053; Management could also pay down the entire debt load with 3.0 years of the TTM FCF and 6.4 years of the TTM FCFaD. My preference is still to see less debt than more and it appears that management is working on reducing the debt load after it peaked in FY 2015 at $15.3 B and is now at $13.5 B.  When it comes to valuing a business, one method that I like to use is the minimum acceptable rate of return, MARR, analysis.; 0
0375.00054; The MARR analysis entails estimating future earnings and dividends that a company will produce and come up with a best guess on the valuation that market participants will value that earnings stream at. If the expected return is lower than your hurdle rate, then you wait for the expected return to rise before investing or look for other opportunities.; 0
0375.00055; Analysts expect Lockheed Martin to report FY 2019 EPS of $21.21 and for FY 2020 EPS to come in at $25.36. Over the next 5 years analysts expect Lockheed to show 14.5% annual earnings growth. I then assumed that Lockheed would be able to grow earnings at 7.0% per year for the following 5 years.; 1
0375.00056; Dividends are assumed to target a 40% payout ratio for the MARR analysis. When it comes to determining the future valuation that market participants will value an earnings stream at, I like to use history as a guide. Over the last decade, Lockheed Martin has typically traded between ~10x - 25x TTM P/E ratio.; 0
0375.00057; According to Morningstar, Lockheed's 5 year average TTM P/E is 23.5x. For the MARR analysis, I'll examine P/E ratios ranging from 10x - 25x.; 0
0375.00058; Data by YCharts  [object HTMLElement]  The following table shows the potential internal rates of return that an investment in Lockheed Martin could provide at varying ending P/E ratios.; 0
0375.00059; Returns follow the assumptions above and assume a purchase price of $388.25, Friday's closing price.; 0
0375.00060; Returns include dividend payments taken in cash and are calculated through the end of calendar year 2024, 5 Year, and calendar year 2029, 10 Year.; 0
0375.00061; Additionally I like to calculate the purchase price targets that would generate the returns that I desire from my investments. The target returns that I will use to determine the price targets are 10%, typically my minimum threshold for investment, and 17%.; 0
0375.00062; The 17% is derived from the ~11% estimated 10-year earnings growth rate plus the starting dividend yield of 2.3% plus 2.25% for 25% undervaluation realized over 10 years. Dividend yield theory is a valuation methodology that looks at the historical dividend yield that a business has provided, specifically comparing the current yield to the 5-year moving average yield.; 0
0375.00063; The idea behind dividend yield theory is largely reversion to the mean.; 0
0375.00064; Image by author data source: Yahoo Finance and Lockheed Martin Investor Relations  An interactive version of this chart can be found here.; 0
0375.00065; The 5-year average dividend yield for Lockheed Martin is 2.78% which equates to a $316 share price based on the current quarterly dividend of $8.80.; 0
0375.00066; For dividend yield theory I consider the +/- 10% band to be the fair value range for the business in question which in Lockheed Martin's case would be $287-$352. That suggests that shares have possible downside risk of 9%-26%.; 1
0375.00067; Since Lockheed Martin is due to announce an increase to their dividend payment this week, the dividend yield theory values should be adjusted. Using the estimated dividend payment of $2.42, 10% higher than currently, shifts the fair value range higher to $316-$387 which suggests shares are trading at the top end of the fair value range. The big problem with owning Lockheed Martin is not related to the business fundamentals, rather it's getting over the fact that for the most part the business profits from destruction.; 0
0375.00068; I'm sure everyone wishes that the defense industry wasn't necessary, but the fact of the matter is that as long as there are people on this planet the defense industry will be here to stay.; 0
0375.00069; Lockheed isn't the most consistent company that I've looked at however, there's a lot to like about the business.; 0
0375.00070; For one, dividend growth and capital gains have been fantastic due in large part to the business improving, although valuation expansion has played a role in the impressive price improvement. Lockheed's FCF margins aren't quite where I'd like to see them at, but their FCF ROIC is very impressive while regularly coming in north of 20%.; 0
0375.00071; I do have some concerns regarding the balance sheet, but nothing that is too worrisome as the debt is manageable and interest payments are well covered by free cash flow. In addition management appears to be undergoing a deleveraging process with total debt declining ~8% since the end of FY 2015. I do expect share repurchases to play less of a part in driving shareholder returns going forward which is something to consider.; 0
0375.00072; My largest concern lies with how reliant Lockheed Martin is on government defense spending, specifically the United States.; 0
0375.00073; While I believe that defense spending will always be a part of spending by governments around the world, there's no denying that Lockheed is highly reliant on the United States government.; 0
0375.00074; According to Wikipedia, the USA spent $643 B on defense spending in 2018 which is 3.8x the next largest spender, China.; 0
0375.00075; Adding to this risk is the fact that 70% of Lockheed Martin's revenues are from the US government in 2018 with another 28% from international governments. That's a heavy reliance on government defense spending, especially from the United States, which could be at the forefront of any potential cuts in government spending both domestically and internationally.; 0
0375.00076; Based on the MARR analysis, shares of Lockheed Martin appear quite attractive if you're after 10% annualized returns.; 0
0375.00077; Even looking at 13% annualized returns, estimated earnings growth plus the dividend yield, you could still stomach roughly 20% valuation compression to a 15x TTM P/E and still generate 13% annualized returns. That's pretty impressive and due in large part to the forecast growth of earnings.; 1
0375.00078; I would peg the fair value range based on MARR between $360-$430.; 0
0375.00079; The fair value based on dividend yield theory isn't quite as generous as it ranges from $316-$387. At a current price in the market around $388, Lockheed's shares are on the high end of fair value however, you'd still be set up to capture most of the growth of the business without giving up too much from yield normalization, i.e. share price falling to have shares offer the 5-year average dividend yield.; 0
0375.00080; Given the growth expectations Lockheed Martin is really attractively valued compared to other businesses that I've looked at with similar growth profiles. Lockheed Martin looks like a solid investment based on MARR and a reasonable one based on dividend yield theory.; 0
0375.00081; I'd be tempted to initiate a position in my portfolio around current price levels however, I would look for better valuations before committing a serious amount of capital.; 0

0379.00001; September 18, 2019 By: Spencer Israel Saturday's drone strikes against Saudi Aramco oil facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais has given the oil market a shock the likes of which it hasn't seen in years, and the ramifications are heavy. Five percent of the world's daily oil output has been disrupted, or 5.7 million barrels/day, the biggest disruption in history (and bigger than the 5.6 million b/d disruption during the Iranian Revolution of 1978-79).; 1
0379.00002; With half of Saudi Arabia's oil production offline, oil had its biggest one-day gain since 2008 on Monday, and for a lucky few traders who owned the October $60 call options in WTI futures, their previously worthless contracts were suddenly worth $24 million, per Bloomberg , and the spread between Brent and WTI futures widened by as much as 37%.; 1
0379.00003; Though Saudi officials initially said the lost output would be recovered in a couple of days, it's now looking like it could take several weeks or longer for production to be fully restored. Whether we end up withdrawing oil from the Strategic Oil Reserve, as President Trump authorized, remains to be seen.; 0
0379.00004; There are approximately 1.8 billion barrels held in reserve by governments across the globe, according to Oswald Clint, senior analyst for Bernstein. Aramco, meanwhile, is considering delaying its long-awaited IPO as they deal with the fallout.; 0
0379.00005; Elsewhere, the beaten-down energy sector has suddenly found itself ripping higher.; 0
0379.00006; Oil stocks, from Apache to Whiting Petroleum, moved higher across the board, and other assets like gold, bonds, and the Canadian dollar also spiked as a general sense of global uncertainty heightened. Airline and cruise stocks also got hit, as the expected increase in oil costs are likely to have some impact, though the true extent has yet to be seen.; 0
0379.00007; The biggest takeaway right now is that the market needs to account for increased security risk to the oil markets. As Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic put it , Political-risk premiums are now back on the oil-market agenda.; 0
0379.00008; Mizuho quantified that increased risk as an added $5 per barrel.; 0
0379.00009; Goldman Sachs estimated that if oil production remained down for more than six weeks, Brent futures would likely rally to $75 per barrel.; 1
0379.00010; Standard & Poor's called it back to the U.S. economy, saying One of the biggest factors playing into our current economic outlook is uncertainty, and along with a heightened level of this, higher oil prices may be just one more nail in the coffin for this current US expansion.; 0

0381.00001; Financial Ombudsman Service  By Imogen Tew  Intrinsic has been forced to compensate Harlequin clients three times in the past year after the Financial Ombudsman Service found its representatives had given unsuitable mortgage advice to those investing in the troubled overseas property group.; 1
0381.00002; Over the past 12 months, the Fos upheld four complaints involving mortgages and the property scheme  -  three of which have landed on Intrinsic's doorstep.; 0
0381.00003; In all three cases, the ombudsman notes the decision was not based upon the move to invest in Harlequin  -  as this would be investment advice  -  but ruled the investment was too risky to be classed as a valid repayment method for the interest-only mortgages which were taken out to invest in the now-defunct scheme.; 0
0381.00004; Around 6,000 mainly British investors ploughed about £400m into the unregulated overseas property scheme through UK financial advisers and many released cash from their homes to fund the investment. Such consumers were hoping for 'guaranteed returns' of 10 per cent a year from luxury villas that never came as the company entered insolvency in 2016 and subsequently went bankrupt.; 1
0381.00005; The scheme is now under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office and, as a result of mis-selling, the scheme's boss is set to stand trial for three counts of fraud in 2019.; 0
0381.00006; In a Fos decision upheld in June, the ombudsman ruled clients were given unsuitable advice to take out an interest-only mortgage to fund their Harlequin investment. The couple, who the Fos called Mr and Mrs A, had met with TBG Financial Services Ltd - an appointed representative of Intrinsic - in August 2008 to discuss remortgaging their home to invest in Harlequin.; 0
0381.00007; Mr and Mrs A were advised to take out an interest-only mortgage in order to release the funds, but the ombudsman thought the investment was not a reasonable means of ensuring the mortgage was repaid.; 0
0381.00008; The ombudsman said the adviser would have been aware Harlequin was the reason Mr and Mrs A sought the new mortgage and would have known the nature of Harlequin as a risky investment. Although the ombudsman service noted the adviser was not giving investment advice, they said the adviser should have thought about how the mortgage was to be repaid and that the nature of the investment should have raised concerns as to the security of the repayment strategy. In this case, Intrinsic Mortgage Planning was ordered to pay the difference between the total cost of the interest-only mortgage and what the total cost of the repayment vehicle would have been  -  plus 8 per cent simple interest per year and £750 for trouble and upset.; 1
0381.00009; In a similar case upheld in July, the ombudsman ruled another pair of clients, dubbed Mr and Mrs H, were also unsuitably advised to borrow on an interest-only basis to invest in the scheme.; 0
0381.00010; Mr and Mrs H had also met with TBG, which provided mortgage advice regarding the funds needed to raise capital for four investments  -  one of which was Harlequin. The couple applied for an interest-only mortgage for £219,000 (£29,000 of which was used to pay a deposit on the scheme), but the ombudsman once again found the proposed repayment strategy of the overseas investment was too risky for Mr and Mrs H.

0382.00001; Over the last 6 months, we have seen a positive increase in activity on the LocalCoinSwap P2P exchange as well as achieved fantastic brand awareness within the wider crypto community.; 0
0382.00002; Although we have seen improvements in the vital statistics such as signups, trade advertisements posted, completed trades, trade completion rates, and average active user wallet balances, we have not yet reached a level of profitability due to ongoing development and operational expenses.; 0
0382.00003; As such, there will not be a dividend distribution for Q3 2019 as there is no profit to be distributed.; 0
0382.00004; With that said, we have listened to the community and heard the calling for a fixed rate of return to LCS token holders regardless of profitability.; 0
0382.00005; We have also heard the voices from the community that LCS token holders want more of a say.; 0
0382.00006; So we are excited to say that we are officially going to have our 3rd official community vote!; 0
0382.00007; Why Community Vote #3 Matters?; 0
0382.00008; The objective of this vote is to decide whether or not we transition our LCS token model from a dividend model to a buyback and burn model. Awareness of LocalCoinSwap and trust in the platform is building at a strong rate.; 0
0382.00009; As of Q3, well over $1 million of bitcoin alone has passed through users' accounts and we are trending towards a state of profitability. We want to ensure these growths of returns and future profitability are equitably passed on to LCS token holders.; 0
0382.00010; This vote will determine how LCS token holders should expect returns in times of unknown profitability, as well as decide how to strike a balance between the current dividend distribution model, and the issue of numerous transaction fees taking away from dividend returns with the upcoming non-custodial implementation.; 0
0382.00011; The community is hugely important given the underlying ethos of the LocalCoinSwap project.; 0
0382.00012; Unlike other monopolistic exchanges only looking out for their own interests, the LocalCoinSwap team does not make big decisions that may affect the long term positions of LCS holders lightly, or without consulting the community.; 0
0382.00013; This is why the voting system was conceived and implemented alongside the exchange.; 0
0382.00014; If you own LCS Cryptoshares then your vote counts! Schedule & What's Next?; 0

0387.00001; Dividend Ideas | Financials  High Yield Investing: Negative Interest Rates And mREITs With Yields +12% |  About: Annaly Capital Management, Inc.; 0
0387.00002; (NLY), Includes: AGNC, DX, NRZ  by: Rida Morwa  Rida Morwa  Research analyst, REITs, energy, Dividend income for retirees  Summary  We have received a lot of questions about what impact negative interest rates might have on mREITs.; 0
0387.00003; Lower interest rates are good for mREITs- negative interest rates would be fantastic.; 0
0387.00004; There is a lot of confusion about what is causing the current pain for mREITs, the answer is that it has more to do with the suddenness of rates declining.; 0
0387.00005; The pain from hedging losses is a one-time impact, whenever the bottom is found for treasuries, the pain stops immediately. Co-produced with Beyond Saving and PendragonY for High Dividend Opportunities  Many income investors like to get very high yields by investing in the morgtate REIT sector, or the mREIT sector.; 0
0387.00006; This is a very juicy sector with many mREITs currently yielding well over 11%. A frequent question we have been receiving from members is the theoretical impact of negative interest rates on mREITs like Annaly Capital Management (NLY), AGNC Investment Corp (AGNC) and Dynex Capital (DX).; 0
0387.00007; These are investments with very juicy yields.; 0
0387.00008; NLY currently yields +12%, AGNC yields 13%, and DX yields 12.7%.; 0
0387.00009; In our article today, we will focus on Annaly Capital (NLY), which is one of our favorite mREIT picks and how it will be impacted by lower interest rates.; 0
0387.00010; We recently wrote on NLY in a report here, explaining why NLY could double in price if we hit a recession.; 0
0387.00011; The first thing to remember is that lower interest rates are great for agency mREITs. mREITs want lower rates- the lower the better.; 0
0387.00012; Why? Borrowing costs.; 0
0387.00013; Source: NLY 10-Q  Last quarter, NLY was borrowing $105 BILLION at a weighted average rate of 2.69%.; 0
0387.00014; That is $2.82 billion in annualized interest that NLY pays.; 0
0387.00015; Suppose instead of paying 2.69%, interest rates were negative and they could borrow at -0.25%: NLY would be getting paid $262 million.; 1
0387.00016; What was once their largest expense, would suddenly become a source of profit.; 0
0387.00017; Negative interest rates do not change the nature of the yield curve.; 0
0387.00018; If we look at the German yield curve, we can see that it has become slightly inverted but is less inverted than the US yield curve. So even if we are headed for negative interest rates, it is reasonable to expect that shorter maturities will continue to usually be lower rates than longer-term maturities. In the case of Germany, mortgage interest rates remain in the 0.48%-1.64% range, even though the 30-year bonds are -0.215%.; 0
0387.00019; This is because mortgage rates always include a risk spread from the bonds. Lending money to the government is seen as lower risk than lending money to an individual. So in the case of mREITs, you would have them borrowing money at rates based on the short-end of the curve, and buying debt that was lent based on the long-end of the curve.; 0
0387.00020; If rates were negative, the mREIT could be borrowing at zero or even getting paid to borrow, while receiving a positive interest rate.; 1
0387.00021; Additionally, you would have substantial money being made on the legacy mortgages- while many would refinance, not every homeowner can or will refinance.; 0
0387.00022; They would be earning 3%+ on one hand while getting paid to borrow the funds they use to hold it. Over time, those loans would be paid off, but only after years of outsized returns.; 0
0387.00023; Lower rates means the current MBS they hold become more valuable. So Why The Losses?; 0
0387.00024; MBS prices are headed up. The MBS that mREITs were buying at the end of last year are worth substantially more today.; 0
0387.00025; Source: MBSLive  As we noted above, declining rates are great for mREITs. The reason why declining rates are painful right now is that they are declining quickly and mREITs are experiencing losses on their hedging positions as their short positions suffer larger losses than the increase in MBS prices adds.; 0
0387.00026; Source: NLY 10-Q  The problem is that mREIT have to hedge against rising interest rates.; 0
0387.00027; If they are holding 3.5% coupon MBS and interest rates went up so that new mortgages were written at 6%, their MBS would be extremely unattractive, the prices would crash and lenders would want repayment.; 0
0387.00028; That is the kind of event that could lead to significant liquidity risk.; 0
0387.00029; So to hedge against that event, mREITs enter short positions on treasuries, so if rates shoot up and the value of MBS crashes, their short positions would have large gains.; 0
0387.00030; Hedging cuts both ways, so when interest rates drop rapidly, MBS prices tend to adjust more slowly and they have a net loss. These are one time losses that are experienced with the movement, as soon as the movement stops, the losses stop.; 0
0387.00031; Even as we have more clarity on interest rates, mREITs can reduce the aggressiveness on their hedging and have smaller losses.; 0
0387.00032; So if we are headed to negative rates, mREITs will take a hit on Book Value every time we have a sudden (50 bps+) movement that MBS fails to keep up with. At 1.5%, there are fewer possible 50 bps movements possible than when we were at 3%.; 0
0387.00033; And over time, those losses will be offset by continued gains in MBS (their assets).; 0
0387.00034; The problem for MBS in 2019 has not been declining rates, it has been the speed of the decline.; 0
0387.00035; It is essentially too much of a good thing, too fast and a bit too unpredictable. That doesn't change the fact that when treasuries settle down, it is a very good thing.; 0
0387.00036; If we did eventually see negative interest rates in the US, we would be looking at a valuation and cash-flow spike like we've never seen, combined with an environment where yield is really hard to find and we could see share price skyrocket to lower the yield even as mREITs were substantially raising their dividend... the upside would be unimaginable.; 0
0387.00037; We've seen it in prior recessions where NLY was significantly raising their dividend and the price was racing up, primarily due to near-zero interest rates.; 0
0387.00038; Historically, such periods have been the ideal time to own agency MBS mREITs.; 0
0387.00039; Negative interest rates would be even better.; 0
0387.00040; Getting to the negative rates might hurt if they came quickly, but over the long-term, any losses in book value today would be more than made up for by significantly rising cash-flows and growing dividends.; 0
0387.00041; Once treasuries bottom, wherever that bottom may be, the losses stop and it is just a matter of collecting the cash-flow.; 0
0387.00042; The bottom line: Not all REITs perform the same way during rising interest rates or during declining interest rates.; 0
0387.00043; Those mREITs that did very well during rising interest rates such as New Residential Investment (NRZ) are likely to strongly under-perform as interest rates decline. The key here is to know which mREITs income investors should be investing into today, and this is exactly our objective at High Dividend Opportunities.; 0
0387.00044; We guide you on how to achieve the highest yield by investing in the right mREITs depending on the macro and micro economic conditions.; 0
0387.00045; Currently, one of our favorite picks in Anally Capital (NLY) with a yield of 12%, and which can double in price in case we hit a recession.; 1

0389.00001; IRVINE, Calif., Sept. 19, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- ATTOM Data Solutions, curator of the nation's premier property database and first property data provider of Data-as-a-Service (DaaS), today released its Q2 2019 U.S. Home Flipping Report, which shows that 59,876 U.S. single family homes and condos were flipped in the second quarter of 2019, up 12.4 percent from the previous quarter, but down 5.2 percent from a year ago.; 0
0389.00002; Click Here to View U.S. Home Flipping Trends Chart  The homes flipped in the second quarter represented 5.9 percent of all home sales during the quarter, down from a post-recession high of 7.2 percent in the previous quarter, but up from 5.4 percent a year ago.; 0
0389.00003; Homes flipped in Q2 2019 typically generated a gross profit of $62,700 (the difference between the median sale price and median paid by investors), up 2 percent from the previous quarter, but down 2 percent from a year ago.; 0
0389.00004; Click Here to View Home Flipping Profit Trends Chart  The typical gross flipping profit of $62,700 in Q2 2019 translated into a 39.9 percent return on investment compared to the original acquisition price, down from a 40.9 percent gross flipping ROI in Q1 2019 and from a margin of 44.4 percent in Q2 2018. Returns on home flips have dropped six quarters in a row and eight of the last 10, now standing at the lowest level since Q4 2011. Home flipping keeps getting less and less profitable, which is another marker that the post-recession housing boom is softening or may be coming to an end, said Todd Teta, chief product officer at ATTOM Data Solutions.; 0
0389.00005; Flipping houses is still a good business to be in and profits are healthy in most parts of the country.; 0
0389.00006; But push-and-pull forces in the housing market appear to be working less and less in investors' favor.; 0
0389.00007; That's leading to declining profits and a business that is nowhere near as good as it was a few years ago. Home flipping rate up from a year ago in 70 percent of local markets Despite the quarterly drop in home-flipping rates, 104 of 149 metropolitan statistical areas analyzed in the report (70 percent) posted a year-over-year increase in their rates in Q2 2019, including Raleigh, NC (up 72 percent) Charlotte, NC (up 54 percent) Atlanta, GA (up 46 percent) San Antonio, TX (up 46 percent) and Tucson, AZ (up 43 percent).; 0

0389.00020; Report methodology ATTOM Data Solutions analyzed sales deed data for this report. A single-family home or condo flip was any arms-length transaction that occurred in the quarter where a previous arms-length transaction on the same property had occurred within the last 12 months.; 0
0389.00021; The average gross flipping profit is the difference between the purchase price and the flipped price (not including rehab costs and other expenses incurred, which flipping veterans estimate typically run between 20 percent and 33 percent of the property's after repair value). Gross flipping return on investment was calculated by dividing the gross flipping profit by the first sale (purchase) price.

0391.00002; Blame the first guy who employed me in 1980 he taught me a lot about business and design, but one of the most valuable gifts he gave me was an appreciation of making kitchens.; 0
0391.00003; Until I started my own business in 1995, my work for kitchens never really took me into the rooms my work would furnish. In almost every case, I was working to plans drawn (often on the backs of envelopes) by others.; 0
0391.00004; After I'd built the cabinets to spec, someone picked them up and drove them away for installation.; 0
0391.00005; Beyond a dim awareness that the scribe rails I built into face frames would somehow allow the cabinets to be fitted to the walls around them, I had no inkling of what transpired at the job site.

0392.00006; Check out the secrets to success from restaurateurs that have been through everything from finding the right restaurant loan to creating the perfect menu:  1. Start With a Solid Business Plan It is crucial to develop a solid business plan that is achievable and conservative in your revenue and cost estimates  -  in our business we don't just count pennies, we count half pennies,said Jim Balis, managing director of the strategic operations group at CapitalSpring and owner of LuLu's Pizza in Boise, Idaho. Start with understanding the cost of each plate served to a customer down to the garnish.; 0
0392.00007; [Make] sure your food is priced sufficiently so you can make a profit  -  25 percent to 30 percent of your revenue is a good number to use for 'cost of goods sold.' Your labor or staffing costs should also be appropriate to deliver good service but protect profitability  -  all-in labor with payroll taxes and benefits should be around 30 percent of revenue. Your rent should be 6 percent or less of revenue.; 0

0394.00001; USA China Trade War - Who Will Have the Last Laugh?; 0
0394.00002; By: In:  China's central bank rarely intervenes directly in foreign exchange markets, but usually operates through state-owned banks, in addition to using money market operations and its hefty foreign exchange reserves.; 0
0394.00003; by N.S.Venkataraman  A detailed and well researched book analysing the USA  -  China trade conflict and assessing who will blink first has been authored by Swaminathan Venkataraman,(swaminathan.v@nandinichemical.com) Director, Nandini Consultancy (S) Pte. The book is published by Nandini Consultancy Centre, India (nsvenkatchennai@gmail.com)  Excerpts from this interesting book read as follows  USA fears China overtaking it  China, especially under Deng Xiaoping, managed to make USA believe that it would gain if it would allow China to grow.; 0
0394.00004; Once China exceeded the US's GDP in 2015 and Donald Trump became US President, view of USA changed.; 0
0394.00005; USA now sees China as threat to its global supremacy.; 0
0394.00006; USA wants to prevent China at any cost from out beating USA in the global context.; 0
0394.00007; Has China forced the trade war ?; 0
0394.00008; China claims that it is not responsible for the trade war and it has been only pursuing the normal and well accepted trading practices.; 0
0394.00009; China says that it's exports to USA have substantially increased because US consumers found it attractive to buy the Chinese products. China further says that US President Trump is unable to persuade the US consumers not to buy products from China and therefore, he is trying to artificially increase the landed price of Chinese products by disproportionately increasing the import tariffs, to dissuade US consumers from buying the Chinese products.; 0
0394.00010; China terms such practice as unacceptable and contrary to the world marketing tradition and practices. In several observations and comments, China has expressed it's outrage at the unfolding events of trade war and the determination of US President to show China it's place.; 0
0394.00011; Accusing the US of trade bullying practices, China has said that such tactics would not work on China. China says that USA too would suffer severely due to the counter productive trade war.; 0
0394.00012; China pointed out that USA stock market has declined sharply after the commencement of trade war. Has USA imposed trade war ?; 0
0394.00013; USA says that it has not imposed any trade war on China but only selectively imposed additional tariffs on products that USA imports from China.; 0
0394.00014; It is doing so, only to protect the interests of the US economy and industry, which is a legitimate objective.; 0
0394.00015; USA further accuses China of dishonest practices like stealing technology from USA, currency manipulation, spying in USA by sending Chinese students to US universities etc. The U.S. government says that its decision to label China as currency manipulator came, after China allowed the yuan to weaken past the symbolic 7-per-dollar level.; 0
0394.00016; This has raised questions about how tightly managed the Chinese currency is and its true value. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) allows the yuan to trade in a 2% range around a mid-point that it fixes against the dollar each day. That mid-point is based on the yuan's movement in the previous session and moves in currencies of China's main trading partners.; 0
0394.00017; China's central bank rarely intervenes directly in foreign exchange markets, but usually operates through state-owned banks, in addition to using money market operations and its hefty foreign exchange reserves.; 0
0394.00018; The PBOC is also believed to influence offshore markets in various ways, including scheduled and off-cycle sales of yuan-denominated bills in Hong Kong, which traders say can soak up liquidity and stem speculative short-selling of the currency. Level of trade between USA and China  In 2018, China was the largest goods trading partner of USA, with two way trade totaling 659.8 billion USD.; 0
0394.00019; Goods exports from USA totaled 120.3 billion USD and imports totaled 539.5 billion USD. US goods trade deficit with China was 419.2 billion USD. Trade in services with China (exports and imports) totaled an estimated 72.3 billion USD in 2018.; 0
0394.00020; (Source : US Government website)  Will the two countries reconcile?; 0
0394.00021; In the past, both China and USA, have demonstrated the capacity for pulling back from the brink.; 0
0394.00022; However, it is doubtful whether it would be possible at the present time, with USA seem to be determined to teach China a lesson and not lose in global supremacy status and China determined not to give up it's ambition for global supremacy.; 0
0394.00023; China's investment in emerging technologies  China is rapidly emerging as a technology superpower.; 0
0394.00024; This will have far-reaching implications for the world  China has invested billions of dollars in recent years to develop the civilian and military applications of emerging technologies such as 5G, semiconductors, microchips, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing and others to transform China from an assembly line of low tech manufactured goods into the pre eminent economic and technological power, manufacturing high tech goods.; 0
0394.00025; China has made an early start in setting up the 5G infrastructure and decided to roll out this technology from 2020, the second country after South Korea.; 0
0394.00026; In AI, China has progressed in facial and image recognition, manufacturing drones and robots On the military side, China is researching air, land, sea and undersea autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles, which can assist in reconnaissance and attacks on enemy aircraft and vessels.; 0
0394.00027; China's army is trying to use advances in quantum radar and sensing to gain advantages in stealth technology. Its navy is trying to develop a quantum compass for its submarines, which would not require satellite based navigation.; 0
0394.00028; Though China has made impressive progress in exploiting several technology applications, claims being made in some international media that China will be the world leader in these technologies in a few years, appears to be exaggerated and premature.; 0
0394.00029; Large Chinese investments have not always translated into technological successes adequately so far.; 0
0394.00030; Since the 1990s, China has made numerous efforts to design and fabricate its own chips investing billions of dollars in several companies but mostly not succeeded. China imports about 80% of its microchip requirement. In 2017, it spent $260 billion on imports of semiconductors and chips, more than its imports of crude oil.; 1
0394.00031; China is aggressively continuing with its chip making efforts trying to acquire foreign technologies through outright purchase, joint venture, stealth and local innovation It is believed that China will take several years to reach the current levels of chip specialisation in the West.; 0
0394.00032; In AI, lot of credit for China's successes goes to American and other non-Chinese researchers and companies. According to a Tsinghua University study, more than half of China's AI papers were international joint publications.; 0
0394.00033; All the software development of Chinese drone maker DJI is performed at DJI's American office.; 0
0394.00034; China's strength is mainly in AI applications and it still has a long way to go in core technologies of AI, such as hardware and algorithm development. In quantum computing also, many problems remain unresolved such as mastering materials use, quantum chip design and manufacturing Also the development of a functional quantum computer remains several years away.; 0
0394.00035; From here on, progress in these technologies will be slowed down by a number of factors.; 0
0394.00036; The US has started denying access to leading Chinese companies in its market, imposed restraints on Chinese students studying robotics, aerospace, semiconductors and quantum computing in US universities, and is urging its allies and friends not to allow Chinese companies in their countries for national security reasons  Visible impact of tariff war on China  The toll of US tariffs on China's export and consequently Chinese economy is becoming more visible.; 0
0394.00037; Although exports to USA account for just a small share of overall GDP of China, the uncertainty has bruised corporate confidence.; 0
0394.00038; Factory prices in China have veered into deflation, a bad sign for industrial profits.; 0
0394.00039; For example, a quarter of the Chinese production capacity used by global sportswear brands is lying idle, according to an industry source, as the trade war pushes the biggest labels out of the Chinese factories.; 1
0394.00040; The exodus is forcing plants to offer discounts of 10% to local companies like Xtep International Holdings Ltd.; 1
0394.00041; The sportswear label, based in the southern province of Fujian, is one of a handful of Chinese brands competing with the likes of Nike Inc. and Adidas AG.; 0
0394.00042; Idle capacity in a country that is long been the workshop to the world underscores the blow of the trade war imposed on Chinese manufacturers, who are also grappling with an economy that is expanding at its slowest pace in three decades.; 0
0394.00043; There are growing signs that the global supply chain that has been in place for decades -- and powered by China's economic rise -- is being transformed.; 0
0394.00044; Economists at Morgan Stanley, a bank, now forecast that Chinese growth will fall to 5.8% in 2020 previously they had expected 6.3%. (This forecast is conditional on the new American tariffs being implemented and lasting for four to six months.; 1
0394.00045; If not, the bank expects growth of 6% in 2020.); 0
0394.00046; In the past, whenever growth looked set to slow sharply, Chinese companies could count on a stimulus package from Government of China to revive it. But this time, Government of China have been much more restrained in its response, partly because of concern about adding to China's hefty debt burden.; 0
0394.00047; In August, 2019, the central bank in China had a chance to lower funding costs for banks, but it refrained.; 0
0394.00048; Aggressive approach of US  Trade conflict with the US is a new and important sustainability challenge for China. There is no doubt that the USA is pursuing a containment strategy vis-à-vis China.; 0
0394.00049; From an ever-escalating tariff war and tough trade policy by blacklisting leading Chinese technology companies and to US Vice-President Mike Pence's declaration of a new cold war, the US political establishment has swung dramatically from viewing China as an opportunity to regarding it as an existential threat. China's restrained approach  China indicated that it would not immediately retaliate against the latest U.S. tariff increase in equal measure, emphasizing the need to discuss ways to de escalate the trade war between the world's two largest economies. China has ample means for retaliation, but thinks the question that should be discussed now is about removing the new tariffs to prevent escalation of the trade war, Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng told reporters in China  In the month of September 2019, China has spared some US goods from extra tariff.; 0
0394.00050; Exemptions apply to the round of tariffs China imposed on US goods starting last July in retaliation for higher US levies.; 0
0394.00051; China announced a range of US goods to be exempted from 25 percent extra tariffs put in place earlier, as China seeks to ease the impact from the trade war without lifting charges on major agricultural items such as soybeans and pork.; 1
0394.00052; Pharmaceuticals and lubricant oil are among exclusions to levies on imports announced by the Ministry of Finance on its website  Further rounds of Chinese exemptions will be announced in due course, the ministry said.; 0
0394.00053; Resilience of Chinese economy and tenacity of Government of China  Chinese economy is huge  -  13.6 million US$ - 13.2 times the size that was in 1998. Annual economic growth rate of around 6.2% largely remain on track. While it may marginally fall in the light of the trade war, it is unlikely to go down to alarmingly low level in view of Chinese internal resilience.; 0
0394.00054; It will be unrealistic for USA to expect that China will fundamentally change its economic model even in the medium term.; 0
0394.00055; Since 2009, China has been trying hard to rejig its export dependent economy to the one more dependent on domestic consumption to halt the slowdown. In China, domestic consumption is poised to play a bigger role in driving economic growth, as it contributes around 60 percent to the economic expansion in the recent months, which Chinese officials consider to be encouraging. The fact remains that China has come a long way, being able to deal with challenges that come on it's way.; 0
0394.00056; Who will have the last laugh?; 0
0394.00057; With the presidential election in USA not far away, change in approach of USA is possible. However, the basic fact that USA would not like to surrender its world supremacy status to China, will persist and continue whoever may be the next President of USA after election  China has totalitarian regime with the present President of China considering himself to be a life long president.; 0
0394.00058; However, unlike USA, there is no transparency in Chinese governance and politics. In totalitarian regime, it may well be possible that a new president may forcibly take over, in the event of social unrest and economic slow down and conflicts taking place. It is not possible all the time to suppress dissent, even in the totalitarian regime .; 0
0394.00059; Things may change in the China too and new leadership may take over in future. One never know. Considering the strength and weakness of USA and China and the ground reality that both these countries have to necessarily play a mutually beneficial role in the long run to sustain their own economies, one may tend to wonder at this stage as to who will have the last laugh.; 0
0394.00060; As on today, looking at the overall scenario and taking a holistic view, it appears that China is in a weaker stage compared to USA, as China still needs time to go up to a higher level to effectively challenge USA to reach world supremacy.Therefore, it is likely that China will bend a little more and yield to the US pressure to some extent and seek compromise. But, the subtle trade war in various forms will continue.; 0
0394.00061; The world will not see the end of trade war too soon.; 0
0394.00062; World is watching without clue  The world is watching how China and USA will deal with their trade issues. How they do so could well determine the future of global trade relations and overall global geo political scenario.; 0

0395.00002; Photographer: Gabby Jones/Bloomberg  Madewell filed for an initial public offering on Friday afternoon, setting the stage for its anticipated split from struggling parent company J.Crew.; 0
0395.00003; J.Crew had first hinted at an IPO in April, saying that a spin-off of its fast-growing women's brand would help it to maximize shareholder value and reduce its own enormous debt load. On Friday, the retailer submitted paperwork to the Securities & Exchange Commission, saying it plans to raise $100 million in the offering.; 0
0395.00004; However, this is a placeholder and is likely to change.; 0
0395.00005; Madewell was launched by J.Crew in 2006 as a separate brand and is particularly known for its denim.; 0
0395.00006; In recent years, it has enjoyed breakneck growth and popularity among young female shoppers, at a time when J.Crew has struggled with declining sales, turnover in the C-suite and a brand identity crisis. In 2018, Madewell's revenues grew by 32% to $614 million, according to a filing. The company is also profitable, recording net income of $60 million last year, up from $45 million in 2017 and $12 million in 2016.; 1
0395.00007; The company primarily sells its apparel, shoes and accessories online and in its own stores. E-commerce currently makes up 40% of its direct-to-consumer business, although the company has said it would like to get this over half. Madewell also has a growing wholesale channel.; 0
0395.00008; It began selling its items at retailers like Nordstrom, Stitch Fix and Net-a-Porter in 2015 and, last year, that business brought in some 13% of its revenues.; 0
0395.00009; Madewell's CEO Libby Wadle, 46, will continue to lead the company after it goes public.; 0
0395.00010; She has been at J.Crew since 2004, was part of the team that launched Madewell in 2006 and was named its first-ever CEO earlier this year.; 0
0395.00011; What will change?; 0
0395.00012; In some ways, we will continue on as we have - growing organically and authentically, with our customers at the center of every decision we make, wrote Wadle in a letter to investors, published on Friday. But we will also focus on considerable growth through new opportunities, including driving outsized growth in e-commerce, expanding our product range and further developing our membership program. While J.Crew had its own stint on the public markets, it has been private since 2011, when TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners conducted a $3 billion leveraged buyout.; 0

In its edition dated September 13, TOI had reported that the UP treasury had been paying income tax of all chief ministers and ministers since 1981, when the UP Ministers' Salaries, Allowances and Miscellaneous Act, 1981 was passed during the tenure of V P Singh on the grounds that the ministers were poor and cannot pay income tax from their own meagre earnings.

0398.00001; John Ivison: Andrew Scheer lacks sizzle, but that may be just what voters want Canadians are now faced with a choice for prime minister between a dreamer who tends to disappoint and a more pedestrian but predictable pretender  John Ivison  Updated: September 16, 2019  Federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and his wife Jill leave a campaign event in Surrey, B.C. Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press  Share Adjust Comment Print  PARKSVILLE, B.C.  -  Feet were tapping and snowy heads nodding, as Cracklin' Rosie blasted over the PA system in a packed auditorium. This was verdant pasture for any Conservative leader  -  the jewel of Vancouver Island, where eagles nest and Canadians come to retire.; 0
0398.00002; The room was full of what one of my millennial colleagues rather ungraciously referred to as cotton-tops.; 0
0398.00003; They cheered enthusiastically for local businessman Byron Horner, the Conservative leader's warm-up act and the candidate in the riding of Courtenay-Alberni that was lost to the NDP in 2015. It's only 36 days until Andrew Scheer is elected prime minister, he said.; 0
0398.00004; The response was good-natured and courteous but lacked conviction, as if the audience did not really believe that the affable, modest, decent man in front of them has the royal jelly needed to lead and inspire. The problem with electoral politics is that no-one really knows what turns a worker into a queen bee and it is often too late when voters discover their preferred candidate is not equipped for the office.; 0
0398.00005; But Scheer's lack of sizzle may work in his favour.; 0
0398.00006; The Conservatives have placed all their money on black  -  as in families and governments being in the black. Scheer frames the election as a stark choice: This is about your future. Will this be a country where you struggle to get by, or a country where life is affordable.; 0
0398.00007; That's what this federal election will come down to.; 0
0398.00008; He runs the risk of being branded a one-trick pony.; 0
0398.00009; The repertoire for this particular circus horse has, thus far, been limited to tax cuts and credits, while broader issues like climate change, housing and healthcare have been barely mentioned.; 0
0398.00010; But it may prove that the cost of living is the overwhelming concern of voters and carries this most self-effacing of politicians to power.; 0
0398.00011; On Sunday in Surrey, British Columbia, Scheer unveiled a central plank of his platform  -  the universal tax cut that will reduce the lowest tax bracket from 15 per cent to 13.75 per cent. The Conservatives say the average individual will save $444 a year, though some experts suggest the amount will be less. Regardless, its scope means it's costly  -  up to $7 billion a year when fully implemented, according to the Parliamentary Budget Office.; 1
0398.00012; Scheer has already announced other measures designed to reduce the cost of living  -  taking the tax off home heating bills, making maternity benefits tax free, restoring a Harper-era public transit credit and, of course, cancelling the carbon tax (a measure that received wild applause in Parksville, even though its repeal wouldn't affect B.C., which has its own carbon pricing scheme).; 0
0398.00013; The repertoire for this particular circus horse has, thus far, been limited to tax cuts and credits  Scheer went back to the future again on Monday, announcing in Lake Country, B.C., that a Conservative government would bring back the children's tax credits for sports and arts.; 0
0398.00014; The broad-based tax cut has been well-received as the most efficient way to put money in the hands of all taxpayers.; 0
0398.00015; There will be whinging about the restoration of boutique credits that complicate the tax code.; 0
0398.00016; Scheer's justification is that 80 per cent of middle-class families pay more tax than four years ago  -  a figment of his imagination based on a Fraser Institute study that somehow omitted to include the $22 billion the government transfers to families through Canada Child Benefit. But there is no doubt the cumulative effect of the Scheer package would be to increase the disposable income of families struggling with rising prices. Amidst the artifice and phoniness of the campaign, Scheer hosted a roundtable of voters (presumably Conservative voters) that introduced some authenticity to the proceedings.; 0
0398.00017; Regardless of their affiliation, the stories rang true. One man talked about the stress on the family finances that forced him to take a second job to help put his four kids through school.; 0

0399.00001; Tax experts dismissed the argument that the tax would violate either the U.S. Constitution's Commerce Clause or the Wyoming State Constitution's Uniformity Clause. Opponents of a proposed Wyoming corporate income tax say it's unconstitutional. They're wrong.; 0
0399.00002; /in Education Funding, Tax Reform, Uncategorized /by BetterWyoming  If you've lived in Wyoming over the past 30 years you've seen Walmart come to your town or a town near you while Main Street shops close up. This is part of a larger national trend of corporations replacing local businesses.; 0
0399.00003; These corporations generate profits from local sales and send the money out of communities, back to corporate headquarters and shareholders. Most states address this situation with a corporate income tax. This way, they can capture a portion of corporate profits to help pay for public services and infrastructure - after all, big chain stores expect the communities where they do business to have fire departments, streets, police, hospitals, and schools.; 0
0399.00004; Wyoming is one of only two states nationwide that doesn't have any form of corporate tax.; 0
0399.00005; A new proposed bill would change that.; 0
0399.00006; The National Corporate Profit Recapture Act would impose an income tax on corporations with more than 100 shareholders that operate in Wyoming.; 0
0399.00007; The bill would tax big companies like Walmart, Applebee's, Home Depot, FedEx, and other national and global chains, while sparing Mom and Pop shops any increased tax burden. It would generate tens of millions of dollars per year, which would be allocated to the state's education budget.; 0
0399.00008; A bogus argument  Taxing Walmart to help pay for Wyoming schools seems like it would be a pretty popular idea, even in our notoriously anti-tax Legislature.; 0
0399.00009; And, indeed, a similar proposal had broad support last legislative session. But was narrowly defeated. The new and improved version of the bill, which the Legislature's Joint Revenue Committee will consider on Sept. 19, also has its detractors.; 0
0399.00010; Some are simply no-tax-ever, taxation-is-theft, right-wing zealots like Sen. Bo Biteman (R-Ranchester), who is more than happy to admit he'd rather defund Wyoming schools than tax Walmart.; 0
0399.00011; Unconstitutional is a pretty intimidating term, especially when it's in an accusation leveled by a state lawmaker.; 0
0399.00012; But others aren't so keen to admit where their loyalties lie.; 0
0399.00013; These lawmakers don't want to go on record supporting a tax, because doing so would threaten their politically precious conservative credentials.; 0
0399.00014; But neither do they want to support protecting corporate profits over commonsense tax reform. Affie Ellis (R-Cheyenne), have found what they think is a safer line of attack: They're claiming that the National Corporate Profit Recapture Act is unconstitutional because it unfairly targets out-of-state businesses.; 0
0399.00015; Unconstitutional is a pretty intimidating term, especially when it's in an accusation leveled by a state lawmaker.; 0
0399.00016; But in this case, the term should be harmless.; 0
0399.00017; Because the argument is bogus. The experts  Michael Mazerov admits he was concerned when he first read a draft of the National Corporate Profit Recapture Act.; 0
0399.00018; The senior fellow at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities is one of the nation's top experts on state taxes.; 0
0399.00019; He thought the proposed Wyoming corporate income tax might violate the U.S. Constitution's Commerce Clause.; 0
0399.00020; The problem, Mazerov thought, dealt with Wyoming's unique constitutional provision that says if the state ever implements an income tax - personal, corporate, or otherwise - taxpayers would automatically receive a credit for the sales and property taxes they already paid. The court will rule against a tax that obviously discriminates against out-of-state corporations, Mazerov said.; 0
0399.00021; This proposal doesn't. Since out-of-state companies would presumably pay less in sales and property taxes than Wyoming-based companies, they would receive less of a credit.; 0
0399.00022; As a result, the law would be biased against out-of-state companies. On further consideration, however, Mazerov realized that his initial impression was wrong.; 0
0399.00023; He explained to Better Wyoming that the formula the proposed tax would use to determine how much a company owes would balance out any bias against out-of-state companies.; 0
0399.00024; Called the apportionment formula, it would tax companies according to how much of their total property and payroll is in Wyoming. For instance, a huge out-of-state corporation like Walmart has only a tiny fraction of its property and payroll in Wyoming, so a tiny fragment of its profits would be taxed. A Wyoming-based company with more than 100 shareholders, however, would have a far greater share of its profits subject to the tax.; 0
0399.00025; In this manner, the proposal balances out the way it would affect in- and out-of-state corporations.; 0
0399.00026; Keep in mind that all this is mostly hypothetical, since there are no Wyoming-based corporations with more than 100 shareholders. The court will rule against a tax that obviously discriminates against out-of-state corporations, Mazerov said.; 0
0399.00027; This [proposal] doesn't. The lobbyist  The Wyoming Supreme Court has struck down a tax in the past for being unconstitutional. In 1987, it ruled that a property tax passed by the Legislature violated the state constitution's uniformity clause.; 0
0399.00028; The problem, the court ruled, was that the tax treated different classes of taxpayers in different ways.; 0
0399.00029; During the 2019 legislative session, a lobbyist from the law firm Holland and Hart brought up this case in order to argue against the previous proposed income tax. Commonly called the Big Box Tax, it also targeted corporations with more than 100 shareholders, but only those within the retail, hospitality, and food service industries.; 0
0399.00030; The lobbyist, Walter Eggers, is an attorney for the mineral industries.; 0
0399.00031; He told a Senate committee that the proposed Big Box Tax raised uniformity clause concerns because it treated different classes of corporations - i.e., those with more than 100 shareholders and those in the three specific industries - differently. When he recently spoke with Better Wyoming, Eggers said that he had not been following the new version of the corporate income tax, but he said that its constitutionality may depend on whether it had resolved these uniformity issues.; 0
0399.00032; Income tax law is not property tax law  It turns out, however, that Eggers is probably wrong.; 0
0399.00033; Phil Horwitz is a professor of state tax law at Denver University and an attorney at the firm Moss Adams.; 0
0399.00034; Prior to that, he was the Director of Tax Policy Analysis for the Colorado Department of Revenue.; 0
0399.00035; He has been working in state tax law for 25 years.; 0
0399.00036; Uniformity clauses almost without exception apply to ad valorem, or property, taxes, and not income taxes.; 0
0399.00037; Horwitz told Better Wyoming that most states have both uniformity clauses in their constitutions and corporate income taxes that treat different classes of companies differently. That's because uniformity clauses almost without exception apply to ad valorem, or property, taxes, and not income taxes. There is very little precedent, he said, to suggest that an income tax would run afoul of a uniformity clause.; 0
0399.00038; An income tax might be unconstitutional, Horwitz said, if it treated different companies within a single class differently. But the proposed National Corporate Profit Recapture Act would create a single class - made up of companies with more than 100 shareholders - and treat all of those companies the same. The 1987 case that Eggers brought up showed that the Wyoming Supreme Court is willing to strike down a tax, Horwitz said, but that dealt with property tax.; 0
0399.00039; The rules for income tax are different, he said. The claim  In an email to one of her constituents, Sen.; 0
0399.00040; Affie Ellis wrote that she opposed the National Corporate Recapture Act because she thought it was unconstitutional.; 0
0399.00041; Affie Ellis  In the email, which was forwarded to Better Wyoming, Ellis wrote that she has significant concerns about the constitutionality of the proposal both under the Wyoming Constitution and the United States Constitution. Legislation cannot single-out or discriminate against out-of-state corporations in my view, the 100 or more shareholder requirement contained in these bills does just that.; 0
0399.00042; If taken to court, I believe that this provision would violate the federal Commerce Clause and its Wyoming corollary. Ellis is also an attorney at Holland and Hart, alongside Walter Eggers, the lobbyists who brought up the constitutionality question in the first place. Ducking the real arguments  As Mazerov and Horwitz - people who have spent their professional lives working with state tax policy - explained, however, Ellis' and Eggers' claims are unfounded.; 0
0399.00043; Mazerov said it's also worth noting that none of the tax experts from conservative organizations opposing the proposal, like the Tax Foundation, are questioning it on constitutional grounds. This is despite the fact that the Tax Foundation's Jared Walczak has written about the corporate tax proposals repeatedly, and even flew to Cheyenne to testify in July before the Joint Revenue Committee.; 0
0399.00044; When people start to make really weird technical arguments, it's because they can't make the big arguments without exposing the true nature of what they're protecting.; 0
0399.00045; Ali Mickelson, the director of legislative and tax policy at the Colorado Fiscal Institute, likewise disagreed that the Corporate Profit Recapture Act would have any constitutional problems as a result of its targeting companies with more than 100 shareholders. In fact, she told Better Wyoming, it's fairly common for state taxes to specifically target Big Business.; 0
0399.00046; For instance, Colorado recently amended a tax break that retailers receive in a way that raised taxes for the richest 2 percent of companies operating in Colorado. Meanwhile, it spared or decreased taxes for the other 98 percent of companies, while raising up to $50 million a year for low-income housing.; 0
0399.00047; Mickelson said that she grows suspicious when lawmakers start trotting out questions of constitutionality or other esoteric legal claims instead of addressing issues head-on.; 0
0399.00048; She said it often means lawmakers have something to hide.; 0
0399.00049; When people start to make really weird technical arguments, it's because they can't make the big arguments without exposing the true nature of what they're protecting, Mickelson said.; 0
0399.00050; So, instead of simply saying they're afraid to support a tax that would have Walmart pay their fair share to fund Wyoming schools, Wyoming legislators are hiding behind bogus constitutionality claims.; 0
0399.00051; But ask any tax expert, from any part of the political spectrum, whether this argument holds water and you'll get the same dismissive response. We'll see whether expertise or fear-mongering will prevail when the Joint Revenue Committee meets on Sept. 19.  Naysayers who don't want to admit they support Walmart over Wyoming schools are using a bogus technical argument.Tags: affie ellis, budget, center for budget and policy priorities, colorado fiscal institute, commerce clause, corporate income tax, education, taxes, uniformity, wyoming  Climate change creeps into Wyo Legislature tax reform talks  As state money for special education dries up, Wyoming looks to Medicaid  Wyoming lawmakers have a cultural bias against accepting federal funds  Rod Miller explains Wyoming coal's long, slow death [VIDEO]  Federal regulations created Wyoming's coal industry  Proposal would help stop corporations from sucking profits out of Wyoming  BetterWyoming; 0

0404.00001; 'It's too hard to verify child benefit claims older than three months': Critics slam 'absurd' government stance condemning many mums to a poorer retirement By Tanya Jefferies for Thisismoney.co.uk 08:00 17 Sep 2019, updated 18:09 17 Sep 2019  {{#first?}}; 0

0404.00003; {{{articleHeadline}}}  This is Money is campaigning against the unfairness of parents ending up worse off in retirement over innocent child benefit mistakes Gaynor Seymour has lost two and a half years of state pension credits These could be worth around £12,500 over a typical 20-year retirement Credits are only backdated for three months when child benefit is claimed late Government claims it's too hard to verify parents were responsible for a child further back than that - read its full response below Have you lost state pension by not signing up for child benefits or filling form in wrong? Our contact details are below  Lost credits: Gaynor Seymour, pictured with husband Andrew, says she can easily prove she looked after her daughter in the disputed period  A mum who lost valuable state pension credits over an innocent paperwork blunder says she can easily prove she looked after her daughter during the disputed period.; 0
0404.00004; ADVERTISEMENT  The Government claims it's too hard to verify evidence for child benefit claims older than three months, as entitlement relies on being responsible for a child each week, and so credits are never backdated further than that. This stance is dubbed 'ludicrous' and 'a nonsense' by critics, who believe in the majority of cases it will be obvious parents were in charge of their children at the times in question.; 0
0404.00005; This is Money is campaigning against the unfairness of parents - mostly mums - potentially ending up tens of thousands of pounds worse off in retirement due to errors over child benefit forms. We are calling for full backdating of state pension credits for those who claim child benefit late, a common occurrence after a confusing rule change in 2013.; 0
0404.00006; In response, the Government has highlighted its efforts to raise awareness of the importance of claiming child benefit and defended the three-month credit backdating rule as 'a fair and reasonable time' - see below.; 0
0404.00007; Gaynor Seymour, 44, pictured with husband Andrew, has lost two and a half years of state pension credits, which could be worth around £12,500 over the course of a typical 20-year retirement.; 0
0404.00008; She was unaware her state pension might be affected if she didn't claim child benefit, even though her family doesn't qualify to receive the payments.; 0
0404.00009; 'Despite my only earning between £6-10,000 a year for the past three years since having a baby my husband earns considerably more which meant it wasn't worth claiming for benefits as he would simply pay it back in tax,' she says.; 0
0404.00010; Why are parents losing state pension credits?; 0
0404.00011; A controversial overhaul of child benefit in 2013 reduced the entitlement for those earning £50,000-plus a year or wiped it out entirely for those earning £60,000-plus - something officially known as the High Income Child Benefit Charge.; 1
0404.00012; But parents who earn too much to qualify for child benefit still have to apply for it so that they receive state pension credits.; 0
0404.00013; People who earn less and do qualify for child benefit are also losing state pension because it is easy to make a mistake. A common problem is when the 'wrong' partner signs up for child benefit, because they are working so the credits are worthless to them.; 0
0404.00014; However, couples can apply to HMRC to swap credits between them - find out how to do this here.; 0
0404.00015; The full state pension is £168.60 a week, or around £8,800 a year. Each credit is worth 1/35 of the value of the state pension  -  around £251 per year or £5,020 over the course of a typical 20-year retirement.; 0
0404.00016; 'So I decided not to bother and my husband just put the money into an account from his earnings.'; 0
0404.00017; ADVERTISEMENT  Mrs Seymour says she has plenty of evidence proving she was responsible for her daughter since her birth in January 2016, if the Government was willing to backdate her credits beyond three months.; 0
0404.00018; She has correspondence with her employer about maternity leave and with the family's GP, records from her daughter's nursery, and records of attendance at baby and toddler care sessions and swimming lessons.; 0
0404.00019; The former legal secretary is worried she might not manage to make up lost credits with future qualifying years of National Insurance contributions.; 0
0404.00020; She is low paid despite juggling several jobs in addition to caring for her young daughter - she is a dogwalker, and qualified in sports massage.; 0
0404.00021; Parents can register for child benefit but opt out of the actual payments, if they don't qualify due to high earnings but need the credits. But Mrs Seymour says the form was not clear enough about this, or that failure to claim meant she could end up with a lower state pension.; 0
0404.00022; HMRC recently overhauled the form, which is handed out in Bounty Packs to new parents, and says it is continuously considering ways communications can be improved further. What do pension experts say?; 0
0404.00023; 'This limited timeframe is absurd' 'A sleep deprived overwhelmed new parent is presented with reams of new responsibility and information,' says Jon Greer, head of retirement policy at Quilter. 'There will be numerous things on their mind, but what isn't likely to be one of them is their state pension. In fact that's unlikely to cross their mind until they come up for air, which could take months.; 0
0404.00024; 'And yet the Government is claiming that three months leeway on appropriately filling out a child benefit form is enough.; 0
0404.00025; What does the Government say about backdating credits?; 0
0404.00026; 'Where no one has claimed child benefit, the Government allows claims to be backdated three months.; 0
0404.00027; 'A more generous backdating would make it harder to verify evidence and establish entitlement since entitlement to child benefit relies upon being responsible for a child each week.; 0
0404.00028; 'For this reason, the government believes that the three-month backdating period for child benefit (and the accompanying NI credit) is a fair and reasonable time in which to allow those wishing to claim child benefit to do so.' 'This limited timeframe is even more absurd when you consider that parents who are subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge, and therefore don't need to claim child benefit, still need to fill out the form so they can get NI credits.; 0
0404.00029; ADVERTISEMENT  'More than that it means that people who didn't initially realise the step change that came in when new rules were introduced in 2013, will only get three months back despite being a parent for over six years.' Mr Greer says the Government's rationale for not allowing more generous backdating is they cannot reasonably work out if someone was entitled for periods going back more than three months, but punishing parents in favour of the ease of administration seems perverse.; 0
0404.00030; 'Whilst there may be some cases where the family history is more complex surely this seems a ludicrous position to take for the majority of parents for whom it is obvious they were responsible for their child during the period of entitlement to NI credits.; 0
0404.00031; 'It seems clear that the ease of administration is taking precedent over the implications for parents. 'Surely it would be more sensible to be clear on the evidence criteria that parents would have to provide and where they could not provide it entitlement would not be given for a particular period. 'This is a simple fix that would be a quick win for a Government that sorely needs just that.'; 0
0404.00032; Jon Greer: 'People who didn¿t initially realise the step change when new rules were introduced in 2013 will only get three months back despite being a parent for over six years'  Former Pensions Minister Steve Webb, now policy director at Royal London, launched a petition on behalf of mums facing a reduced state pension in old age, calling for them to be handed back lost credits.; 0
0404.00033; Because it topped 10,000 signatures the Government had to respond, and it argued that it was too hard to verify child benefit claims older than three months. Webb answered at the time: 'The rigid response on three-month backdating is absurd - the idea that if someone claims for child benefit from last summer HMRC can't reasonably work out if they were entitled or not is a nonsense.; 0
0404.00034; 'It is also worth noting that HMRC allows full backdating going back to 2011 for grandparents to claim state pension credits - although this involves transfers from parents.; 0
0404.00035; 'Credit transfers for grandparents were introduced in 2011, so the Government is effectively backdating to when the scheme came in.; 0
0404.00036; 'But proving that a grandparent was looking after a child back in 2011 is a lot harder than proving you were entitled to child benefit in 2017.; 0
0404.00037; 'I suppose the Government could argue that in one case you are simply transferring an existing entitlement whereas in the other you are establishing a new entitlement, but it's a pretty thin distinction.'; 0
0404.00038; What does HMRC say?; 0
0404.00039; 'We have recently improved child benefit forms' Mrs Seymour's NI records currently show she has 22 qualifying years out of 35 needed to get a full state pension, according to the taxman. She reaches state pension age in 2042, so she has a further 23 years to gain the remaining ones she may require, it adds.; 0
0404.00040; Have you lost state pension by not signing up for child benefits or filling form in wrong?; 0
0404.00041; If this has happened to you, contact tanya.jefferies@thisismoney.co.uk and tell us your story.; 0
0404.00042; An HMRC spokesperson says: 'To ensure no one misses out on their full state pension entitlement, HMRC has always urged families to claim child benefit, even households liable to the High Income Child Benefit Charge (HICBC).; 0
0404.00043; 'The child benefit claim form  -  which is included in Bounty Packs given to families after the birth of a child  -  stresses the importance of this information.; 0
0404.00044; 'However, we are continuously considering ways in which communications can be improved further, both at the birth of a child and for existing child benefit claimants. 'We have therefore recently improved child benefit forms, guidance and communications, so that it better sets out the options to claim Child Benefit but elect not to receive payments. 'HMRC's child benefit backdating policy is consistent with the Government's longstanding approach to welfare.; 0
0404.00045; We are committed to ensuring that backdating is available to protect vulnerable claimants who may be delayed in claiming through no fault of their own.; 0
0404.00046; 'We acknowledge that some potential child benefit claimants have delayed claiming their awards, or have not done so at all. The Government has recognised that more can be done to improve claimant awareness. Child benefit: Government claims it's too hard to verify evidence for claims older than three months, as entitlement relies on being responsible for a child each week  'In April this year, we made changes to the child benefit claim form, guidance and communications, to further emphasise the options available regarding claiming child benefit and the importance of making a claim to accrue National Insurance credits to protect your state pension.; 0
0404.00047; In addition, child benefit backdating is already more generous than tax credits and universal credit, and the Government therefore believes three months is a fair and reasonable time to allow people to claim child benefit.; 0
0404.00048; 'Where no one has claimed child benefit, the law allows claims to be backdated for a maximum of three months.; 0
0404.00049; 'A more generous backdating would require legislative change and would make it harder to verify evidence and establish entitlement, since entitlement to child benefit relies upon being responsible for a child each week. 'Generally, in straightforward cases, an original birth certificate will be satisfactory evidence a claimant is responsible for a child as the maximum period a claim can be backdated for is three months.

0409.00001; EditorNewyddion - News  LOCAL Assembly Member Lee Waters has claimed a victory for parents and pupils across Llanelli and Carmarthenshire. Following feedback from concerned parents, Lee Waters AM has secured a commitment from Carmarthenshire County Council to review how it helps parents fund the cost of back to school through the Pupil Development Grant (Access). The grant, funded by the Welsh Government, is available to parents as their children enter reception class, secondary school, or begin their GCSEs.; 0
0409.00002; It helps with the cost of uniforms and other school supplies.; 0
0409.00003; Carmarthenshire Council had been paying the grant retrospectively, with parents having to submit receipts for items purchased. A number of residents told Lee Waters AM that this had created problems for parents grappling with the high cost of back to school alongside other household bills. Most other counties in Wales pay the grant up front to parents, making it easier for those with little disposable income to claim.; 0
0409.00004; In correspondence with Lee Waters, the Local Authority have said they will be looking to learn from neighbouring Councils. Lee Waters AM said  This is a real win for parents in and around Llanelli.; 0
0409.00005; The cost of school uniform and equipment can be really high, especially for families who are already struggling to make ends meet. I was worried when I heard that Carmarthenshire only paid the grant retrospectively. When Welsh Government decided to fund the grant, we wanted to help families.; 0
0409.00006; But expecting families to pay the cost upfront and get paid back later only makes it harder, especially for those most in need.; 0
0409.00007; I'm really pleased that the Council have agreed to review their policy, and hopefully we can avoid this situation in the future and make sure we're able to help anyone who needs it.; 0
0409.00008; Until the process is reviewed, Carmarthenshire Council can purchase items on parents behalf on application and also allow the submission of multiple claims to help parents spread the cost.; 0

0414.00001; Message July 22nd 2019 But what is true about that?; 0
0414.00002; What is considered failure for an investor, and what implications does it have for the entrepreneur?; 0
0414.00003; A Debatable Truth This statistic, which fills even the most painted with apprehension and fear, of course, contains a reality in itself, but it has two aspects that are enormously nuanced and about which I think it is worth discussing: What is Failure? The issue of failure in startups really has to do with another element entirely: our definition of success.; 0
0414.00004; Socially, in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, it seems that the commonly accepted definition is that success is getting investment from venture capital funds (the bigger and more foreign the better) and then selling the company for an obscene number of millions.; 0
0414.00005; However, I think that this is just one of many options - perhaps the most extreme - with reference to the famous dilemma between being king or being rich . But there are a huge range of nuances - each of which are absolutely personal for each founder - that should also be taken into account: To be successful is to have a company that makes money every month?; 0
0414.00006; To be successful is to create a business that brings enormous value to its clients/users? Is being successful doing something that you love, and that makes you feel good?; 0
0414.00007; To be successful is to be able to have a company and at the same time a rich private life?; 0
0414.00008; All these definitions are as valid as winning an obscene amount of money, but not all have the same (obviously) interest for an investor .; 0
0414.00009; The problem is that, sometimes, even if you opt for the be rich option at the beginning, the market or the circumstances can make your business only a company without large growth that employs people, earn money at the end of the month and contribute value.; 0
0414.00010; Although these things can happen along the way, I think it is key that no startup considers seeking money from private investors if it is not willing to try to execute and grow an ambitious and scalable business model.; 0
0414.00011; For Whom is it a Failure? And with this question we get to the heart of the matter: for an investor the minimum aspiration is that the total of their investments (what we call portfolio) as a whole not only have a positive return but also generate a capital gains comparably higher than if they invested in other assets of lesser risk (because investment in startups carries a lot of risk).; 0
0414.00012; But the question we often don't ask ourselves is, what about the other 8-9?; 0
0414.00013; So typically 3 or 4 close in a period of five years (don't pay much attention to the specific number), 4-6 become bad investments (as long as they don't generate enough returns to cover the assumed risk) and 1 or 2 generate those big returns we were talking about. But the key is to understand who these 4-6 companies are: often they are companies that have not been able to realize that high growth potential, and that despite having achieved profitability, they do not have a way to return the money to their clients.; 0
0414.00014; Shareholders (beyond annual dividends) and perhaps they are in the grey zone.; 0
0414.00015; That is to say they are not companies that a priori is going to be bought, in which a large fund is going to be invested (buying shares from previous investors) or that are considering going public... but they are profitable companies and can even be growing, although not explosively. But are these companies failures in the absolute?; 0
0414.00016; The Problem: Non-Aligned Incentives between Founders and Investor This brings me to one of the most controversial and least talked about issues: the real misalignment between investors and entrepreneurs. INVESTOR: On the one hand, investors are interested in continuing to bet, investing and helping to promote the scalable growth of those companies in which they participate and which are doing well and the failures of others are assumed as natural (something absolutely consistent with their incentives as investors, eye). ENTREPRENEUR: On the other hand the founders, depending on their definition of success (as we've commented before), may not be looking for an all-or-nothing approach and, although they initially aimed to create something big and big-growth, they may be happy with a profitable company that adds value, even if it can't scale.; 0
0414.00017; In my opinion there is no good or bad in this film, nor is the investor a shark for wanting to defend the money that has cost him so much to win, nor the entrepreneur a failure to have not hit him .; 0
0414.00018; It seems to me that there are no unique or correct answers on what is the best way to resolve this misalignment, beyond being extremely sincere among all partners (founders and investors alike) and periodically reassessing which model the company is going to follow.; 0

0416.00001; >  Developing economies' subordinate financialisation Jomo Kwame Sundaram -  Michael Lim Mah Hui /  24 Sep 2019 / 20:09 H.  RAPID financial globalisation is due not only to financial innovations, but also to choices made by national policymakers, often with naïve expectations, trusting promoters' promises of steady net inflows of financial resources.; 0
0416.00002; Rapid financialisation has involved fund or asset investment managers operating internationally, managing assets for transnational institutional and retail investors and investing a growing share of transnational financial assets. Even retail investors are attracted by such fund managers offering attractive alternatives for investing in various asset markets, including index funds.; 0
0416.00003; To attract foreign institutional investments interested in capturing more rents, they demand more favourable terms, thus changing national financial systems.; 0
0416.00004; Successfully attracting transnational finance thus limits emerging market economies' policy space to develop their economies.; 0
0416.00005; Facilitating financialisation  The enabling environment to attract capital inflows typically allows them to circumvent regulations and other institutional constraints.; 0
0416.00006; Deepening national capital markets by relying on transnational finance typically involves subordinate or dependent financialisation. This typically requires modifying national financial systems to better serve transnational finance and transitioning from traditional banking to financial asset markets.; 0
0416.00007; Thus, developing countries, that open their capital accounts or encourage transnational portfolio investments, become especially vulnerable.; 0
0416.00008; In the early 2000s, after the 1997-1998 Asian financial crises, the Group of 8 (G8) major economies, supported by the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Germany's Bundesbank, promoted local currency bond markets. Soon, local currency bond markets in Asia (ex-Japan) rose 10-fold from US$836 billion in 2000 to US$8.3 trillion in 2015.; 1
0416.00009; Subordinate securitisation  It was claimed that deeper national securities markets, especially local currency bond markets, would redress both currency and maturity mismatches of short-term foreign currency borrowings by local banks and corporations. Such markets were expected to reduce global imbalances as countries with surpluses would no longer need to recycle savings in US financial markets.; 0
0416.00010; However, an UNCTAD-South Centre study argued that local currency bond markets are double-edged, addressing the risks of currency mismatches for individual borrowers, while exacerbating the systemic risks associated with the nation's currency.; 0
0416.00011; When developing economies' equity and bonds are largely foreign-held, their currencies are more vulnerable. Development finance is thus redeployed to ensure profits for private finance, investors and companies.; 0
0416.00012; International financial anarchy unchecked  Efforts to deepen national capital markets have been backed by powerful financial interests, domestic and foreign, especially the major international financial institutions.; 0
0416.00013; Multilateral development banks have been urging developing country governments to get private finance to fund development, social and environmental initiatives.; 0
0416.00014; Their message has shifted from working on finance, to try to ensure more resilient and robust development despite international financial volatility and instability, to thus working with finance.; 0
0416.00015; Meanwhile, institutional investment managers are expected to turn to impact investing with supposedly beneficial effects, such as green bonds, development impact bonds and infrastructure bonds.; 0
0416.00016; To make matters worse, there is no international financial regulator, as all regulation and regulators are national, even in implementing Bank of International Settlements (BIS) standards.; 0
0416.00017; Both the BIS and the IMF acknowledge cross-border transmission of risks, but national regulators focus on their national economies, leaving others more vulnerable than ever. -  IPS  Jomo Kwame Sundaram, a former economics professor, was United Nations assistant secretary-general for Economic Development, and received the Wassily Leontief Prize for Advancing the Frontiers of Economic Thought.; 0

A Roth IRA is a type of tax-advantaged individual retirement account that allows you to grow savings or investments until retirement by paying taxes at the time of contribution, and then make qualified withdrawals of your account contributions and earnings tax-free.; 0
0420.00008; Like a traditional IRA, you need to know IRA withdrawal rules when using a Roth. For example, unlike a traditional IRA, you can withdraw your contributions to a Roth IRA at any time without paying income taxes or penalties.; 0
0420.00009; Roth IRA When comparing a traditional IRA and Roth IRA, it's all about the tax advantages between the two. Neither is necessarily better than the other, but each one offers something unique from the other.; 0
0420.00010; A traditional IRA allows contributions that tax year to be deducted from your taxable income.; 0
0420.00011; This means you can lower your taxable income amount by making IRA contributions.; 0
0420.00012; Not everyone qualifies for this deduction to income, however.; 0
0420.00013; The deductibility of your contributions to traditional IRAs are subject to income limits if you or your spouse is covered by a retirement plan at work.; 0
0420.00014; Another downside to the traditional IRA is that your withdrawals (your contributions and earnings) from the account are taxed, even after retirement. Essentially, you're paying later for the money saved today.; 0
0420.00015; You also need to take minimum distributions from a traditional IRA once you hit 70 1/2 years old, so your account will slowly empty out.; 0
0420.00016; Unlike a traditional IRA or 401(k), a Roth IRA doesn't give you any tax benefit at the time of contribution. So, any contributions won't help you lower your taxable income that year.; 0
0420.00017; The benefits?; 0
0420.00018; Roth IRA contributions have higher income eligibility limits.; 0
0420.00019; Best of all, you won't pay any taxes when you make qualified withdrawals.; 0
0420.00020; You also don't have to make minimum withdrawals from your Roth account after retirement. This allows you to leave your account untouched if you want, making it a great nest egg to leave for your loved ones after you pass away.; 0
0420.00021; Who Should Use a Roth IRA? If choosing between traditional and a Roth IRA, consider the following:  With a traditional IRA you can lower your taxable income by contributing to your IRA before the end of the tax year.; 0
0420.00022; You then pay taxes when you retire and make qualified withdrawals. So, if you think you'll be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement, this could be a safe route.; 0
0420.00023; If you think you might be in a higher tax bracket when you retire, then you might want to pay the income taxes when you contribute to your Roth IRA while you're still in a lower tax bracket, since this account allows you to make qualified withdrawals upon retirement without paying taxes at the higher rate. If you're a young working professional with a high earning potential or someone who's built wealth (or planning to) by investing diligently over the years, this route could save you thousands upon retirement, assuming your tax bracket is much higher.; 0
0420.00024; Whether or Not You'll Pull From Your Account If you might need to withdraw from your retirement account prior to retirement (the IRS only allows withdrawals starting at age 59 1/2), note that your contributions to your Roth IRA can always be withdrawn without taxes or penalties.; 0
0420.00025; Any earnings in your Roth IRA are subject to withdrawal rules. In contrast, all funds in a traditional IRA are always taxed penalties apply if withdrawn earlier than age 59 1/2 (with exceptions for hardship). Lastly, if you don't plan on actually taking money out of your IRA, you can theoretically leave a larger inheritance of retirement savings to your heirs using a Roth account.; 0
0420.00026; This is because your account can grow for your loved ones even after you're gone, and there are no taxes due when your beneficiaries make qualified withdrawals.; 0
0420.00027; In short, your IRA preferences come down to how badly you need the tax break today, and if you think you'll be in a higher tax bracket when you retire.; 0
0420.00028; There are, of course, other investment account options, like a taxable investment account, that you can consider using in tandem with these tax-advantaged retirement accounts. As always, consider speaking with a financial advisor to solidify your retirement planning.; 0
0420.00029; If you've decided to move forward with a Roth IRA, review the IRS requirements carefully, and look over your options thoroughly before choosing to go with any broker or company. 1. Check Roth IRA Eligibility Not all people qualify for a Roth IRA.; 0
0420.00030; If you are married and file jointly, you can't make more than $203,000 each year.; 1
0420.00031; For those who file individually, your income can't exceed $137,000. The income limits are the primary criteria that can make you ineligible, so if your income falls within the guidelines, you will qualify for a Roth IRA.; 0
0420.00032; If you're not eligible for a Roth IRA on account of your income, there are Roth 401(k), 403(b) or governmental 457(b) plans available.; 0
0420.00033; These offer the same tax benefits as a Roth IRA, but don't have the income limitations.; 0
0420.00034; If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute to your Roth 401(k) first prior to your Roth IRA to take advantage of that match.; 0
0420.00035; Note, however, that employer matching contributions will be tax-deferred funds, meaning this portion of your 401(k) will be taxed upon withdrawal. If you have a Roth 401(k) plan and you leave your job, you can roll that account into a Roth IRA to keep growing your account.; 0
0420.00036; 2.; 0
0420.00037; Know the Contribution Limits As is the case with tax-advantaged retirement accounts, there are contribution limits to be aware of. These limits can't be exceeded without incurring a penalty, so be mindful of them.; 0
0420.00038; For a Roth IRA account, the contribution limit in 2019 is $6,000 with an additional $1,000 for employees that are age 50 and over.; 0
0420.00039; 3. Decide Where to Open Your Roth IRA You have three primary routes you can take with a Roth IRA: do-it-yourself brokerage, a financial advisor, or a robo-advisor. If you're the type that likes to learn a lot and manage tasks yourself, going through an online brokerage is likely the solution for you. This allows you to go online, build your own diversified portfolio, and choose your investments yourself.; 0
0420.00040; There are online fees and commissions to pay, but these fees are often less than those associated with a professional investment manager. These lower fees can make the online brokerage route attractive, especially if you're just starting out. Traditional brokerage involves a paid financial consultant or licensed broker who can guide you through the entire investment process and create a Roth IRA portfolio that fits your goals.; 0
0420.00041; Investment managers can sometimes have hefty management fees of up to 2% of assets under management, but many people turn to them to help ensure they have a healthy retirement income when the time comes.; 0
0420.00042; This route, while sometimes costly, is ideal for those uncomfortable with the thought of building their own portfolio and want the one-on-one relationship of a financial advisor.; 0
0420.00043; Lastly, there are robo-advisors.; 0
0420.00044; A robo-advisor uses technology to apply their investment policy to choose investments for you, taking out the guesswork.; 0
0420.00045; Robo-advisors often have some management fees or service fees attached as well, but they can be more affordable than a financial consultant.; 0
0420.00046; If you're considering a robo-advisor, be sure to read up on the top robo-advisor options ahead of time.; 0
0420.00047; 4. Understand Your Investment Style Once you decide where to open your account, it's time to know how you want to invest.; 0
0420.00048; How your money is invested makes a huge difference. Short-term, aggressive growth in a few high-flying stocks could mean your account grows noticeably in a few years, but also that your savings can take a dive due to a collapsed market.; 0
0420.00049; Long-term, safe growth could mean you're left with less actual growth, but growth that doesn't keep up with inflation.; 0
0420.00050; Finding the mix of investments that gives you income and gains with the appropriate amount of risk  -  and that meet your personal goals and risk tolerance  -  is the key. If you're going the DIY route, you're going to want to do some heavy homework to learn about investing to make an educated decision on where your money should go. If you're going with a financial advisor, they'll likely ask you about your retirement goals and risk tolerance.; 0
0420.00051; Do you want aggressive growth? Or, are you more comfortable playing it a little safer?; 0
0420.00052; Your answers will help a financial advisor understand where your money should go. Consider selecting an advisor who follows the fiduciary standard, meaning the advisor is obligated legally to work in your best interest above their own.; 0
0420.00053; Similarly, a robo-advisor will also ask questions about your financial goals, which will help it determine the appropriate ready-made investment portfolio for your money.; 0
0420.00054; It's time to make your Roth IRA official.; 0
0420.00055; Now that you've learned about the Roth IRA rules and weighed your options carefully, you can make the best decision of whether the Roth IRA is right for you.; 0
0420.00056; You're also ready to move forward on your own, or with a financial advisor or robo-advisor.; 0
0420.00057; While you want to be careful, remember that the sooner you start, the sooner your Roth IRA and other investment accounts will grow.

0424.00002; Woodward was available for a grilling about United's problems on the pitch when he chaired a regular quarterly-review session after announcing record revenues of £627.1million. 1Credit: AFP  -  Getty  But in a rare chance to hold the executive vice-chairman to account for some of the decisions being made at Old Trafford, the only question he faced was from someone who couldn't grasp how a player can be sent out on loan to another club.; 0
0424.00003; The investor asked: You mentioned player loans, I sometimes find that a little confusing.; 0
0424.00004; I get the transfer market but can you explain why loans have taken off and what they actually mean?; 0
0424.00005; Woodward, who has been criticised for overseeing a dramatic slump in fortunes for United since taking charge, briefly explained how the loan system worked. But that was still not enough for the puzzled money-man from a city corporation. He followed up: Let me ask directly, is a loan a way to work around paying agent fees?; 0

0425.00002; Today, let's focus on one of the specific tax hikes they want.; 0
0425.00003; There is near-unanimity among Democratic presidential candidates for higher tax rates on capital gains .; 0
0425.00004; Given the importance of savings and investment to economic growth, this is quite misguided. The Tax Foundation summarizes many of the key issues in capital gains taxation.; 0
0425.00005; …viewed in the context of the entire tax system, there is a tax bias against income like capital gains.; 0
0425.00006; This is because taxes on saving and investment, like the capital gains tax, represent an additional layer of tax on capital income after the corporate income tax and the individual income tax.; 0
0425.00007; Under a neutral tax system, each dollar of income would only be taxed once.; 0
0425.00008; …Capital gains face multiple layers of tax, and in addition, gains are not adjusted for inflation.; 0
0425.00009; This means that investors can be taxed on capital gains that accrue due to price-level increases rather than real gains.; 0
0425.00010; …there are repercussions across the entire economy. Capital gains taxes can be especially harmful for entrepreneurs, and because they reduce the return to saving, they encourage immediate consumption over saving.; 0
0425.00011; Here's a chart depicting how this double taxation creates a bias against business investment. Here are some excerpts from a column in the Wall Street Journal on the topic of capital gains taxation.; 0
0425.00012; The authors focus on Laffer-Curve effects and argue that higher tax rates can backfire. I'm sympathetic to that argument, but I'm far more concerned about the negative impact of higher rates on economic performance and competitiveness.; 0
0425.00013; …there is a relatively simple and painless way to maintain the federal coffers: Restore long-term capital-gains tax rates to the levels in place before President Obama took office.; 0
0425.00014; A reduction in this tax could generate significant additional revenue.; 0
0425.00015; …This particular levy is unique in that most of the time the taxpayer decides when to realize his capital gain and, consequently, when the government gets its revenue.; 0
0425.00016; If the capital-gains tax is too high, investors tend to hold on to assets to avoid being taxed. As a result, no revenue flows to the Treasury.; 1
0425.00017; If the tax is low enough, investors have an incentive to sell assets and realize capital gains. Both the investors and the government benefit.; 0
0425.00018; …The chance to test that theory came in May 2003, when Congress lowered the top rate on long-term capital gains to 15% from 20%. According to the Congressional Budget Office, by 2005-06 realizations of capital gains had more than doubled - up 151% - from the levels for 2002-03. Capital-gains tax receipts in 2005-06, at an average of $98 billion a year, were up 81% from 2002-03.; 1
0425.00019; Tax receipts reached a new peak of $127 billion in 2007 with the maximum rate still at 15%.; 0
0425.00020; By comparison, federal capital-gains tax receipts were a mere $7.9 billion in 1977 (the equivalent of about $31 billion in 2017 dollars), according to the Treasury Department. The effective maximum federal capital-gains tax was then 49%.; 1
0425.00021; …Using our post-2003 experience as a guide, we can predict a dramatic improvement in realizations and tax receipts if the top capital-gains tax rate is lowered to 15%.; 0
0425.00022; …but that's not the only benefit.; 0
0425.00023; Such changes also increase the mobility of capital by inducing investors to realize gains.; 0

0427.00002; (AP Photo/Michael Sohn) By GREGORY KATZ Associated Press |  Posted: Sun 10:05 PM, Sep 22, 2019 |  Updated: Mon 3:09 AM, Sep 23, 2019  LONDON (AP)  -  British tour company Thomas Cook collapsed early Monday after failing to secure emergency funding, leaving tens of thousands of vacationers stranded abroad.; 1
0427.00003; The British government said the return of the 178-year-old firm's 150,000 British customers now in vacation spots across the globe would be the largest repatriation in its peacetime history.; 0
0427.00004; The process began Monday and officials warned that delays are inevitable.; 0
0427.00005; The Civil Aviation Authority said Thomas Cook has ceased trading, its four airlines will be grounded, and its 21,000 employees in 16 countries, including 9,000 in the U.K., will lose their jobs.; 1
0427.00006; The company several months ago had blamed a slowdown in bookings because of Brexit uncertainty for contributing to its crushing debt burden.; 0
0427.00007; The company had said Friday it was seeking 200 million pounds ($250 million) to avoid going bust and was in weekend talks with shareholders and creditors to stave off failure.; 1
0427.00008; The firm, whose airliners were a familiar sight in many parts of the world, also operated around 600 U.K. travel stores.; 0
0427.00009; The company's chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, said in a statement read outside the company's offices Monday morning that he deeply regrets the shutdown.; 0
0427.00010; Despite huge efforts over a number of months and further intense negotiations in recent days we have not been able to secure a deal to save our business, he said. I know that this outcome will be devastating to many people and will cause a lot of anxiety, stress and disruption.; 0
0427.00011; Britain's CAA said it had arranged an aircraft fleet for the complex British repatriation effort, which is expected to last two weeks. Due to the significant scale of the situation, some disruption is inevitable, but the Civil Aviation Authority will endeavor to get people home as close as possible to their planned dates, the aviation authority said in a statement.; 0
0427.00012; Describing the repatriation plan, British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said dozens of charter planes, from as far afield as Malaysia, had been hired to fly customers home free of charge.; 1
0427.00013; He said hundreds of people were staffing call centers and airport operations centers. The task is enormous, the biggest peacetime repatriation in U.K. history.; 0
0427.00014; So there are bound to be problems and delays, he said.; 0
0427.00015; British travel expert Simon Calder told Sky News that Thomas Cook's problems started in 1994 when the open skies agreement allowed upstarts easyJet and Ryanair to flourish.; 0
0427.00016; At the same time, he said, the internet became widely used for travel bookings, lessening the demand for Thomas Cook's travel agencies. There's still of course a place for travel professionals, there's a place for the package already, as companies like Jet2 and TUI are demonstrating, but Thomas Cook was behind the curve and I'm afraid with high costs such as those expensive high street premises they simply couldn't cope, he said.; 0
0427.00017; Traveler Lucy Jessop from the eastern city of Hull said she had been scheduled to return from Mexico to Manchester with Thomas Cook on Tuesday and that the government had organized an alternative flight back to England.; 0
0427.00018; She said she was initially worried by the collapse and praised the government's quick action. It's the employees of Thomas Cook and all those due to go on holiday I feel for, she said.; 0
0427.00019; We were the lucky ones, I suppose. Unions representing the Thomas Cook staff had urged the British government to intervene to prop up Thomas Cook to protect jobs and the traveling public.; 0
0427.00020; British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government was right not to bail out the company, arguing that travel firms should do more to ensure they don't collapse. Johnson said the government would help bring home the stranded British travelers. But he said bailing out the company would have established a moral hazard because other firms might later expect the same treatment.; 0
0427.00021; We need to look at ways in which tour operators one way or another can protect themselves from such bankruptcies in future, Johnson said.; 0
0427.00022; One is driven to reflect on whether the directors of these companies are properly incentivized to sort such matters out. Most of Thomas Cook's British customers are protected by the government-run travel insurance program, which makes sure vacationers can get home if a British-based tour operator fails while they are abroad.; 0
0427.00023; An earlier repatriation exercise following the 2017 collapse of Monarch Airlines cost the government about 60 million pounds. The Thomas Cook effort is much larger and likely to be far more costly.; 0
0427.00024; Travelers holding reservations with Thomas Cook were told not to go to the airport because all flights had been canceled. Thomas Cook, which began in 1841 with a one-day train excursion in England and now operates in 16 countries, has been struggling over the past few years.; 0
0427.00025; It only recently raised 900 million pounds ($1.12 billion), including receiving money from leading Chinese shareholder Fosun. An estimated 1 million future travelers will find their bookings for upcoming holidays cancelled.; 0
0427.00026; They are likely to receive refunds under the terms of the government's travel insurance plan. In May, the company reported a debt burden of 1.25 billion pounds and cautioned that political uncertainty related to Britain's scheduled departure from the European Union at the end of October had hurt demand for summer holiday travel.; 0
0427.00027; Heat waves over the past couple of summers in Europe have also led many people to stay at home, while higher fuel and hotel costs have weighed on the travel business. The company's troubles were already affecting those traveling under the Thomas Cook banner.; 0
0427.00028; A British vacationer told BBC radio on Sunday that the Les Orangers beach resort in the Tunisian town of Hammamet, near Tunis, demanded that guests who were about to leave pay extra money, for fear it wouldn't be paid what it is owed by Thomas Cook. Ryan Farmer said many tourists refused the demand, since they had already paid Thomas Cook, so security guards shut the hotel's gates and were not allowing anyone to leave.; 0
0427.00029; It was like being held hostage, said Farmer, who is due to leave Tuesday. He said he would also refuse to pay if the hotel asked him.; 0
0427.00030; The Associated Press called the hotel, as well as the British Embassy in Tunis, but no officials or managers were available for comment. ___  Associated Press writer Jill Lawless in New York contributed to this report.; 0

0431.00001; Opinion / Editorials  Pinky Moholi's sudden resignation from Old Mutual sends out all the wrong signals at a time when the life insurer, still wrestling with its unwanted former CEO Peter Moyo, can least afford it 26 September 2019 - 05:00  Pinky Moholi. Picture: FINANCIAL MAIL  Pinky Moholi's sudden resignation from Old Mutual sends out all the wrong signals at a time when the life insurer, still wrestling with its unwanted former CEO Peter Moyo, can least afford it.; 0
0431.00002; Moholi, who by one colleague's account was extremely effective, quit last week, citing personal reasons.; 0
0431.00003; She is the first casualty from a board that may be starting to buckle from the strain of its acrimonious tussle with Moyo. The problem is that neither shareholders nor Old Mutual customers are any the wiser as to whether Moholi's decision to leave resulted from a disagreement over the company's strategy to engage Moyo through the courts, or whether it was fear that she may be found in contempt of court, along with the rest of the board, as Moyo's legal team have sought.; 0
0431.00004; Certainly, if the courts rule in favour of Moyo and Old Mutual's directors are declared delinquent in their handling of his dismissal, it will preclude them from serving on any other listed company's board.; 0
0431.00005; Besides having been on Old Mutual's board, Moholi, who was at one stage the Telkom CEO, is a nonexecutive director at both Woolworths and Anglo American Platinum. Her departure may simply be a case of determined self-preservation.; 0
0431.00006; Until now, Old Mutual chair Trevor Manuel has been contemptuous of suggestions that Moyo's axing is beginning to fracture its executive. In a testy exchange with BDTV anchor Alishia Seckam, Manuel described a unity of purpose and said: I certainly don't feel the two-camp story: it may be put out there by people who are now outside of the business and disgruntled but it doesn't match reality. In Manuel's telling of it, Old Mutual has been a reluctant participant in the litigation against Moyo, and never wanted a court dispute in the first place.; 0
0431.00007; The board will not flinch in its responsibilities to see that there is good corporate governance, Old Mutual told BDTV.; 0
0431.00008; We don't want to drag this thing out forever but it's unclear how this thing will end. Well, yes, and that's the problem. Now in its fourth month, the battle between Moyo and Old Mutual is beginning to resemble last year's at-times farcical row between the DA and former Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille.; 0
0431.00009; In that case, it was clear from the start that the relationship between the two had broken down irreparably.; 0
0431.00010; But a legal tug of war raged for the better part of a year and produced few winners, though, ever the survivor, De Lille founded a new political party and snagged a position in President Cyril Ramaphosa's cabinet as public works minister. It's fair to say that the DA came off worse, and it's not a stretch to argue that the breakdown in its relationship with De Lille damaged it badly in this year's crucial May elections. There is clearly a lesson for Old Mutual in this.; 0
0431.00011; Moholi's resignation is also a frustrating reminder that when it comes to transparency, JSE-listed companies are still allowed to get away with scant disclosure.; 0
0431.00012; While it's probably wishful thinking that the exchange could enforce regulations that compel company directors to be transparent about their motives, greater disclosure would help quell the febrile speculation that tends to accompany an unexpected board departure.; 0
0431.00013; It is, of course, the job of analysts and media to get to the truth behind a terse stock exchange news statement  -  but it must be said that listed companies do themselves a disservice by opting to say the bare minimum.; 0

0433.00001; Dividend Strategy  by: Mike Wald  Mike Wald  Value, dividend growth investing, long-term horizon, dividend investing  Summary  Dividend growth investing (DGI) is my prescription for building wealth for retirement. Contributions, transactions, and dividend income from RetirementRx are on track through August 2019. The portfolio has about 25% YoY growth in dividend income thus far.; 0
0433.00002; I include my musings on investing strategy, emerging risks, and possible adjustments. I contend that buying and owning stock for the long-term reinforces financial responsibility. For me, buying stock produces a sense of euphoria similar to when I purchase a long-sought after pair of stylish shoes.; 0
0433.00003; However, it is the long-term satisfaction of these two investments that distinguishes them. With shoes, you get to wear them almost immediately - shoe purchases offer instant satisfaction.; 0
0433.00004; With stock, you get the satisfaction of seeing the position in your account immediately and feeling a sense of ownership of a profitable business.; 0
0433.00005; However, we all know that the price starts to fluctuate immediately and the direction of fluctuation can either reinforce the investment decision or cast doubt on the price paid.; 0
0433.00006; Within only a few weeks, shoes quickly become part of your normal attire. This can also be true for stocks assuming the price hovers around the original purchase price. The difference between these two investments becomes much more striking in the long term.; 0
0433.00007; The owner's appreciation of a pair of shoes generally peaks within the first few years, eventually fading as the shoes wear out.; 0
0433.00008; If the stock is picked wisely and bought at a fair price, the satisfaction of owning the stock can grow considerably with time. This characteristic of stocks is what makes investing so enjoyable for me and fuels my investment savings.; 0
0433.00009; It also reinforces the notion to reinvest the returns instead of spending it on perceived needs - like more shoes. So, while Steve Martin may like stocks for the eventual money and things money can buy, I like investing in stocks for the things it stops me from buying.; 0
0433.00010; I love money. I love everything about it.; 0
0433.00011; I bought some pretty good stuff. Got me a $300 pair of socks. Got a fur sink.; 0
0433.00012; An electric dog polisher. A gasoline powered turtleneck sweater.; 0
0433.00013; And, of course, I bought some dumb stuff, too. --Steve Martin  Introduction  I started RetirementRx, a plan and portfolio, in 2013 with a target dividend income equal to my 2013 annual salary adjusted for 2% inflation.; 0
0433.00014; To achieve this dividend income in time for my retirement, the portfolio must grow with an organic dividend income of 8% YoY and cash contributions must grow 4% annually.; 1
0433.00015; As part of the plan, I have committed to write about my journey here on Seeking Alpha.; 0
0433.00016; In this article, I explain how I have managed the portfolio thus far in 2019, touching on contributions, transactions, and dividend performance.; 0
0433.00017; I also opine on upcoming milestones and areas for improvement.; 0
0433.00018; I hope my approach, results, and analyses help others plan for their own retirements. Contributions  I have already exceeded my planned contribution goal this year with $42,348 contributed vs $41,500 targeted and $41,292 based on 4% model. The sum is composed of the 401K contribution limit of $19K, a 6% company match, and $12,200 in cash to my after-tax account as of August.; 0
0433.00019; I intend to contribute more money over the remainder of the year to my after-tax account.; 0
0433.00020; My target cash infusion for 2020 will continue following the 4% increase, i.e., $42,650.; 0
0433.00021; Just to remind readers, RetirementRx contains four accounts: an after-tax brokerage account with Etrade, a Traditional IRA at Etrade, a Roth IRA at Motif, and a company sponsored 401k with Fidelity. Due to tax rules, I cannot currently contribute to the Roth and contributions to the Traditional IRA do not make financial sense.; 0
0433.00022; Despite this setup, my 401k allows contributions as both pre-tax (Traditional) and after-tax (Roth).; 0
0433.00023; This allows me to adequately balance my tax exposure while allowing the flexibility to minimize tax exposure of future distributions.; 0
0433.00024; Based on current balances, if I were to retire today (I know that I cannot for a number of reasons!), we would have 25% of our assets without tax exposure (Roth), 20% subject to the long-term capital gains tax, and 55% taxable at normal income tax levels.; 1
0433.00025; I intend to maintain this approximate distribution for the foreseeable future. Transactions  Through early September, I have made nine purchases, two sales (one through an options assignment), and sold one covered call to expire in November 2019.; 0
0433.00026; My purchases have focused on existing positions that look undervalued as well as two new positions in Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and 3M (NYSE:MMM).; 0
0433.00027; All 2019 transactions within the self-managed accounts of RetirementRx are tracked to the nearest dollar in the below table.; 0

Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) is the lone exception.; 0
0433.00029; There are 39 companies actively growing their distributions YoY with Ebix (NASDAQ:EBIX), Chatham Lodging Trust (CDLT), CVS Caremark (NYSE:CVS), and Omega Healthcare Investors (NYSE:OHI) as the exceptions. The following list ranks the stocks by percentage of portfolio dividend cash flow.; 0
0433.00030; Red fill identifies stocks that have not raised their dividend payments in the past year or whose last dividend raise was less than 5%.; 0
0433.00031; Blue fill identifies upcoming dates for expected dividend increase announcements. So far in 2019, two companies, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Fedex (FDX), have deviated from their pattern of regular dividend increases.; 0
0433.00032; While I do not see either company to be at risk of cutting the distribution, the hiatus from regular increases is concerning.; 0
0433.00033; To limit the effect of a protracted bear market in any one industry, I aim to keep the dividend income and portfolio value for each industry under 20%.; 1
0433.00034; However, this target allocation is only one consideration when making an investment decision.; 0
0433.00035; Due to the relatively low valuations in the healthcare space, namely the drug development companies of AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), and Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN), I have added to these positions and allowed the dividend income to slightly exceed the 20% limit.; 1
0433.00036; On the opposite end, due to the significant growth in consumer discretionary stocks such as Apple (OTC:APPL) and Disney (NYSE:DIS), this sector has breached 20% of the total portfolio value.; 1
0433.00037; As there are not many attractive opportunities in the consumer discretionary space at this time, I do not plan to add to this sector in the foreseeable future. At current prices, I also do not plan to sell any of these stocks, so rebalancing will be done primarily through the addition of new funds.; 0
0433.00038; Considering the pie charts below, I consider the Industrial and REIT sectors as the most likely destinations for future investment.; 0
0433.00039; As one of my goals is also to lower the overall beta of the portfolio, I will also consider names in Telecom, Utilities, and Oil/Energy.; 0
0433.00040; Dividend Cash Flow  Thus far in 2019, the portfolio has generated ~$5,000 in dividends.; 0
0433.00041; The monthly dividend payments from RetirementRx including the 401k are shown in the below figure. The projected 2019 dividend income for RetirementRx is $8,780.; 0
0433.00042; If this cash flow materializes, I will have exceeded both the modeled target dividend income of $7,746 and the stretch goal of $8,700 targeted at the beginning of 2019.; 1
0433.00043; Further, this 2019 achievement will set us up to breach the $10,000 dividend mark in 2020.; 1
0433.00044; The $10,000 milestone will most certainly be celebrated with a nice family dinner out or a weekend getaway. Before that milestone, I expect to see the $1,000 threshold breached on a regular basis for the March, June, September, and December payouts. The average dividend growth for all four accounts is ~25% and ~17% for the three self-managed accounts.; 0
0433.00045; Due to the differences in investment selection and funding frequency, the dividend growth of each account within RetirementRx can vary significantly.; 0
0433.00046; The table below shows the % DGRs relative to the first eight months of 2018. The after-tax account and the 401k receive new funds on a regular basis while the Roth and Traditional IRA only receive new funds via rollovers.; 0
0433.00047; Therefore, the DGRs for the after-tax and 401K reflect both organic income growth and income growth from new capital while that of the Roth and Traditional IRAs reflect only organic dividend growth achieved by dividend raises and dividend reinvestment.; 0
0433.00048; Since my target organic DGR is 8%, I am reassured to see the average DGR of the Roth and Traditional is ~8%.; 1
0433.00049; The DGR in the Roth is lower at 5.4% due primarily to its holding of REITs.; 1
0433.00050; -  YoY DGR(%)  -  After Tax  -  Trad. IRA  -  Roth IRA  -  3 self-managed  -  401K  -  All 4  -  2019 (through Aug)  -  47.8  -  12.3  -  5.4  -  17.3  -  182.1  -  24.7  Tracking Returns  So far in 2019, RetirementRx has reached an account value of $342K.; 0
0433.00051; This sum is composed of ~$228,000 in contributions, $26,000 in accumulated dividends, and $88,000 in capital appreciation.; 0
0433.00052; Oddly enough, this works out to an exact 50% total return (I have checked it thrice). In the below bar chart, the total return is the sum of the capital appreciation (green)and dividend payments (green).; 0
0433.00053; So far, 78% of RetirementRx's total return is associated with capital appreciation. However, I expect the dividend output illustrated by the green area to grow into a larger portion of the total return over time. In bull markets, the forces driving capital appreciation, namely earnings growth and multiple expansion, outpace dividend growth.; 0
0433.00054; When markets turn bearish, the blue gains can decrease substantially or even vanish, while the green dividends continue to grow.; 0
0433.00055; Because of this reality and since I do not sell to lock in gains within these accounts, I do not track my YoY growth on a regular basis. I believe such tracking is only helpful over longer periods of time, e.g. 5 years.; 0
0433.00056; Musings and Decisions  While I am satisfied with the performance of RetirementRx thus far in 2019, there are two areas of possible improvement.; 0
0433.00057; A 2019 goal is to suffer no dividend cuts and no more than one dividend freeze. I am happy to report that there have been no dividend cuts. Unfortunately, both Qualcomm and Fedex have frozen their dividends.; 0
0433.00058; Both companies are Dividend Contenders.; 0
0433.00059; While both companies can still manage to raise their dividend payout on YoY basis, the freezes are a clear sign that the tariff and trade wars are impacting profit growth and transparency.; 0
0433.00060; Based on QCOM's current and future payout ratios of 73% and 58%, a cut is very unlikely. Similarly, FDX's current and future payout ratios are under 17%.; 0
0433.00061; I expect FDX to increase the payout by the next announcement anniversary in Jun 2020 to retain its status as a Dividend Contender.; 0
0433.00062; The raise is likely to be in the single digits without clear resolution to the trade war. QCOM's raise may not occur until after legal challenges to their business model are resolved or the trade war is resolved.; 0
0433.00063; Of the two, QCOM is at greater risk of failing to achieve YoY dividend growth.; 0
0433.00064; As I believe in the company's prospects to lead in 5G, I am holding my position in QCOM pending further review of the management's commitment to shareholders.; 0
0433.00065; As I believe globalization is the most effective way to distribute labor, FDX's business will only grow and become more embedded in the economic output of all major countries.; 0
0433.00066; Therefore, I am not entertaining the idea of selling FDX.; 0
0433.00067; Other companies with significant exposure to the trade war are 3M, Cummins (NYSE:CMI), United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), and Boeing (NYSE:BA). I will be closely watching the dividend announcement of these companies: United Technologies's scheduled increase is in October and Boeing and 3M are scheduled for announcements in December.; 0
0433.00068; Additional freezes may require some reorganization of the industrial sector.; 0
0433.00069; Despite the challenges facing these companies, the trade war is not all bad. I was able to pick up 3M at a historically low valuation based on fears around trade war and corporate restructuring.; 0
0433.00070; It may be one of the best times to shuffle positions into high quality, beaten down names like 3M.; 0
0433.00071; The second area of improvement relates to RetirementRx's overexposure to the Consumer Discretionary sector.; 0
0433.00072; This sector would be one of the hardest hit in a bear market. My simple solution is to stop adding investment dollars into this sector. However, I have also decided to use covered calls to cap the overall exposure to this sector (hint: see the Options transaction in September in table above).; 0
0433.00073; Discussing this decision and how I chose what to sell will be a topic of my next article, which I intend to publish in the coming weeks. Dividend growth investing is a sound strategy for retirement planning as it shifts focus away from stock prices and towards long-term wealth generation.; 0
0433.00074; It also reinforces a savings mentality that I believe is one of its most underappreciated benefits. In today's market, dividend growth investing will help investors stick to their long-term plan and goals.; 0
0433.00075; I hope others find my plan and performance useful in their quest for generating income for their eventual or current retirement.; 0
0433.00076; As always, I encourage comments and discussions and value constructive feedback.; 0

0434.00013; That skepticism could be a good sign, says Doug Peta, chief US investment strategist at BCA Research.; 0
0434.00014; It shows that investors are not in the midst of a mania like they were in the late 1990s, when many dot-com companies that had little in the way of revenue, let alone profits, were going public and more than doubling on their first day of trading.; 0
0434.00015; We Company should try to be as profitable as possible.; 0
0434.00016; I'm not sure how elevating the world's consciousness fits into that framework.; 0
0434.00017; It seems awfully new age-y to me,' Peta said, referring to the company's derided mission statement in its IPO filing. It's a good sign that investors are pushing back on such a grandiose and somewhat amorphous business plan.; 0
0434.00018; This shows it's not 1999. People have not taken leave of their senses, he added. Uber and Lyft both hit all-time lows and continue to struggle since their IPOs  Some of the more successful companies that have gone public over the past few years are either already profitable or expected to generate actual earnings later this year and in 2020.; 0
0434.00019; That includes e-signing software company Docusign (DOCU), web conferencing firm Zoom Video (ZM) and plant-based food leader Beyond Meat (BYND).; 0
0434.00020; Many of the money-losing companies looking to go public now could struggle because investors are more discerning and are looking for profits, noted Alan Adelman, senior fund manager with Frost Investment Advisors. There has been a shift from growth stocks to more value stocks, Adelman said.; 0
0434.00021; Some of the recipients of the go-go growth trade have had the wind taken out of their sails.; 0
0434.00022; The big drops in Uber, Lyft and Slack are evidence of that trend. Longer-term investors are realizing it may be too soon to take a flier on some of these startups since there is no sign that they will be able to generate profits in the foreseeable future.; 0
0434.00023; But companies like Uber and Slack may be more similar to the scores of dot-coms that debuted in 1998 and 1999, as opposed to Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB), for example.; 0
0434.00024; While there were concerns about corporate governance at both of those companies at the times of their IPOs, Google and Facebook were also undeniable market leaders in their industry when they went public. And both were profitable.; 0
0434.00025; So while Google shares didn't skyrocket on their first day and Facebook's even fell in their first few months as investors worried if the company would successfully transition to a more mobile-focused strategy, each stock has soared in the past few years and are both now among the world's most valuable companies.; 0

0436.00001; Lifestyle Content  , BY: Jul 16, 2019  The founders of industrial engineering, Frank and Lillian Gilbreth, pioneered the use of time motion studies to create more efficient methods that powered the businesses of the early 20th century.; 0
0436.00002; They even consulted on creating more efficient Operating Rooms. Much of the standard layout of today's Operating Rooms bear their organizational stamp (wheels on surgical carts, a designated person to supervise surgical instruments). Today, surgery centers can become their own efficiency experts by learning how to uncover and address some of the most common inefficiencies in their organization.; 0
0436.00003; It may take some extra time and attention, but the resulting dividends  -  in profitability as well as patient and employee satisfaction  -  are well worth it.; 0
0436.00004; Here are three areas of ASC operations where efficiency improvements can have the greatest impact. From the outset, scheduling snafus can bake inefficiency into the ASC cake.; 0
0436.00005; The physician office contacts the surgery center.; 0
0436.00006; The two offices exchange phone calls to confirm the case. Then the information is manually entered from the physician's office into the surgery center's practice management software.; 0
0436.00007; It's an inefficient routine that many centers, sensitized to thinking only about the immediate tasks in front of them, don't spot right away. Technology can automate some of the most repetitive scheduling tasks, and streamline the physician office to surgery center communication process.; 0
0436.00008; The endoscopy study also identified post-surgery patient transportation, and patients who were either late or no-shows as inefficienciesthat increased patient education efforts can remedy.; 0
0436.00009; Medical charting systems with scheduling software that allows for prompting the scheduler to ask directly about transportation, and the use of automated reminders and other methods to remind patients to arrive on time, optimize patient flow. The scheduler empowered to double check if transportation is available for a newly discharged patient is just one example of how pivotal staff training is for creating a more efficient surgery center.; 0
0436.00010; Building an environment where teamwork, communication and collaboration are in high gear doesn't happen overnight. Effective leaders take time out of the daily operations to make sure each staff member is adequately prepared for the jobs needed, and conduct regular process improvement evaluations to ensure continued success. Just as surgical staff perform a separate, highly-skilled task for each procedure, the billing office must work in concert to get clean claims out the door as quickly as possible.; 0
0436.00011; Whether it's scheduling, verification, coding or any other billing function, failure to adequately train for any of the jobs along the way increases the chance of error and wastes precious time.; 0
0436.00012; Staff members should be adequately prepared to do their job right the first time, and cross-trained to provide much needed back-up to cover absences. In addition, cross-training helps employees realize how others in their department manage their time, and how they contribute to the overall success of the team.; 0
0436.00013; All of this training takes time that leadership often doesn't have.; 0
0436.00014; But they don't have to go it alone.; 0
0436.00015; Vendors can provide needed training support  -  especially when it comes to digital patient charts. Beyond the on-site training that comes with onboarding to a new system, centers can rely on vendor support teams to find new ways to optimize the chart.; 0
0436.00016; Centers can look to these support teams not just for when things go wrong, but to identify ways to eliminate inefficiencies and optimize the charting process.; 0
0436.00017; But choose wisely: some vendors' idea of customer support consists of an offshore team with limited hours. Others, (like us) provide 24/7, US-based support. It also helps if the chart that staff are trained on resembles their old patient paper chart -  which ours does too!; 0
0436.00018; All the Reviews: Peer, QAPI and Chart Quality and compliance, together with the required reporting, are the bane of every ASC. It's no wonder: focus groups at this year's ASCA meeting revealed the average ASC submits 30 or more reports each month. Participants in one focus session indicated they spend 4 or more hours compiling and modifying weekly reports.; 0
0436.00019; Peer review, Quality Assurance/Performance Improvement (QAPI) studies, and chart review are all necessary to provide great, safe care.; 0
0436.00020; But they vacuum up time from administrators and staff, and have negative effects on a center's bottom line.; 0
0436.00021; Chart Reviews, Simplified Take chart reviews.; 0
0436.00022; Often, centers will step back from the daily workflow and manually go back through cases to begin building the necessary reports, data element by data element.; 0
0436.00023; Medical EMR programs might be able to automatically run a report based on a single data element, but who runs a report to measure just one data point? Administrators should look for software that can run multiple data elementssimultaneously, as well as provide more detailed reporting.; 0
0436.00024; For example, a normothermia report might reveal no issues with normothermia, but reveal an alarmingly high ASA rating for comorbidities. Software tools that allow for creating additional custom modules for additional data that might impact the ASA rating  -  weight, age, diagnosis, etc.; 0
0436.00025; -  help build a case for what might be common cause and add it to the report.; 0
0436.00026; Beyond saving time and duplicate effort, the report becomes the basis for a quality improvement project.; 0
0436.00027; After her husband's death, Lillian Gilbreth continued her industrial engineering work  -  all while raising 11 children on her own. Not surprisingly, Gilbreth turned some of her attention to the domestic environment.; 0
0436.00028; Shelves on a refrigerator door?; 0
0436.00029; Lillian Gilbreth. The step-on trash can?; 0
0436.00030; Yep, that's her.; 0
0436.00031; The family is immortalized in the popular Cheaper by the Dozen memoir and subsequent film adaptations of the book. Like Gilbreth, ASCs know that time is our most precious commodity.; 0
0436.00032; Doing things the way they've always been done won't get you very far when it comes to making the best use of the time and materials available to you. Simplify's chart and practice management system are fully integrated to allow you to make your job easier, and help you uncover the inefficiencies that's keeping your center from running at peak performance.

0438.00004; Last-minute talks to try and save the world's oldest travel firm failed last night as more than 600,000 Thomas Cook customers were on trips abroad, according to reports.; 0

0438.00006; Richard Moriarty, chief executive of the UK Civil Aviation Authority, said: News of Thomas Cook's collapse is deeply saddening for the company's employees and customers, and we appreciate that more than 150,000 people currently abroad will be anxious about how they will now return to the UK.; 1
0438.00007; The government has asked us to support Thomas Cook customers on what is the UK's largest ever peacetime repatriation. We have launched, at very short notice, what is effectively one of the UK's largest airlines, involving a fleet of aircraft secured from around the world.; 0

0438.00009; We ask customers to bear with us as we work around the clock to bring them home.

0438.00010; The repatriation process will take place over the next two weeks, from September 23 to October 6, with the help of a fleet of aircraft from around the world. Throughout the crisis, customers have been desperate for answers, fearing they could be kicked out of hotels, struggle to find a way home or be left out of pocket if bookings were cancelled.; 0

0438.00012; Their dignity in carrying on working for Thomas Cook customers under this pressure is a credit to them.; 0

0438.00015; The Times has been told it could take two weeks to repatriate Britons, tweeted Steven Swinford, the paper's Deputy Political Editor. Peter Fankhauser, Thomas Cook's CEO, leaving a meeting yesterday  A final decision by Thomas Cook Group's directors to appoint insolvency practitioners is expected to be taken in the early hours of Monday barring a last-minute miracle, Sky News reported.; 0
0438.00016; The Official Receiver was expected to be involved in any insolvency process, with KPMG handling the administration or liquidation of Thomas Cook's UK tour operating division - including its 550-plus high street shops - and AlixPartners expected to oversee the insolvency of the group's airlines, the report added.

0440.00001; September 19, 2019 Increase the Age Credit to help our seniors get ahead Today, Andrew Scheer, the Leader of Canada's Conservatives, announced that a new Conservative government will increase the Age Credit by $1,000. This measure is part of the Conservative plan to put more money in the pockets of all Canadians to help them get ahead.; 0
0440.00002; The increase will benefit seniors with low or medium incomes most, said Scheer.; 0
0440.00003; Many seniors live on a fixed income and they are at the mercy of governments like Justin Trudeau's, which has increased the cost of living and the price of everyday essentials.; 0
0440.00004; Since the Age Credit is income-tested, it will benefit low to middle income seniors. With this measure, an individual aged 65 could receive up to $150 more per year and a couple could receive up to $300 more per year.; 1
0440.00005; Our commitment is clear: it's time for you to get ahead. This $300 tax relief for senior couples is on top of our Universal Tax Cut for all Canadians.; 0
0440.00006; We will also eliminate the GST from home heating costs and introduce the Green Public Transit Tax Credit.; 0
0440.00007; Seniors will benefit from all those tax cuts and file a single tax return in Québec, as we committed to do, concluded Mr. Scheer. This increase will be the third of its kind made by a Conservative government. In 2006, and again in 2009, Canada's Conservatives increased the Age Tax Credit by $1,000.; 0

0442.00001; R3 responds to Transport Minister's airline insolvency plans /in Commercial Credit /by Stephen Kiely  More consultation is needed before the Government progresses plans to change how planes are used in airline insolvencies, R3, the insolvency and restructuring trade body, has warned.; 0
0442.00002; Earlier this afternoon, during a ministerial statement on Thomas Cook, the Secretary of State for Transport, the Rt Hon Grant Shapps, said:  Firms need to be able to look after their customers and we need to be able to ensure their planes can keep flying in order that we don't have to set up a shadow airline.; 0
0442.00003; This is where we will focus our efforts in the next couple of weeks.; 0
0442.00004; We will require primary legislation, and, dare I say it, a new session of Parliament.; 0
0442.00005; R3 President Duncan Swift warns that, while the desire to 'keep the fleet flying' is understandable, there are practical reasons why this can be difficult to do when an airline is insolvent. He says: During an airline or travel company insolvency, planes are vulnerable to being held hostage by overseas creditors and suppliers and other stakeholders, which puts aircraft, crew and passenger safety at risk.; 0
0442.00006; Using chartered flights avoids this scenario.; 0
0442.00007; Changing the law in the UK won't necessarily change the behaviour of creditors overseas.; 0
0442.00008; We're yet to see a convincing solution to this potential problem.; 0
0442.00009; The Government is considering proposals made by an independent commission, chaired by Peter Bucks, formed in the wake of the Monarch airlines administration.; 0
0442.00010; Among the recommendations is a proposal that airline insolvency procedures prioritise passenger repatriation over repayments to creditors.; 0
0442.00011; Duncan Swift says: Prioritising passenger repatriation is practical if there is a means to pay for doing so.; 0
0442.00012; Without some form of insurance scheme, repatriation efforts would need to be funded by the insolvent airline itself.; 0
0442.00013; This would completely deplete what could be repaid to the airline's creditors, and would make lending to or trading with an airline a very risky business.; 0
0442.00014; ATOL protection could provide funding for repatriating package holiday travellers, but a solution is needed for flights-only travellers, too.; 0
0442.00015; The Government's intentions are good, but more detail is needed on its proposed solutions. Like most areas of insolvency, airline and travel company insolvencies are complex and need legislation that considers and caters for the full breadth and depth of people and groups affected, rather than something that is focused just on passengers.; 0
0442.00016; Repatriation of passengers is understandably an early priority, but they're not the only stakeholders that have to be considered in the overall process.; 0
0442.00017; Airline Insolvencies  -  Reforms on the Horizon?; 0
0442.00018; Briefing from insolvency and restructuring trade body R3 (September 2019)  Overview  In the wake of Monarch Airlines entering administration in 2017, the Government commissioned an independent review team to explore how consumers and taxpayers could be better protected when airlines become insolvent.; 0
0442.00019; For a number of practical reasons, it is very difficult to keep an insolvent airline's planes servicing routes. Consequently, Monarch's administration left hundreds of thousands of passengers stranded overseas, and left taxpayers with an estimated £60m repatriation bill.; 1
0442.00020; The independent review published its final report in May 2019, recommending a new insurance system for airlines, new powers for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), and the creation of a new Special Administration Regime for airline insolvencies.; 0
0442.00021; These recommendations are outlined below.; 0
0442.00022; While some aspects of the review's recommendations are welcome, others are problematic.; 0
0442.00023; They do not necessarily solve the issues which prevent insolvent airlines' planes from flying, and, if introduced, may have serious financial consequences for the airline sector in future.; 0
0442.00024; A Flight Protection Scheme  The review recommends the Government introduce a 'Flight Protection Scheme' (FPS) to fund passenger repatriation in the event of an airline becoming insolvent. This scheme would be paid for by the airlines themselves, and the review estimates that this would cost up to 50p per passenger.; 1
0442.00025; This proposal will have financial implications for airlines, and additional costs may be passed onto passengers. In response to the review's original call for evidence, R3 recommended that passenger repatriation could be funded by an expansion of the existing ATOL protection scheme, which currently operates as an insurance mechanism for 'package' travel arrangements, so that it can cover 'flights-only' arrangements.; 0
0442.00026; The proposed FPS would fulfil a similar function to an expanded ATOL scheme. Passenger Repatriation  The review recommends three means of repatriating passengers, funded by the FPS: self- and assisted-repatriation, where stranded passengers arrange their own flights home chartered repatriation, where a new, chartered fleet would be deployed and a 'keep the fleet flying' approach where the insolvent airline would continue to operate for a short time. The 'keep the fleet flying' approach would be supported by two further changes: changes to the CAA regime to allow insolvent airlines to retain their operating licence (this is currently suspended upon insolvency) and the introduction of a Special Administration Regime for airline insolvencies, which would prioritise passenger repatriation over maximising creditor returns.; 0
0442.00027; R3 has a number of concerns with the proposal that the Government should consider a 'keep the fleet flying' option.; 0
0442.00028; This approach does not address of the practicalities of airline insolvencies which prevent an insolvent airline from flying, and it will have a serious impact on the risks of trading with and lending to UK airlines.; 0
0442.00029; Practical Challenges  Even assuming insolvent airlines keep their operating licence, there will be a number of reasons why an insolvency office holder will not be comfortable with letting the airline's planes continue to fly. For example, the airline's planes can be vulnerable to action by overseas creditors, potentially putting aircraft and crew safety at risk: suppliers and other stakeholders may impound planes at non-UK airports, demanding repayment of debts in return for releasing the aircraft.; 0
0442.00030; Among many other factors, office holders will also consider crew wellbeing, and insurance costs.; 0
0442.00031; Moreover, the daily costs of running an airline are exorbitant and  -  without cash coming into the business in the form of fresh ticket sales  -  money can run out fast. Whether the FPS will be large enough to fund the full scope of an airline's operations, rather than simply funding charters or emergency ticket purchases, remains to be seen.; 0
0442.00032; Consequences of a Special Administration Regime  The review's proposal that a Special Administration Regime (SAR) prioritise passenger repatriation over maximising creditor returns could well have serious implications for the financial health of the airline sector, and the taxpayer.; 0
0442.00033; As above, running an airline is expensive and continuing operations will deplete the value of what the insolvent airline can repay to creditors.; 0
0442.00034; By increasing creditor losses in the event of an insolvency, an SAR for UK airlines may well deter lenders, investors, and other companies from lending to, investing in, or trading with a UK airline in the first place. Similarly, the costs of repatriation may mean funds are not left over to cover office holders' costs, disincentivising insolvency practitioners from taking airline appointments.; 0
0442.00035; This would leave airline insolvencies to be handled by the government's Official Receiver  -  and funded by the taxpayer. Recently, the Government has proposed that, in all insolvencies, the repayment of some HMRC debts be prioritised over repayment of most other categories of debt. This proposal has been met with strong criticism from UK lenders and business representatives, who have warned that the move will lead to a restriction on UK access to finance, trading and investment, driven by lenders and creditors reacting to the increased risks associated with insolvency.; 0
0442.00036; The airline SAR may have a similar impact.; 0
0442.00037; New CAA Powers  The review recommends additional powers for the CAA. As part of these increased powers, airlines would be required to: undergo annual certification to confirm financial fitness develop repatriation plans and provide access to data and to notify the CAA when there is a material change in its financial situation.; 0
0442.00038; As above, the review recommends the CAA have the power to grant a temporary licence to allow an insolvent airline to continue to fly in support of a repatriation operation.; 0
0442.00039; Next Steps  It is up to the Government whether or not to introduce the review's recommendations. The review itself acknowledges that more analysis of its recommendations is needed.; 0
0442.00040; The consultation is now closed and we're awaiting response from the Government. Stephen Kiely; 0
0443.00001; NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apple Inc struck out at a Goldman Sachs Group Inc analyst on Friday in a relatively rare public dust-up between a blue chip Wall Street firm and its client. The Apple logo is displayed at an event at their headquarters in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 10, 2019. REUTERS/Stephen Lam  The disagreement came after Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall criticized Apple's accounting methods for the tech giant's new TV+ product, saying in a research note that it may result in lower gross margins and profits. In response, Apple said it does not expect the introduction of Apple TV+, including the accounting treatment for the service, to have a material impact on our financial results.; 0
0443.00002; A Goldman spokeswoman declined to comment or to make the analyst available for interview. Apple also declined to comment on the Goldman relationship beyond its comment on the note. While research departments at large Wall Street banks have Chinese walls separating them from other functions, the rare public dispute is an awkward moment between the two companies.; 0
0443.00003; Goldman Sachs has underwritten more bond issuances for Apple in the last decade than any other investment bank, worth some $44 billion, according to financial data provider Refinitiv.; 0

He later criticized several analysts directly for negative calls.; 0
0443.00009; At the beginning of its fiscal year, Apple changed where it accounts for the value and costs of free services - like Apple Maps - and moved it into its services segment. Previously this was accounted for under the individual products.; 0
0443.00010; In his note, Goldman's Hall said Apple was likely to treat TV+ subscriptions in a similar way, by accounting for it as a discounted bundle of a free service paired with a hardware purchase. Hall said that would result in Apple investors seeing lower average selling prices for iPhones and other Apple devices but faster growth in the company's services segment.; 0
0443.00011; Many Apple investors have come to focus on growth in the services segment as the global smart phone market has stagnated, with Apple shares rising this year despite year over year declines in iPhone sales for its most recent two quarters.

0447.00001; Earlier this year, the United States Department of Agriculture announced it was pausing honey bee surveys for the remainder of the fiscal year due to budget cuts.; 0
0447.00002; Bee advocates went off the rails for several reasons, and protests were made as were appeals to local politicians to have these surveys resumed. With the start of the new fiscal year in October, the USDA announced it will once again resume the much needed and very important surveys. Bittersweet Victory  Make no mistake about it, the resumption of the honey bee surveys is exciting, but researches are not happy about the fact they will be missing a full quarter of important information.; 0
0447.00003; More than a few experts chimed in about the fact the missing information will impact research both now and for coming months.; 0
0447.00004; University of Maryland entomologist Dennis vanEngelsdorp stated, It's like having a GDP report with one quarter's report missing. This lack of information would always be disappointing, but this year, in particular, is of significant importance.; 0
0447.00005; Honey bee populations generally see a decline after winter, with about 30 percent losses in a typical year.; 1
0447.00006; This year, however, those losses were closer to 40 percent, with some professional beekeepers being put out of business.; 0
0447.00007; The information missing from the report is typically when the hives are beginning to repopulate. Point being, we are now going to be missing critical information related to the recovery of the hives from the particularly harsh winter. While the honey bee surveys being paused was devastating, the upside of the ordeal is that there is much more awareness around the country now about the plight of the honey bee.; 0
0447.00008; Once the pausing of the survey was announced, what was more of a niche story became national news.; 0
0447.00009; No longer only found on blogs like ours, colony collapse disorder and the importance of the honey bee to our crops was suddenly national news.; 0
0447.00010; The situation became such a story, in fact, that New York Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer was brought into the fold during a visit to upstate New York. Senator Schumer promised to do what he could to have the surveys resumed, but we saw little movement on the story after his promise and the resumption of the surveys seems to be business as usual for Washington rather than a promise fulfilled.; 0
0447.00011; Regardless, the fact Schumer was even discussing the matter means more coverage for honey bees and their plight.

0448.00003; Stephanie Kaye, 25, described how weeping staff were overwhelmed when Brits presented them with two carrier bags stuffed with cash. Fellow passenger Tommy Laing posted on Facebook: I've Just landed in Manchester from Vegas, was flying with Thomas cook, the staff told us mid flight that they'd just been told half way through the flight that we were on the last Thomas cook flight anywhere, they had just lost their jobs and would not be getting paid this month- they were all in tears!; 0
0448.00004; Soon as we landed a Scottish girl stands up- right folks I'm having a whip round get your money out £20 each! And if that's not the most Scottish thing ever I don't know what is was a joyful moment! Got £5000 apparently.; 0
0448.00005; Stephanie, from Leeds said the 326 passengers were made aware of the companies fate by the pilot - who told them that staff wouldn't be getting paid for the journey mid-air. She said: When we got on the plane, the staff were really friendly and professional.

0448.00006; And she said, if you're that way inclined, please say a little prayer for us and it got a bit emotional as everyone started clapping.; 0

0448.00011; But towards the end of the journey, passengers had started a little collection but it ended being quite a big collection. Everyone was putting in their remaining dollars and I think there was two bags going around so it turned out to be a lot of the money.; 0
0448.00012; People were very generous, they were throwing in wads of dollars, it was two carriers bags worth of coins and notes. And it got handed over at the end of the flight and staff came over the tannoy, they thanked us again for the support, and said how overwhelmed they were.; 0

0450.00001; Escalating trade wars crimp Sims Metal's profit outlook Metal and electronics recycler Sims Metal has warned a rapid deterioration of global demand for scrap metal will significantly affect the company's results for the first half of the financial year. The $2.5 billion listed company had already flagged in its full-year results last month that increasing escalation in trade wars, coupled with weak car sales, would reduce the demand for steel and aluminium over the medium term, but chief executive Alistair Field said in a trading update on Monday that conditions had further worsened.; 0
0450.00002; ASX-listed Sims Metal has warned escalating trade wars have hit the global demand for scrap metal.Credit:Photographer: Ryan Stuart  Mr Field said while it initially appeared steel mills were managing the lower demand, early this month mills had materially reduced their purchases. At the end of August, the scrap metal price including freight from Turkey, the world's largest scrap metal importer, sat at around $US268 ($389) per tonne. Midway through last week, it had fallen below $US240. This reduction in demand for scrap has driven a steep fall in prices, Mr Field said.; 1
0450.00003; Advertisement  The current sales price results in a buy price that is potentially below the level at which it is economic for a number of our suppliers to gather and sell scrap.; 0
0450.00004; Regardless, our strategy remains sound, and the business is well-positioned to deliver good returns through the commodity cycle. Sims Metal chief executive Alistair Field  Shares dropped sharply in morning trade, falling 12.6 per cent to $10.98.  Mr Field said while the company would be able to manage this steep decline in demand under normal market conditions, the fall has coincided with a consistent rise in deep-sea freight prices, leaving the company unable to recoup its costs in the very low price environment.; 0
0450.00005; While the company did not attach figures to its trading update, Mr Field said the company was expecting a materially lower result for the 2020 half-year when compared to the same period last year. Loading  In the first half of 2019, Sims Metal posted $3.3 billion in sales and an underlying net profit after tax (NPAT) of $76.7 million.; 0
0450.00006; Full-year sales for the US-based company were $6.64 billion, up 3 per cent on the year prior, though full-year underlying NPAT was down 14.2 per cent to $162 million.; 1
0450.00007; Simon Mawhinney, managing director of Sims' largest shareholder Allan Gray, said while the trading update was disappointing, it didn't affect his long-term outlook for the company.; 0
0450.00008; It's somewhat emblematic of some of the cyclical headwinds that face a lot of companies, he said.; 0
0450.00009; Mr Mawhinney said he believed trading conditions would normalise over the next five years.; 0
0450.00010; While Mr Field said it was too early to say if the decline in demand would affect the company's second-half results, he also expected the market would recover in the medium-term.; 0
0450.00011; Regardless, our strategy remains sound, and the business is well-positioned to deliver good returns through the commodity cycle, he said.; 0

0451.00001; By Amy Fontinelle  Updated Jun 25, 2019  Table of Contents  Finance remains a male-dominated profession, especially at the top. Women in the United States made up 53 percent of the total labor force in finance in 2017, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But they accounted for only 17 percent of senior-level managers in the investment banking sector in 2015, according to a February 2017 survey by Catalyst Research and the latest data.; 1
0451.00002; Women can be heavily scrutinized or overlooked for positions of power. They are sometimes underestimated, pitted against each other, held to a higher standard, and expected to work harder or achieve more to prove themselves against their male counterparts.; 0
0451.00003; But there are now more opportunities in finance than ever before for women, thanks in large part to women who have pioneered in the field.; 0
0451.00004; If you want to play leadership roles in finance and are looking for models, here are seven women who have achieved great success - often by being willing to stand out, take risks and refuse to accept no for an answer.; 0
0451.00005; Geraldine Weiss, Investment Advisor Geraldine Weiss was one of the first women to make a name for herself in finance and to prove that women could be successful investors.; 0
0451.00006; She learned about investing by reading books, listening to her parents' conversations, and studying business and finance in college. No investment firm was interested in hiring her as more than a secretary, despite her studies.; 0
0451.00007; It was a man's world, and women need not apply, she recalls.; 0
0451.00008; In the face of rejection, she started her own investment newsletter in 1966 at the age of 40. A response to one of her newsletter advertisements read, I can't imagine myself ever taking investment advice from a woman.; 0
0451.00009; Unless you take your advice from a man. To avoid further gender discrimination, Weiss signed her newsletter G. Weiss.; 0
0451.00010; It wasn't until the mid-1970s that she revealed her identity, after achieving a consistently successful track record. Weiss's value-based, dividend-oriented stock-picking strategy outperformed the strategies recommended by other newsletters and has achieved above-average returns even in poor markets.; 0
0451.00011; She published her newsletter, Investment Quality Trends, for 37 years until she retired in 2003.; 0
0451.00012; The newsletter still exists and still follows Weiss's strategy. Muriel Siebert, Brokerage Founder Without ever graduating from college, Muriel Siebert obtained entry-level research positions in finance, eventually made partner and went on to found the brokerage firm Muriel Siebert & Co. in 1967.; 0
0451.00013; The difficult process of getting her firm registered with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) involved numerous rejections from men who declined to sponsor her application and difficulties obtaining the necessary financing to meet the exchange's expensive entrance requirements.; 0
0451.00014; She persevered, and her firm became the first woman-owned member of the NYSE.; 0
0451.00015; It is still the only national, woman-owned brokerage on the exchange.; 0
0451.00016; In 1975, Siebert transformed her company into a discount brokerage, a new concept at the time. This threat to the status quo subjected her to ostracism from Wall Street and near expulsion by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).; 0
0451.00017; But she overcame these challenges, too. Siebert went on to bring her financial expertise to politics, another male-dominated field.; 0
0451.00018; As New York State Banking Department Superintendent from 1977 to 1982, she helped prevent bank failures in a tumultuous market. As a Republican, she also made a bid for a U.S. Senate seat.; 0
0451.00019; Siebert passed away on August 24, 2013.  Abigail Johnson, Investment Advisor Billionaire Abigail Johnson became Chairman and CEO of Fidelity Investments in 2016, after serving as President and CEO since 2014.; 0
0451.00020; She is the daughter of former Fidelity Chairman Edward C. Johnson III and granddaughter of the company's founder.; 0
0451.00021; She owns nearly 25% of the company, and her net worth is estimated at about $11 billion. There is no question that being born into the right family helped Johnson get where she is today.; 1
0451.00022; That said, as one of the largest mutual fund companies with nearly $6.8 trillion in assets under administration, $2.6 trillion of assets under management as of 2018 and a 71-year history, Fidelity has too much at stake to put someone in charge based on name alone.; 0
0451.00023; Johnson earned an MBA from Harvard and worked as a customer service representative, an analyst, and an equity portfolio manager with Fidelity for about a decade before earning her first executive position there. Abby Joseph Cohen, Portfolio Strategist Cohen has been a respected and honored portfolio strategist for decades.; 0
0451.00024; After serving as a Federal Reserve Board economist in 1973, Cohen worked as an economist and quantitative strategist at major financial firms including T. Rowe Price, Barclays, and Drexel Burnham Lambert. She joined Goldman Sachs in 1990, became a partner in 1998. Her positive and accurate forecasts of the 1990s bull market made her a star in finance and media.; 0
0451.00025; Cohen retired in 2018 as Chief Strategist and President of Goldman's Global Market Institute.; 0
0451.00026; But as of 2019, she remains an advisory director and senior investment strategist, as well as a member of the Investment Committee for the firm's U.S. retirement plans.; 0
0451.00027; Cohen has also held prestigious positions with organizations including Cornell University, the Chartered Financial Analyst Institute, Major League Baseball and the Council on Foreign Relations.; 0
0451.00028; She has also found her name on Forbes' Most Powerful Women list that includes women from all professions, not just finances. Lubna S. Olayan, CEO As CEO of Riyadh-based Olayan Financing Company, one of Saudi Arabia's most prominent companies, this Saudi woman is responsible for 50 manufacturing companies and has also been named #59 on Forbes' Most Powerful Women list.; 0
0451.00029; Olayan entered the family business in the early 1980s when it was not common or socially acceptable for Saudi women to work in the business. In fact, it was not and still is not common for Saudi women to work at all, let alone to work in business, because of restrictions on their freedom.; 0
0451.00030; She employs more than 540 women in her company and champions women in the workforce. Like Johnson, Olayan was born into the right family, but she would not be able to run a conglomerate that oversees 50 other companies and is one of the largest investors in the Saudi stock market if she was not intelligent, skilled and determined.; 0
0451.00031; In addition to her high-profile position with Olayan Financing, she became the first female board member of a Saudi public company when she joined Saudi Hollandi Bank in 2004.; 0
0451.00032; She has also been a board member of the investment company Egyptian Finance Company and the investment bank Capital Union. Deborah A. Farrington, Venture Capital Fund Partner Deborah Farrington is a founder and the president of the business financial software company StarVest Management and a partner of the venture capital fund StarVest Partners. Her earlier positions included president and CEO of a private equity investment firm, founding investor and chairman of a successful staffing company and manager with several financial institutions.; 0
0451.00033; Like Johnson, she earned her MBA from Harvard Business School. Farrington is also a director of two public companies: the collectibles authentication company Collectors Universe, Inc., and the business financial software company NetSuite, Inc., both based in California.; 0
0451.00034; In addition, she is a director of several private companies and one nonprofit and has appeared on Forbes' Midas List, a ranking of top venture capitalists. Linda Bradford Raschke, Trader Linda Raschke is president of two financial firms that bear her initials: LBRGroup, Inc., a commodity trading advisor, and LBR Asset Management, a commodity pool operator.; 0
0451.00035; She began trading professionally in the early 1980s and worked as a market maker for stock options.; 0
0451.00036; For six years, she worked at the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange and then the Philadelphia Stock Exchange before becoming a self-employed day trader. Raschke authored a book on high probability trading strategies and has been widely featured in the media.; 0
0451.00037; She has also lectured on trading for a number of prestigious organizations including the Managed Futures Association and Bloomberg. Being a woman in finance means high pressure, but also high visibility.; 0
0451.00038; And women who want to rise through the ranks can make this visibility work in their favor. Many women in finance still face gender discrimination and lower pay for comparable work.; 0
0451.00039; But the barriers are lower and the options are more plentiful today than when Weiss, Siebert, and Cohen entered the field.; 0
0452.00001; Homelessness is a fundamental problem plaguing society because of ineffective government programs.; 0
0452.00002; The government thinks it has the solutions.; 0
0452.00003; Yet the problem continues to grow regardless of which party gets elected. The government is the problem and prevents solutions.; 0
0452.00004; This article will explain why and offer practical solutions to homelessness.; 0
0452.00005; According to Housing and Urban Development (HUD), there were 554,000 homeless people in 2017. A comparably sized city would be Milwaukee.; 0
0452.00006; In 2000, only 4.8% of the homeless population were seniors. By 2030, 24% of the homeless will be seniors. A rise from 5 out of 100 to 1 in 4.; 0
0452.00007; What a sad and staggering statistic!; 0
0452.00008; Government Through the Bureau of Land Management and National Park Service, the government owns 640 million acres of land. The government creates artificial scarcity by hoarding this land.; 0
0452.00009; The government prevents homesteading on the undeveloped land.; 0
0452.00010; We could give a generous 1-acre lot to each homeless person.; 0
0452.00011; The government still has 639.4 million acres of land after releasing a small fraction.; 0
0452.00012; This land is the people's land.; 0
0452.00013; Property Tax Property taxes prevent home ownership. Even if someone paid off their mortgage, they do not completely own their home.; 0
0452.00014; The government charges the homeowner property tax every year to keep their home. If the property taxes are unpaid, the government can seize the house. Senior Eileen Battisti of Beaver County, Pennsylvania lost her home because she failed to pay $6.30.; 0
0452.00015; It was an interest charge added to her account after she paid her property taxes.; 0
0452.00016; Beaver County never informed Eileen about the $6.30.; 0
0452.00017; The government seized her $280,000 home and sold it for $160,000 in foreclosure. Beaver County's top solicitor Joe Askar said, The county never wants to see anybody lose their home, but at the same time the tax sale law, the tax real estate law, doesn't give a whole lot of room for error, either.; 0
0452.00018; Seriously Joe? It was $6!; 0
0452.00019; No room? Eileen took Beaver County to court and lost.; 0
0452.00020; It is unbelievable Beaver County would kick someone out of their house for $6. Imagine how much money Beaver County spent on legal fees for this case!; 0
0452.00021; They could have used the money to help the homeless instead they kicked a senior out of her house that she spent a lifetime paying for!; 0
0452.00022; How sad the government is set up that someone can work hard all their life to pay off their home but end up on the street! Charity In 2018, Americans gave $410 Billion to charity which exceeds the GDP of countries such as Denmark, Norway, and Greece.; 0

0452.00029; Instead of receiving commendation from the city for helping to feed the homeless, he was arrested!; 0
0452.00030; What type of police officer arrests a ninety-year-old man feeding the homeless? In the United Kingdom last year, I gave my left-over dinner to homeless people near where I stayed. I cannot imagine how I would feel arrested for helping another human to not go to bed hungry.; 0

0452.00038; What type of society is the government creating where charity is discouraged and criminalized?; 0
0452.00039; Final Thoughts The various levels of government spent tax dollars on fighting against solutions rather than solving the homelessness problem. Eliminate property tax even if only for seniors.; 0
0452.00040; That one policy could prevent seniors from losing their homes. What type of society forces seniors to keep working to pay property tax to stay in their fully paid home? Government needs to stop interfering when people voluntarily help the homeless.; 0
0452.00041; Let private citizens help the homeless by feeding, building housing units, or letting them sleep on their private land.; 0
0452.00042; We need a wider definition of charity.; 0
0452.00043; No political party or government can solve homelessness.; 0
0452.00044; They had decades to solve it and failed.; 0
0452.00045; It is time for the government to allow private citizens the opportunity to supply workable solutions without penalization.; 0
0452.00046; But that would require the government to admit its incompetence in solving homelessness.; 0

0453.00002; Stop laughing, at least for a couple of minutes.; 0
0453.00003; I know, I know: Andrew Yang is not going to be the Democratic nominee for president in 2020.; 0
0453.00004; He knows that, too.; 0
0453.00005; Yang somehow made the cut to participate in last week's third Democratic debate, clearing the fundraising and polling thresholds the party established in an effort to winnow its presidential field.; 0
0453.00006; But he did little to convince viewers who remained alert throughout that three-hour marathon that he will be a factor in the primaries to come.; 0
0453.00007; So I'm not writing this to suggest that the political oddsmakers should be taking Yang's dark-horse candidacy more seriously, or that Yang would be getting more respect if the average Democratic voter were as farsighted as he is.; 0
0453.00008; I simply want to acknowledge that he is the only candidate talking about an issue that seems likely to loom larger in presidential campaigns to come, and suggest that critics who scoff at his signature proposal for a universal basic income may feel compelled to examine it more closely in the decade ahead  -  especially if Yang's forecast of an artificial intelligence-induced tsunami of unemployment prove prescient.; 0
0453.00009; I find Yang's candidacy interesting not because of his unusual résumé, which includes no prior political experience, but because he has offered what might be the simplest and most useful explanation of how Donald Trump came to be president.; 0
0453.00010; The conventional wisdom, as Yang summarizes it, is that Trump's ascent was the perfect storm spawned by the convergence of racism, Russian cyber-kibitzing and hostility toward Hillary Clinton. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang at the Democratic debate in Houston on Sept. 12, 2019.; 0
0453.00011; His own explanation is simpler.; 0
0453.00012; I'm a numbers guy, Yang said in a recent broadcast of The New York Times' The Daily podcast, and the numbers tell a very clear and distinct story that the reason why he's our president is that we automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs in your home state of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri, Michigan  -  all the swing states you needed to win.; 0
0453.00013; As Yang sees it, that dramatic decline in manufacturing jobs represents only the prelude to a coming unemployment crisis that will leave tens of millions of Americans working in a much broader swath of industries without jobs by the end of the next decade.; 0
0453.00014; My son, a hardworking entrepreneur with only a marginal interest in politics but a keen eye for the zeitgeist, likes to warn me that America's next bloody revolution will come when autonomous vehicles begin supplanting the nation's 3.5 million truck drivers, whose livelihood is the most common occupation in more than half of the 50 states.; 0
0453.00015; Debate flub fest: When will Democrats start judging Joe Biden by his actual words? Yang agrees.; 0
0453.00016; The replacement of drivers will be one of the most dramatic, visible battlegrounds between automation and the human worker, he writes in a recent essay for the Evonomics website.; 0
0453.00017; Companies can eliminate the jobs of call center workers, retail clerks, fast-food workers and the like with minimal violence and fuss. Truck drivers will be different.; 0
0453.00018; If you know anything at all about Yang's quixotic candidacy, it's probably that he proposes to address that crisis by using the proceeds of a value-added tax on corporate profits to bankroll a $1,000-a-month freedom-dividend for every American adult.; 1
0453.00019; The freedom dividend  -  Yang concedes that he adopted that descriptor because it went down easier with voters than its predecessor universal basic income payments  -  is being taken about as seriously as fellow dark-horse Marianne Williamson's proposal to harness love in her campaign to bring about a spiritual transformation of American government.; 0

0453.00023; 2020 isn't the only important election coming Many Democrats, independent voters and disillusioned Republicans see 2020 as the decisive election year in which Americans will either reject Trump and everything he represents once and for all, or condemn us to a permanent state of corruption.; 0

0454.00001; California's pension debt cannot be ignored (iStockphoto)  By Joe Nation |  PUBLISHED: | UPDATED:  A decade ago, at Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's request, I supervised a graduate student team that performed a comprehensive analysis of public pensions in California.; 0
0454.00002; The goal was to calculate California's pension debt, the difference between assets and liabilities. The team's conclusions: the unfunded liability was over $500 billion - seven times the number officially reported. That was in 2008.; 0
0454.00003; The student team recommended several actions to lawmakers and pension managers.; 0
0454.00004; Almost all were ignored.; 0
0454.00005; Over time, it has become clear that the students' analysis was spot on.; 0
0454.00006; Public pension debt doubled to more than $1.052 trillion in 2017, the last year of complete data.; 0
0454.00007; Based on recently-reported public pension assets and estimated liabilities, that figure is now more than $1.109 trillion, an increase of $56 billion. That translates into $81,300 of pension debt per California household.; 1
0454.00008; There are arguments about whether the students use of what economists would call a market basis to measure pension debt is too conservative. In short, a market basis uses accepted economic and finance principles to estimate liabilities.; 0
0454.00009; But even figures reported by California's pension systems on a more optimist actuarial basis produces the same trendline.; 0
0454.00010; Debt per household today is almost $22,800, compared with less than $8,000 when students submitted their work in 2010. What is remarkable about this trend is that pension debt has continued to climb even as the stock market has soared.; 0
0454.00011; The S&P 500 index, about 800 in early 2010, is now over 3,000.; 0
0454.00012; And yet over the last decade, public pension funded ratios, measured by assets divided by liabilities, have moved up only slightly. The funded ratio for California Public Employees' Retirement System's Public Employees' Retirement Fund was 60.8% in 2009.; 0
0454.00013; Now, it's an estimated 72.6%. This, unfortunately, isn't the most alarming news.; 0
0454.00014; No one knows if or when a recession will hit the global or U.S. economies, but we are due.; 0
0454.00015; Another Great Recession-like downturn in the U.S. stock market could push California's public pension system assets from $918 billion today to just over $700 billion. The average funded ratio for all public pensions in California would fall from 75% to 56.4% on an actuarial basis, meaning pensions would have just over 50 cents for every dollar in obligations.; 1
0454.00016; Remember that this is the optimistic scenario.; 0
0454.00017; The average funded ratio on a market basis would fall from 45.7% today to 34.4%, or 34 cents on every dollar owed. Pension debt would climb from $311 billion today to $543 billion on an actuarial basis.; 0
0454.00018; On a market basis, pension debt would climb to $1.341 trillion, or nearly $100,000 per household. A repeat of the Great Recession may be unlikely, but then again, we didn't expect a sharp decline in 2008-2009. Even a mini-recession in which pension systems' assets fall by one-half Great Recession levels would be a horrible development.; 1
0454.00019; Schools and municipal governments, already cutting programs and services despite strong revenues, would be forced to cut even further.; 0
0455.00001; The company's continued drive towards premium products  -  19% of total volumes in CY18 and targeted to reach 30% over the next few years  -  as well as expected savings (3% of PBT) from the master supply agreement (MSA) with parent Ambuja Cement from CY20 bode well for margins.; 0
0455.00002; The 5.9-mtpa cement and 3-mtpa clinker expansion is a key focus area for ACC. Our recent interaction with ACC indicates potential cost benefits would accrue to the company in the wake of declining pet coke prices and increased availability of linkage coal.; 0
0455.00003; Management's focus on completing the 5.9-mtpa cement (3-mtpa clinker) expansion by Q3CY21 offers much-needed volume growth visibility (albeit from CY22 onwards).; 0
0455.00004; With the company likely to be one of the prime beneficiaries of our positive sector hypothesis (of stable demand over medium term, rising industry clinker utilisation and benign fuel cost), we maintain Buy rating on the stock with a TP of Rs 1,846 (at 12x CY20e EV/Ebitda).; 1
0455.00005; Cost relief on the cards  Due to lack of domestic coal availability, ACC's fuel cost/t remained elevated despite global fuel prices (e.g. pet coke and imported coal) spiralling down. However, with increased availability of linkage coal and a further dip in global fuel rates, energy cost is expected to trend down over the ensuing quarters.; 0
0455.00006; Besides, the MSA with Ambuja Cement would yield synergies from CY20 onwards. Capex: Timely completion holds key  The 5.9-mtpa cement and 3-mtpa clinker expansion is a key focus area for ACC.; 0
0455.00007; The company's endeavour is to commission the project by Q3CY21, which will drive robust volume growth in CY22.; 0
0455.00008; The bulk of its new cement capacity coming up in the lucrative central region (4.8 mtpa) is promising.; 0
0455.00009; The capacity expansion also provides much-needed volume growth visibility, which would be a key trigger for the stock.; 0
0455.00010; Outlook: Sector tailwinds intact  We expect pan-India player ACC to be a prime beneficiary of the positive industry fundamentals . We continue to value the stock at 12x CY20e EV/Ebitda and maintain 'BUY/SP'.; 1

0456.00001; SIR John Major will tell the Supreme Court Boris Johnson acted like a dishonest estate agent with ulterior motives as the battle over the Parliament shutdown reaches its final day.; 0
0456.00002; The former PM will deliver a scathing rebuke via his lawyer and claim that Johnson's move to stop MPs from sitting for five weeks was unlawful. Remainer MPs claim that Boris shutdown Parliament to avoid scrutiny over Brexit and push through No Deal  -  but No10 say it was so they can deliver a new domestic legislative agenda in a Queen's Speech.; 0
0456.00003; However, during his submission Sir John will state the government's reason for proroguing makes no sense and cannot be the true explanation. He will add that the court would be artificially naive to accept the PM's reasons for the shutdown, the Times reports. The case is hearing at the highest court in Britain, in front of 11 justices, after judges in Scotland and England delivered contradictory decisions on the shutdown.; 0
0456.00004; A cross party group of 70 MPs won an appeal at the Court of Session in Edinburgh - with judges decided the PM's shutdown was unlawful. But a High Court judge had dismissed a similar challenge by Remainer lawyer Gina Miller and Sir John - leading to the case being brought to the Supreme Court this week.; 0
0456.00005; In his submission Sir John cites a legal case where an estate agent was in breach of fiduciary duty after wrongly claiming a buyer wanted to live in a home when they wanted to sell it on. He said: It could hardly be suggested that the duties of the prime minister to the monarch are less than those of an estate agent to a homeowner.; 0
0456.00006; Accordingly, if the court is satisfied that the prime minister's decision was materially influenced by something other than the stated justification, that decision must be unlawful.; 0
0456.00007; During the battle between two Tory grandees  -  Sir John's lawyer Lord Garnier QC will argue against the government's claim that the shutdown was political and the courts have no jurisdiction. The inference was inescapable that the prime minister's decision was motivated, or in any event substantially motivated, by his political interest.; 0
0456.00008; Lord Garnier will tell the court: Its effect is to deprive parliament of a voice throughout the period of the prorogation. The inference was inescapable that the prime minister's decision was motivated, or in any event substantially motivated, by his political interest in ensuring that there was no activity in parliament during the period leading up to the EU Council summit on 17-18 October.; 0
0456.00009; Yesterday a Remainer lawyer told the court Boris Johnson shut the Mother of Parliaments with the father of lies. Aidan O'Neill alleged that No10's documents on the shutdown should not be taken as the complete truth.; 0
0456.00010; What we have with this prorogation is the mother of parliaments closed down by the father of lies, declared O'Neill, who already won his claim in the Scottish courts.; 0
0456.00011; Lies have consequences but the truth will set us free.; 0
0456.00012; Rather than allow lies to triumph, this court should listen to the angels of its better nature and rule that this prorogation is an unlawful abuse of the power of prorogation which has been entrusted to the government.; 0
0456.00013; Mr O'Neill, who represents the cross party group of 70 MPs and anti-Brexit activists, said the government had proven itself unworthy of trust and said enough is enough.; 0
0456.00014; But Sir James Eadie, for the government, insisted that case law showed it was clear that the suspension was the PM's prerogative the business of politics and nothing to with the Supreme Court.; 0
0456.00015; Sir James also said that opposition MPs had every opportunity to act on prorogation but chose not to use the nuclear weapon of a no confidence vote.; 0
0456.00016; The case continues.; 0
0457.00001; Universal Credit: Who is eligible? How Pension Credit rule change affected some couples 0  17  Universal Credit is replacing six types of benefits, known as legacy benefits. These are Child Tax Credit, Housing Benefit, Income Support, income-based Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA), income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA), and Working Tax Credit.; 0
0457.00002; There are some eligibility criteria to fulfil in order to potentially claim Universal Credit. The Gov.uk website states a person may be able to get Universal Credit if they're on a low income or out of work, 18 or over (there are some exceptions if one is 16 or 17), and live in the UK.; 0
0457.00003; The eligibility rules also state a person must be under state pension age (or their partner is), and the individual and their partner  -  if they have one  -  have £16,000 or less in savings between them. Gov.uk explains that a person and their partner can claim Universal Credit as a couple if one person is under state pension age and eligible for Universal Credit.; 0
0457.00004; When both partners reach state pension age, their Universal Credit claim will stop. Instead, they may then be able to apply for Pension Credit and other benefits as a couple, once their Universal Credit payment stops.; 0
0457.00005; Pension Credit is an income-related benefit which state pension claimants may be able to receive. There are two parts of Pension Credit: Guarantee Credit and Savings Credit. Guarantee Credit tops up one's weekly income if it's below £167.25 for a single person or £255.25 for couples.; 0
0457.00006; The latter payment may be made to people who saved some money towards their retirement, such as a pension however, one may not be eligible for Savings Credit if they reached state pension age on or after 6 April 2016. The state pension age is rising but it's possible to check the earliest age one can start receiving a state pension by using the Check your State Pension age tool on the government website. Read Also Windows 10 alert as Microsoft update is causing a frustrating problem for some users  Eligibility rules changed for Pension Credit claimed by couples back in May this year.; 0
0457.00007; Now, in order to start getting Pension Credit as a couple, both people in the relationship must have reached state pension age.; 0
0457.00008; The rules also state that one person must have reached state pension age and be claiming Housing Benefit for people over state pension age.; 0
0457.00009; To qualify, one must live in England, Scotland, or Wales. People who were already receiving Pension Credit will continue to do so and may only be affected by the changes if their circumstances change and their entitlement stops.; 0
0457.00010; Those affected can instead apply for Universal Credit, until both people are eligible for Pension Credit as a couple under the new rules. Gov.uk states a partner counts as a husband, wife, or civil partner (if one lives with them) or someone else they live with as if they were married.

0459.00002; The Azerbaijan-focused miner achieved total production of 39,905 gold equivalent ounces (GEO) in the six months to 30 June, compared to 37,349 GEO in the year-ago period.; 0
0459.00003; The growth in first-half production resulted in an 8% rise in revenue to US$43.3mln and an 27% jump in pre-tax profit to US$10.3mln.; 1
0459.00004; All-in sustaining cost of gold production came to US$603 per ounce, compared to US$543 per ounce last year, due to an extra US$2.7mln cash costs of mining a higher volume of ore.; 1
0459.00005; Anglo Asian said some of the additional ore mined has been stockpiled for use in 2020, which will reduce costs next year.; 0
0459.00006; For the 2019 financial year, the company expects output of between 82,000 and 86,000 GEOs based on metal prices as of 1 January.; 1
0459.00007; However, the increase in the price of gold and decrease in the price of copper since 1 January 2019 have resulted in one tonne of copper decreasing in value from approximately 4.7 to 3.8 GEOs, said non-executive chairman Khosrow Zamani.; 1
0459.00008; We are on track to achieve our initial production target, but when translated into GEOs at actual metal prices, the FY 2019 forecast outcome is now around the bottom end of the guidance range.; 0
0459.00009; Nevertheless, Zamani said the company remains in an enviable position to continue its progression and deliver on its stated growth strategy. An interim dividend of 3.50 US cents per ordinary share will be paid to shareholders on 31 October, which the company said reflects a strong cash position and low level of debt.; 1
0459.00010; As of 30 June, Anglo Asian had cash of US$20.4mln and debt of US$5.2mln, bringing it to a net cash position of US$15.2mln, compared to US$6.1mln at the end of December.

0468.00007; Investment Adviser at Wisejay Private LimitedBangalore, Karnataka How much control do you have on your investment returns? Or more appropriately, what aspects of your investment you can control to get better return?; 0
0468.00008; In most cases, we cannot really predict the price of the investment or what would be the valuation based on mark to market.; 0
0468.00009; So, what can we control to increase our return (or not to lose money), well, Cost.; 0
0468.00010; The total cost to procure an asset is, in most cases, the only thing we can control which contributes to the return.; 0
0468.00011; So, let us understand the different components of cost. I am not considering capital gains taxes here because capital gains taxes depend on whether or not you made a profit and cannot be controlled by the investor.; 0
0468.00012; COST OF THE SECURITY This cost is often the most transparent.; 0
0468.00013; For a stock, it is the ask price, for a bond it is the quoted price, for a mutual fund, it is the NAV at the time of the purchase.; 0
0468.00014; This is the most important part of your cost and and can be controlled the most.; 0
0468.00015; Why?; 0
0468.00016; We can just choose not to buy a security at a price we are not comfortable with. One way to control the cost is to use a limit order rather than a market order to buy a stock.; 0
0468.00017; DISTRIBUTION COST / BROKERAGE Indian capital markets are broker driven and retail investors cannot make a transaction without using brokers. The brokerage is a significant cost and should not be taken lightly.; 0
0468.00018; So, how can you reduce brokerage charges. Well, one option is choosing a cheaper broker.; 0
0468.00019; But, this is not the most important  part.; 0
0468.00020; The most effective way to reduce brokerage cost is to do less trading.; 0
0468.00021; Each time you are trading the broker makes money, does not matter whether you do.; 0
0468.00022; Now, let us consider the mutual funds.; 0
0468.00023; Many people think that there is not a brokerage for mutual fund. Well, whenever you are opting for a regular plan, you are paying a distribution cost.; 0
0468.00024; This cost is more significant, because even if you do not do trade, the distribution cost is added to the expense ratio and deducted from the value of your mutual fund investment.; 0
0468.00025; SECURITIES TRANSACTION TAX (STT) STT is payable either by the buyer or the seller on transactions on equity and equity oriented funds.; 0
0468.00026; Although, an investor cannot choose whether or not to pay STT, they can minimise this cost by limiting trading. As it appears, a cost of investment can me managed by adopting a buy and hold strategy rather than making frequest trades.; 0

0469.00001; Today, the ECB has actually delivered almost everything that investors wanted. As expected, the deposit rate has been lowered to minus 0.5%.; 1
0469.00002; This measure is accompanied by an allowance for which there is no negative interest.; 0
0469.00003; The purpose of this staggering is to keep the banks' burden from the negative deposit interest rate within limits. This differentiation should make life easier for German, French and Dutch banks in particular.; 0
0469.00004; Together, they account for almost 70% of the ECB's surplus reserves. However, the ECB must ensure that money market rates do not move upwards as a result of this graduated system.; 0

0469.00006; The programme is to be implemented almost until it raises key interest rates again.; 0
0469.00007; Since this can take a very long time, this is a clear signal to the markets that the ECB intends to act very expansively until further notice. The announced purchase volume, on the other hand, is lower than many had hoped.; 0
0469.00008; The limits applicable to individual issues and issuers have not been changed. A monthly volume of EUR 20 billion, however, gives the ECB the opportunity to resume net purchases for at least twelve months, even with the current limits.; 1
0469.00009; Since the ECB assumes that it will not reach an inflation rate of 1.5% until 2021, an end to bond purchases in the next few years is not foreseeable.; 0
0469.00010; ECB boss Draghi himself sees the limits of monetary policy reached. At the press conference, he stressed that it was now time for fiscal policy to play a more active role, especially in those countries that had the leeway to do so.; 0
0469.00011; This appeal is likely to be directed mainly at Germany. There was a short range of joy on the financial markets, but then a new realism quickly prevailed and the profits were relinquished.; 0
0469.00012; I share this view. The measures adopted today should not contribute to a rise in inflation.; 0
0469.00013; Growth momentum should not benefit from this either. Only the call for more fiscal stimulus could have a positive impact on growth.; 0
0469.00014; Taken together, I believe that the ECB has largely reached the end of its possibilities.; 0
0469.00015; The plea for fiscal stimulation is a clear sign of this.; 0
0469.00016; All this is happening in times that are not really crisis-prone. It is time for a thorough review of the monetary policy strategy.; 0
0469.00017; This does not necessarily mean deviating from the very expansive course.; 0

0475.00002; In view of the numerous events that happened within the 2018 Legislative Year, my address today is a concise account of my government's performance during the course of the year.

0475.00008; THE FINANCE AND ECONOMIC SECTOR Madam Speaker, I am proud to report that the country's economic growth has generally strengthened, while inflation has now moderated. For the past two years the economy grew by 4.8% in 2017 and improved to 6.5% in 2018. Balance of payments (BoP) estimates indicate that the current account deficit narrowed to 1.5 percent of GDP in the first half of 2019 compared to a deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP in the corresponding quarter in 2018.; 1
0475.00009; The improvement in the current account balance is attributed to the increase in foreign inflows related to the support from development partners, diaspora remittances, and tourism. Gross international reserves is projected at 4 months of next year's imports of goods and services.; 0
0475.00010; The exchange rate of the dalasi remains broadly stable supported by market confidence, and increased inflows from private remittances, higher receipts from tourism, and official inflows from development partners. Government fiscal operations for the first six months of 2019 indicated that total revenue and grants stood at 9.8 percent of GDP compared to 8.6 percent of GDP in the same period last year. Total expenditure and net lending declined from 11.5 percent of GDP a year ago to 10 percent of GDP in the first part of 2019.; 1
0475.00011; According to the financial soundness indicators, the banking sector remains adequately capitalized, highly liquid and profitable. The ratio of non-performing loans to gross loans declined to 2.3 percent from 2.7 percent a year ago, largely reflecting enhanced credit administration processes and effective loan recovery measures. Private sector credit expanded by 28.8 percent, higher than 20 percent a year ago.; 1
0475.00012; With the private sector expected to play a significant role in financing of the National Development Plan (2018-2021), we have drafted a revision to the Public Private Partnership (PPP) Law with the support of Expertise France and other International Financial Institutions.; 0
0475.00013; As a result, we will submit the bill to the National Assembly for consideration. In the context of the ongoing State Owned Enterprises (SOE) reforms, we are revising the SOE law which is also planned for submission to the National Assembly before the end of the year.; 0
0475.00014; Already, reforms have been initiated within the sector and are progressing very well. Because of the need to review our tax regime the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs will present to this body a taxation Bill, among others for ratification.; 0
0475.00015; 2. EDUCATION Madam Speaker, the education sector continues to be given priority by Government in view of its centrality in the development process.; 0

HIGHER EDUCATION, RESEARCH, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY Madam Speaker, Honourable Members, The Higher Education sector continues to implement various programmes with the primary goal of building the human capital stock of The Gambia. Guided by the 65% Science and Technology turnaround policy, the award of scholarships has been increased for students reading the Sciences, including Medicine.; 1
0475.00018; With external support, during the 2018-19 academic year, 283 students either graduated or had awards at either Master's or Doctoral level.; 0
0475.00019; For the first time, The University of The Gambia (UTG) is now offering a PhD course in Public Administration, in addition to a number of Master's degree programmes and a Bachelor's degree programme in Dentistry.; 0
0475.00020; Under the African Centres of Excellence Impact Project, Government will shortly access Twelve Million US Dollars (US$12,000,000), for infrastructure and capacity development.; 1
0475.00021; Another Three Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars (US$3,500,000) has been secured from UNESCO-KOICA to transform The Gambia Technical Training Institute (GTTI) into a university.; 1

Another development is a new re-entry programme for youths and adults who dropped out of school for one reason or another.; 0
0475.00032; 5. WOMEN, CHILDREN AND SOCIAL WELFARE Madam Speaker, The creation of the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare indicates my government's commitment to addressing the social, economic and general wellbeing of children, women and the socially marginalised members of our society.; 0
0475.00033; The new Ministry signals our awareness of the importance of these members of society. I must observe, however, that issues of women, children, the less privileged and minority groups in the country cannot be addressed in isolation, as they affect the whole of society.; 0
0475.00034; As such, efforts will be intensified to ensure that their rights are protected, and their participation increased in all aspects of development, including appointment to leadership positions.; 0
0475.00035; Our goal is to empower both women and men to live quality lives in an inclusive society free from all forms of violence, neglect and abuse.; 0

0477.00002; (AZO)  by: Quad 7 Capital  Quad 7 Capital  Research analyst, Deep Value, special situations, short-term horizon  Summary  Stock has nearly doubled since we got behind it but we see more room to run. Key indicators remain strong and the name is growing earnings at an amazing rate, fueled in part by an ongoing repurchase program.; 0
0477.00003; We suspect investors used margins as a scapegoat to take profit.; 0
0477.00004; A strong company at a price that is still fair given the growth. AutoZone (AZO) is a name that is a very reliable trade as it ebbs and flows. Still, investors in the name over the longer term are all winners.; 0
0477.00005; We think it is time you became a winner too and bought AutoZone for the longer term.; 0
0477.00006; We have had those who follow our work in the name for over a year. Over at BAD BEAT Investing, we put out a buy alert last year on this stock and said plainly there was a major opportunity in the name under $600.; 0
0477.00007; The stock had about doubled from there, but has now pulled back 100 points from the 52-week highs. We see this as an opportunity to consider getting into the name.; 0
0477.00008; With the company having reported earnings yesterday, we think the future is bright. We see a potential entry point to get back into the name around $1,075.; 1
0477.00009; Several pieces of evidence suggest there is value in this name once again following the sell-off the stock is experiencing.; 0
0477.00010; The company continues its tremendous buyback which ensures additional earnings per share growth over time. We believe that as the stock retraces you should be acquiring shares of this quality company.; 0
0477.00011; We spent a good part of the day yesterday discussing AutoZone and responding to inquiries regarding this report. In our opinion, this sell-off is being driven by fear over gross margin compression and competition.; 0
0477.00012; Let us be clear. We think many are taking profits here, the quarter was strong in many aspects once again.; 0
0477.00013; The company is crushing sales expectations and even exceeding our same-store sales expectations. It is a stock for winners.; 0
0477.00014; We want you in there.; 0
0477.00015; In Q4, AutoZone registered sales of $3.99 billion, which was a 12.1% year-over-year increase, and was a slight beat versus consensus analyst estimates by $60 million.; 0
0477.00016; Sales continue to reliably grow each year:  Source: SEC filings, graphics by BAD BEAT Investing  While sales continue to grow we need to of course have a handle on what is driving these sales. As such we turn to comparable sales which have been on the mend since bottoming out in 2017. This is a critical metric, and we were bullish on comps.; 0
0477.00017; We expected at least 2%, while the Street saw comps of 2.6%.; 0
0477.00018; AutoZone far surpassed expectations here:  Source: SEC filings, graphics by BAD BEAT Investing  This comparable sales beat was way ahead of expectations.; 0
0477.00019; This was a nice rise from last year's Q4 which saw an increase of 2.2% in same-store sales.; 0
0477.00020; After these results, we are projecting for the entire year 2020 ahead comparable sales of 2.75-3.25%.; 1
0477.00021; It is lofty but we think the company is trending in this direction, as the entire year 2019 saw 3.0% comps. We think this is a bullish but realistic range and will be attained. The thing is, compared to even last year, comparable sales are still improving.; 0
0477.00022; While the percentage increase in comparable sales cannot rise forever realistically, the trend is absolutely solid.; 0
0477.00023; Comps still rose 3.0% despite the strength of last year's Q4.; 0
0477.00024; Further boosting the top line is that the company also continues to strategically open new shops to fuel future growth. The company opened 86 net new stores in the U.S. and added another 38 internationally.; 1
0477.00025; With these new store openings, and those opened in the last three quarters, sales should see continued mid-single-digit growth overall, driven by solid comps, in 2020.; 0
0477.00026; Continued sales growth is bullish as the company is reliable on this metric.; 0
0477.00027; We mentioned above that margins may have been an excuse for the Street to sell this quarter.; 0
0477.00028; We think it was a weak point for a company displaying so much growth and valued to such a degree.; 0
0477.00029; Still, it seems the Street was looking for any excuse to take profits.; 0
0477.00030; Margins fell 20 basis points. That is it. We saw gross margins narrow due to lower merchandise margins as a result of the sales mix in the quarter.; 1
0477.00031; While AutoZone's gross margins are pretty stable it has worked hard to cut costs.; 0
0477.00032; Gross margins have generally improved of late but overall operating costs have weighed slightly.; 0
0477.00033; Despite higher occupancy costs operating expenses as a percentage of sales fell to 33.8%. Still, the gross margins are the story here.; 0
0477.00034; Margins came in at 53.4%, down from 53.6%. We think this hiccup triggered sales.; 0
0477.00035; Yet, clearly, margins are strong.; 0
0477.00036; Take a look at the trend the last few Q4s:  Source: SEC filings, graphics by BAD BEAT Investing  Overall, we think this is a petty reason for sales, but we will take the selloff as a gift.; 0
0477.00037; As shareholders our firm is looking to see the company continue to focus on increasing sales while controlling expenses, particularly those impacting gross margins. If it can do this, earnings will not only rise even more, but the stock should react more positively.; 0
0477.00038; Make no mistake, the company continues to have a stellar buyback and we were pleased with the decreasing operational expenses as a percentage of sales. The bottom line is that earnings per share continue to grow nicely.; 0
0477.00039; Speaking of earnings, this is why one invests in a growth company like AutoZone.; 0
0477.00040; We saw higher sales. We saw great (but slightly narrowed) margins.; 0
0477.00041; Operating margin remains solid. And as mentioned, the stellar buyback program continues to help earnings per share.; 0
0477.00042; You see, on the Street, AutoZone is known for having an ongoing buyback.; 0
0477.00043; AutoZone invests most of its excess cash into the buyback program, which we believe is one of the best approaches to building shareholder wealth.; 0
0477.00044; In 2020, we expect AutoZone will continue its buying streak as in Q4, AutoZone invested another $692 million into new purchases at an average price of $1,091 per share. This helped drive EPS to $22.59, smashing estimates by $0.80.; 1
0477.00045; As we look ahead to 2020, we could see the stock earning over $70 per share in fiscal 2020. Incredible.; 0
0477.00046; So we see earnings grew another 30%. We are projecting $70 per share in earnings this year.; 0
0477.00047; Based on the present share price of $1,075, the stock is at just 15 times forward earnings on the high end.; 1
0477.00048; The valuation metrics are attractive. Factoring in the buyback and continued strength, 2019 earnings could grow beyond this if buying ramps up. This continues to be extremely cheap relatively speaking.; 0
0477.00049; We think based on comparable names in the sector, when we look at retail, and when we look at the trading history of AutoZone, the name is still a value buy with this incredible growth.; 0
0477.00050; Its enterprise value to EBIT ratio is an attractive 14.0 on a forward basis, while its price to cash flow is 12x.; 0
0477.00051; As the stock looks to fall back toward $800, AutoZone is on our radar.; 0
0477.00052; Earnings per share growth is phenomenal. We continue to project low single-digit sales increases, mid-2% comp growth, controlled store openings, investments in mobile/online, increasing commercial market share, and of course the killer buyback program. Let the stock fall.; 0

0478.00001; HomeFinance5 Tips to Qualify for a Home Loan on Your First Try  September 21, 2019 ManipalMonk Finance 0  A loan is nothing but a fancy word for debt.; 0
0478.00002; It keeps one indebted to a lender for a long duration.; 0
0478.00003; In case of loans for purchasing a house, one is provided a long tenure, lasting up to 30 years to repay the loan. But qualifying for a high value loan like this is no cakewalk. There are a lot of things you need to do right in order to qualify for the loan.; 0
0478.00004; Here are a few tips that can help you qualify for a home loan on your first try. Ensure you have the required credit scores  CIBIL or credit scores are the prerequisites for getting any loan sanctioned.; 0
0478.00005; This 3 figure score helps lenders access your credit repayment behaviour.; 0
0478.00006; It helps lenders see if you are repaying all your debts be it other loans or credit card debt, on time, without defaulting. As such, it is important that you know your credit scores.; 0
0478.00007; To get a housing loan sanctioned, lenders generally require you to have a credit score of 750 points or higher. If your scores are low, you must improve them before applying for a loan and paying off your existing debts.; 0
0478.00008; If you have the required credit scores, your loan could be approved on your first attempt.; 0
0478.00009; Ensure the credit report is free of errors  The credit report is updated from time to time by the credit bureau.; 0
0478.00010; While you may think that you have the necessary credit scores to apply for home loans , it is better to be on the safe side and check your credit report before beginning the loan application process.; 0
0478.00011; Checking the credit report ensures you have the updated credit scores.; 0
0478.00012; If you find any flaws in the credit report you can get it updated. Remember, lenders check both, the credit scores and the credit report, so it is in your best interest to ensure it is free of any errors. Get pre-approved for the loan  Perhaps the best way to ensure that you house loan is approved on the first attempt is to get preapproved for it.; 0
0478.00013; Getting preapproved for the loan can also help you qualify for the maximum loan amount. Calculating things like the payable EMI and interest rates, finalizing the loan budget and selecting the property you wish to buy, before approaching the lender makes the loan process simple. In fact, if everything is in order, the loan can be disbursed within a few days.; 0
0478.00014; Ensure all your documents are in order  Home loan lenders lay a lot of emphasis on documentation. They ask you to submit an increasingly long list of documents, which includes your personal identification documents, your income proof documents and filed tax returns documents.; 0
0478.00015; You should also ensure that the documents of the property you wish to purchase are in order, to expedite the loan process.; 0
0478.00016; If all documents are in proper shape, your loan can be approved in the first try.; 0
0478.00017; Opt to pay a higher amount down payment  When you opt for a higher amount down payment in your loan application, you are convincing the lender that do not need maximum finance and that you can afford the loan.; 0
0478.00018; This gives the lender confidence in your loan repayment abilities.; 0
0478.00019; A higher down payment amount is one of the best ways to get your loan approved on your first attempt.; 0
0478.00020; As you can see, qualifying for a home loan in India is rather easy. If you follow all of these above mentioned tips, you should be able to get your loan passed on your very first try.; 0

0481.00003; Phil Murphy's administration to release vetting documents related to a tax break NJ Transit CEO earns for raising sheep at his Mendham Township Home.; 0
0481.00004; It's time they step up and actually fix problems instead of attempting to pull the wool over everyone's eyes, said Munoz (R-Union).; 0
0481.00005; Murphy and Corbett owe the truth to taxpayers and every rider stuck on a train or bus why fixing the problem isn't getting undivided attention.; 0
0481.00006; Earlier this week, the New Jersey Globe reported Corbett pays just $900 annually on a 5.5 acres portion of his property because of a tax break granted by the state's Farmland Assessment Act.; 1
0481.00007; Anthony Grieco, the senior vice president for Communications and Customer Service at NJ Transit, told the New Jersey Globe that Corbett's farm tax status was fully vetted at the time of the appointment and found to be in compliance with state law.; 0
0481.00008; News of Corbett's use of the subsidy has drawn fire from groups on either end of the political spectrum. Those from the right have largely focused on the problems that continue to plague NJ Transit, while those from the left have given some attention to the law that enabled Corbett's farm subsidy.; 0
0481.00009; Corbett shows that it's not how you farm land, it's how you farm the government.; 0

It's unclear whether the losses Corbett suffers from raising sheep outweigh the value of the tax break. The fact that he is cutting corners and playing games on his taxes shows why NJ Transit is such a mess, Tittel said.; 0

0482.00001; Bitcoin  by Ashutosh Rimal  7 hours ago  4 minutes read  Hong Kong-based venture capital group CMCC Global launched its Liberty Bitcoin Fund to provide crypto currency access to accredited investors in Asia who are very interested but have been slow to buy the coins directly.; 0
0482.00002; The Liberty Bitcoin Fund is a single-asset passive tracker of Bitcoin and offers services including buying and safekeeping coins.; 0
0482.00003; We have received more and more questions over the years from our existing investor base about whether we could help them buy Bitcoin, Martin Baumann, managing partner of CMCC Global, told CoinDesk.; 0
0482.00004; The new fund is really a demand-driven.; 0
0482.00005; CMCC Global has set up three funds since 2016.; 0
0482.00006; All of the funds are focused on investments in proprietary technical infrastructure such as ethereum network where developers can build applications.; 0
0482.00007; The funds have raised more funding from high net worth individuals, family offices assets and institutional investors over time. The first fund in the CMCC Liquid VC series gathered $1 million while the other two successors received $3.5 million and $30 million.; 1
0482.00008; Baumann said the anchor investor for the third fund is one of the largest family offices in Asia, while declining to reveal the identity of the investor due to privacy and regulatory requirements.; 0
0482.00009; Japanese messaging app Line also invested in the third fund, Baumann added.; 0
0482.00010; The latest fund uses ANXONE Custody, a proprietary digital asset safekeeping system with insured wallets provided by custodian BC Group, a digital asset technology company publicly listed on Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Growing Demand for Digital Asset Class  There is rising demand for cryptocurrencies as an asset class for traditional funds, industry pros said. As digital assets mature and gain recognition, such as being included in mutual funds and ETFs, this volatility should slowly subside, making it a more appropriate investment in multi-asset portfolios, Kostya Etus, portfolio manager at CLS Investments, a money management firm, told CoinDesk.; 0
0482.00011; As digital assets grow to be perceived as a legitimate investment in portfolios, mutual funds have become one of the most accessible ways to own crypto. Investors who prefer not to open accounts specifically for digital assets would be able to purchase mutual funds within their standard brokerage accounts and maintain all of their assets in one place. Etus said.; 0
0482.00012; While cryptocurrencies might not be as stable as traditional asset classes including fixed income and equity, Etus pointed out their price movements tend to be non-correlated with other asset classes, increasing the diversification benefit of adding crypto to already diversified portfolios. Despite the benefits, volatility in digital assets such as Bitcoin is very high, sometimes moving more in one day than some asset classes do in years, Etus said. This extreme volatility may be dangerous and detrimental to portfolio returns.; 0
0482.00013; In addition, the Asia Pacific region remains one of the most deep pocketed area, with investors eager to invest across asset classes. According to a PwC report in January, assets under management in the Asia-Pacific region are expected to grow from $15.1 trillion in 2017 to $16.9 trillion in 2020, and then nearly double to $29.6 trillion by 2025, a total compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.7%.; 1
0482.00014; Limited Access in Asia  Crypto investment in Asia is less common than you'd think. If you are a billionaire in Hong Kong or anywhere in the world, you don't get a ledger and tell your analyst to buy some Bitcoin for you, and then he runs away with it. That's just doesn't work, Baumann said.; 0
0482.00015; CMCC is launching its Liberty Bitcoin Fund with the ambition to provide digital asset management services in Asia to be on par with Grayscale in the U.S., Baumann said.; 0
0482.00016; Investors needed a regulated outfit in which they could invest, something like Grayscale in New York, Baumann said.; 0
0482.00017; What we're doing here is a similar story. When the company started to invest in digital assets in 2016, it had a hard time to find basic services such as auditing and fund administration, which would have been easy for an equity or a fixed income fund. These things did not exist.; 0
0482.00018; If you approached a fund administrator, they would not work with you because they wouldn't work with digital asset companies or crypto companies, Baumann said.; 0
0482.00019; Or if you approached the bank, you're having a hard time getting a bank card.; 0
0482.00020; You need auditors, you need a licensed fund administrator, you need to have professional care. he said. We need an anti-money laundering people, and amongst others you need to have a professional custodian.; 0

0483.00001; Science News Date: Summary: Ocean-based actions have greater potential to fill in gaps in climate change mitigation than previously appreciated. Share: FULL STORY Ocean-based actions have greater potential to fill in gaps in climate change mitigation than previously appreciated, an Oregon State University scientist and two co-authors explain in a paper published today in Science. advertisement The article by OSU distinguished professor Jane Lubchenco and her collaborators aims to connect the dots between two new international reports, one highlighting the devastating impact of climate change on the ocean, the other an analysis of ocean-related solutions to climate change.; 0
0483.00002; The paper by Lubchenco and the reports by the International Panel on Climate Change, issued today in Monaco and New York, and the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy, released Tuesday in New York at a meeting Lubchenco presided over, are among the key elements of international Climate Week.; 0
0483.00003; Climate Week began Sept. 20 and includes marches and other activities around the world, with a focus on the United Nations and other sites in New York.; 0
0483.00004; The key takeaway of the reports and the paper, Lubchenco said, is that we can now think of the ocean as a source of solutions, not just a victim of climate change.; 0
0483.00005; It is clear that the ocean has been bearing the brunt of climate change to date, but untapped ocean-related approaches to fighting climate change could play a large role in capping climate change at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-Industrial Age levels as called for in the 2016 Paris Agreement.; 1
0483.00006; Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees would maintain substantial proportions of ecosystems while also benefiting health and economies, scientists say.; 0
0483.00007; advertisement The IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere paints a gloomy picture of the impacts of climate change on the ocean, ocean ecosystems and people, and an even more dismal portrayal of what is in store unless we get serious about reducing greenhouse gas emissions rapidly, said Lubchenco, a marine ecologist in the OSU College of Science and a former administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.; 0
0483.00008; But the new analysis conducted for the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy concludes that ocean-based activities have significant potential to help us actually reach the 1.5-degree Celsius target by 2050 -- much greater potential than anyone realized. Lubchenco, one of the world's most highly cited ecologists with expertise in the ocean, climate change and interactions between the environment and human well-being, was not directly involved in writing the IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate.; 0
0483.00009; She is, though, among the scheduled speakers today in New York at a press briefing, an event being called Blue Leaders: Call to Action on Ocean and Climate. Other speakers include heads of state and 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.; 0
0483.00010; This week's other key report, the one organized by the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy, analyzes five categories of ocean-based activities to evaluate their potential to reduce, sequester and store emissions. The categories are ocean-based renewable energy ocean-based transport protecting and restoring marine ecosystems (especially blue carbon ecosystems like mangroves, salt marshes and seagrass beds) shifting diets to include more protein from seafood and less land-animal protein and storing carbon in the seabed.; 0
0483.00011; advertisement The report concludes that the first four of those can be deployed right away, but seabed carbon storage will require additional research, said Lubchenco, who co-chaired the expert group that advises the panel and oversaw the report. Combined, there is the potential for ocean-based activities to provide as much as 21% of the emission reductions needed to achieve the 1.5-degree target by 2050.; 0
0483.00012; That means in addition to the options for reducing emissions that we already knew about, we now have some new and powerful tools to deploy. The High Level Panel features 14 heads of state who work together to adopt and promote policies and practices associated with a sustainable ocean economy. Led by the leaders of Norway and Palau, the panel also has representation from Portugal, Ghana, Namibia, Kenya, Chile, Mexico, Jamaica, Canada, Japan, Indonesia, Fiji and Australia.; 0
0483.00013; Collectively, those nations represent 30% of the world's coastlines and ocean territories, 20% of the fisheries' catches, and 20% of the shipping, Lubchenco said.; 0
0483.00014; This report is the first from the group 16 others will follow.; 0
0483.00015; Along with its report, the High Level Panel also released a Call to Ocean-Based Climate Action, challenging nations, businesses and society in general to adopt or promote activities that will help achieve the 1.5-degree goal.; 0
0483.00016; The call includes six types of actions: investing in nature-based climate solutions harnessing ocean-based renewable energy decarbonizing ocean industries securing sustainable food for the future advancing the deployment of carbon capture and storage and expanding ocean observation and research. The report from the International Panel on Climate Change basically says, 'the problem is bad and likely to get much worse unless we act' the High Level Panel report says, 'here's what we can do, it will matter, and take hope,' Lubchenco said.; 0
0483.00017; Our paper in Science aims to connect the dots between those two. The Earth has already warmed by 1 degree Celsius, sea levels have risen more than 8 inches since 1880, Arctic sea ice is declining at the fastest rate in 1,500 years, and extreme weather events are becoming more common and damaging. The actions the High Level Panel calls for are ambitious, Lubchenco said, but we argue that they are necessary, could pay major dividends toward closing the emissions gap in coming decades, and achieve other co-benefits along the way.; 0
0483.00018; Joining Lubchenco as co-authors are Ove Hoegh-Guldberg of the University of Queensland and Eliza Northrop of the World Resources Institute.; 0
0483.00019; They write that for far too long, the ocean has been mostly absent from policy discussions about reducing carbon emissions and meeting the challenges of climate change.; 0
0483.00020; Ocean-based actions provide increased hope that reaching the Paris Agreement of 1.5 degrees C might be possible, along with addressing other societal challenges.; 1

0484.00001; News  written by Damilare Salami September 25, 2019  Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, has described some of the critics of the federal government's borrowings as backward economists.; 0
0484.00002; In July, the Debt Management Office (DMO) released figures which showed that Nigeria's debt increased by N560 billion in the first quarter of 2019. According to the DMO, the total debt stock as of March 31, 2019, stood at N24.9 trillion compared to the N24.3 trillion as of December 31, 2018.; 0
0484.00003; The breakdown showed that the total external debt stood at N7.8 trillion ($25.6 billion) while domestic debt was N17 trillion ($55.6 billion). But speaking during a meeting at the Lagos Business School (LBS), Fashola said some economists who could not run small businesses successfully had been harsh on the government for borrowing to finance infrastructure projects in the country.; 0
0484.00004; Today, the government is constructing roads in every state of Nigeria and while revenues are a challenge to prompt completion, some experts who have not successfully shown they can run a small business moan the loudest about Nigeria's borrowing to fund infrastructure investment, he said.; 0
0484.00005; A Nigerian has borrowed billions of dollars to build a refinery, petrochemical plant, fertiliser plant and gas processing plant, yet some backyard economists complain that a country whose population is in the hundreds of millions is borrowing too much to fix rail, roads, ports (air and sea) and power.; 0
0484.00006; They come to the public space to talk about the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and infrastructure of the United States and OECD (Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development) countries. But they are ominously silent on America's public debt that exceeds $21 trillion. He said a lot of Nigerians go on holidays to places like the US for medical treatment, seek for their citizenship, fly their aeroplanes and use their airports but unknowingly pay in part for the debt these countries have incurred for building the infrastructure they enjoy.; 0
0484.00007; He challenged business students at the LBS to seize the public space from those half-baked economists and enlighten the public about the necessity to invest before you can claim a dividend.; 0
0484.00008; He said federal roads such as the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, Apapa-Oworonshoki expressway, Ikorodu-Sagamu and Lagos-Badagry were built about four decades ago and have outlived their design lives. What we now hear is the inconvenience, instead of the acknowledgement that government is now responding and providing the service we all craved for almost two decades, he said.; 0
0484.00009; Please be aware that all those roads under construction are now construction sites and, in the world that we now live in, safety on construction sites is now a big issue. Not only for motorists who have to drive through them but also for our brothers and sisters who are working there to deliver the infrastructure we desperately crave.; 0
0484.00010; A camera sees only what the man behind the lens wants it to see. So, instead of inconvenience, I see service, with the hope that things will get better.; 0
0484.00011; On the widespread kidnappings, the minister said: I make the point that this is not a novel crime in Nigeria.; 0
0484.00012; From when I was a child, we were reminded by our parents about the threats of kidnappers.; 0
0484.00013; So, what we have is a crime pattern that has come back to the front burner while cases of armed robbery at homes and banks seem to have taken a back burner. The question I urge all of us to ask is why has it come back? Is organised crime gathering more momentum?; 0
0484.00014; Is the presence of police in deterring bank robberies forcing organised criminals to re-think and re-strategize? Is the gradual reduction of cash at homes and on our persons, through greater use of bank cards and electronic wallets, making home attacks less rewarding and profitable?; 0
0484.00015; Simply put, are the criminals saying to us, if we cannot rob a bank or a home for cash, why not seize the owner of the cash (hostage-taking) and get their people to bring the cash to us? If this is the case, what are we doing or going to do about it?; 0
0484.00016; We should seriously consider and effect lifestyle changes that avoid the obscene display of wealth which makes us vulnerable as potential victims.; 0

0485.00001; Wednesday, 25 September 2019 Human Rights Watch reports on lead poisoning at Kabwe, Zambia.; 0
0485.00002; Lead, zinc, and vanadium mining in the city of Kabwe (formerly Broken Hill) in Central Province, Zambia, began under the Rhodesian Broken Hill Development Company in 1904, when the area was under British Rule, with concerns about the toxicity of the industry first being raised in 1916. The mines were acquired by the South African mining company Anglo American, who continued to run the industry through independence in 1964, until the industry was nationalised in 1970.; 0
0485.00003; Mining at Kabwe was controlled by the state-run Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Limited until 1994, when the mines were deemed to be unprofitable and were closed down. Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Limited was subsequently privatised, with the government-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Investment Holdings taking over liability for environmental issues at sites it owned, and its assets (including the right to carry out further mining) being sold off.; 0
0485.00004; Decades of lead mining have taken a severe toll on the environment at Kabwe, with soil in the area contaminated with lead, wind blown dust with a high level of lead affecting much of the city, and high levels of lead found in crops and livestock grown in the area, surface waters and shallow wells, as well as in the blood of many people living in the city.; 0
0485.00005; In a report published on 23 August 2019 the international organisation Human Rights Watch lays out the problems faced by the local community in Kabwe due to the presence of lead pollution from the former mines, as well as the failures of previous remediation measures to address this problem, and make proposals as to what steps can be taken to alleviate the ongoing problem of lead pollution in Kabwe.; 0
0485.00006; Lead is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans when ingested or inhaled. The WorldHealth Organization maintains that there is no known safe level of lead exposure.; 0
0485.00007; Elevated lead levels damage the brain, kidneys, liver, stomach, nerves, and blood cells, which may result in anaemia, IQ deficits, reduced attention span, reading and learning disabilities, behavioural problems, hearing loss, impaired growth and visual and motor functioning, anaemia, high blood pressure, coma, convulsions, or death. Lead poisoning can often go undetected, as it may not manifest in obvious symptoms. Children are especially at risk because they are more likely to ingest lead dust when playing in the soil, their brains and bodies are still developing, and they absorb four to five times as much lead as adults.; 0
0485.00008; The consequences for children who are exposed to high levels of lead and are not treated include reading and learning barriers or disabilities behavioural problems impaired growth anaemia brain, liver, kidney, nerve, and stomach damage coma and convulsions and death. After prolonged exposure, the effects are irreversible. Lead also increases the risk of miscarriage and can be transmitted through both the placenta and breastmilk.; 0
0485.00009; In the early 1970s an outbreak of children suffering from convulsions and comas in the Kasanda suburb of Kabwe was found to have been caused by lead poisoning, the children were given chelation therapy (a chemical process in which a synthetic solution, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, which binds to the metals and then can be excreted, is injected into the bloodstream to remove heavy metals and/or minerals from the body), despite which four of them died. This prompted a study by AJL Clark of the University of London, which found high lead levels in the soil, air, and vegetation in Kasanda, Chowa, and Makululu, and elevated blood lead levels in infants, children, and new mothers. Clark tested over 600 children in Chowa, Kasanda, and Makululu and 125 newborn infants and their mothers in Kasanda, and found a direct correlation between high blood lead levels in newborns and their mothers.; 0
0485.00010; Lead levels in soil were found to be as high as 9400 parts per million, compared to the 400 parts per million considered to be a maximum safe level for soil in areas where children play by the US Environmental Protection Agency.; 0
0485.00011; In the 1990s Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines carried out a series of studies into both soil lead concentrations and lead levels in blood, finding high concentrations of lead in both soil and blood samples. This was followed by a program which administered chelation therapy, provided clean topsoil to households in Chowa to cover the contaminated soil, and gave families tips for reducing lead exposure in the home.; 0
0485.00012; A subsequent environmental assessment carried out on behalf of the World Bank found that this program was 'fraught with problems', 'inadequate for the need', and 'the absolute minimum that could be considered adequate', noting that the clean topsoil had already begun to erode in some areas, re-exposing the lead-contaminated soil.; 0
0485.00013; Between 2003 and 2011 the World Bank-funded Copperbelt Environment Project undertook a number of steps to address the lead pollution in Kabwe, though this too was hampered by the lack of a comprehensive remediation program, and therefore achieved only limited results. The project cleaned the Kabwe Canal to reduce the risk of lead recontamination through seasonal flooding, removed mine waste material from some residential areas, and removed topsoil and planted grass and trees in the yards of 3100 households.; 1
0485.00014; It also planted grass at schools, including those closest to the mine plant area and others in Kasanda, Makandanyama, Mutwe Wansofu, Makululu, and Luangwa, and built new water infrastructure and subsidised water rates to make it less difficult for residents to maintain the new vegetation. The project also supported an Integrated Case Management program, which conducted blood lead testing of about 5000 children below age 7 at local health centres and provided treatment (nutritional supplements - including milk, soya, and blood tonic - or chelation therapy) to about 2800 of the children tested. After the project ended Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Investment Holdings continued to administer blood tests to children under seven until 2016, when the test kits ran out, though by this time there was no chelation therapy available for children with high levels of lead in their blood, and cleanup efforts to reduce the environmental threat had also stopped, and with it any hope of reducing children's ongoing exposure to lead.; 0
0485.00015; In May-June 2012, researchers at the University of Zambia, Hokkaido University, and the Zambian Ministry of Health conducted blood lead testing of 246 children under age 7 at health centres in Chowa, Kasanda and Makukulu and found 'alarming' levels of lead in the children's blood.; 0
0485.00016; All of the children were found to have unsafe levels of lead in their blood, with eight children found to have lead at levels at which about half of children would be expected to die or have seizures or comas. In 2016 the Japan International Cooperation Agency launched five-year research project intended to identify the environmental, health, and socioeconomic effects of lead in Kabwe, as well as possible remediation strategies, which aims to blood lead testing of select children and adults in Kabwe, aiming to test four family members each from 25 households in each of Kabwe's 40 census areas, and will oversee the blood lead testing that occurs under the government's new World-Bank funded project.; 0
0485.00017; In the same year the Zambian Government and World Bank launched the Zambia Mining and Environmental Remediation and Improvement Project, which aims to address environmental health risks in highly polluted areas in Kabwe and Copperbelt Province, though as yet this project has taken no action.; 0
0485.00018; In June and November 2018, Human Rights Watch visited five townships in Kabwe where children have been found to have elevated blood lead levels Chowa, Makululu, Waya, Railway, and Katondo.; 0
0485.00019; They interviewed parents and guardians of children with elevated lead levels to find out what kind of cleanup, testing, and treatment efforts the government had carried out in the years after 2011.; 0
0485.00020; They also interviewed local education officials, school headteachers, teachers, and students to learn about the extent of government efforts to examine contamination in schools and to ensure quality, inclusive education for children with disabilities, as well as small-scale miners at the site of the former Kabwe mine about the hazards of their work, the precautions they take to reduce lead exposure, and their reasons for seeking a livelihood there.; 0
0485.00021; Finally, they asked community members, including children, what they would like the government to do to address the lead contamination, especially in light of the current World Bank-funded government project.; 0
0485.00022; Three girls play the game isolo on the ground in the lead-affected township of Waya in Kabwe.; 0
0485.00023; Soil is the main source of lead exposure in Kabwe.; 0
0485.00024; Zama Neff/Human Rights Watch. Human Rights Watch found that the remediation model of grass planting at homes and schools proved unsustainable when the project ended, and dust from unpaved roads remained an environmental hazard, and that government's efforts to reduce lead exposure since 2011 largely consisted of sharing dust reduction tips that community members struggled to carry out. Government testing and treatment efforts were limited and inconsistent in the years since 2011.; 0
0485.00025; Government-run health facilities in Kabwe had no chelation medicine or lead test kits in stock, and there was no health database set up to track cases of lead-related hospitalisation or death.; 0
0485.00026; Inclusive education is a country-wide challenge in Zambia, and in Kabwe, the disability screening process does not even investigate lead-related causes. Finally, large waste piles at the site of the old mine and ongoing small-scale mining both continue to pose health risks.; 0
0485.00027; The interviews found that many children had been tested and found to have high blood lead levels, but that treatments such as chelation therapy were not available, so that most were simply offered nutritional supplements, and returned to the areas where they were being exposed to lead. Many such children were suffering from long term health conditions, as well as facing problems at school relating to poor memory and short attention spans, both symptoms of lead poisoning.; 0
0485.00028; The most recent program of soil analysis in the area was carried out in 2014 by 2014 the international nongovernmental organisation Pure Earth, and found dangerously high levels of lead in the soil of Kasanda, Chowa, Makululu, and Mutwe Wansofu townships.; 0
0485.00029; Other townships where children have shown high blood lead levels, such as Waya, Katondo, and Railway were not included, due to the limited scope of the study.; 0
0485.00030; The townships of Chowa, Kasanda, Makandanyama, and Makululu are home to 76 000 people, including 39 000 children, 13 000 of them under the age of five. It is estimated that 95% of the children in these townships have elevated lead levels in their blood, with 50% being at a level that should be considered for chelation therapy. Human Rights Watch found 60 children in these townships that had been diagnosed with elevated blood lead levels since 2011, with most being offered only nutrition supplements as a treatment, and showing ongoing symptoms consistent with lead poisoning.; 0
0485.00031; Rather than adopt a comprehensive remediation program, the government's measures so far have relied on grass planting at homes and schools, some topsoil replacement, and community education on dust reduction. The government's focus on grass-planting as a remediation measure proved to be unsustainable.; 0
0485.00032; The government has also failed to address other sources of lead contamination, including road dust.; 0
0485.00033; As a result, tens of thousands of families are still exposed to lead on a daily basis.; 0
0485.00034; Residents continue to be exposed to high levels of lead in Kabwe, revealing the inadequacies of past remediation efforts. Lead can be found in the soil in people's yards in the areas around the former Kabwe mine, as well as dust outside and within homes.; 0
0485.00035; Given the extent of contamination, all residents of Kabwe's affected townships are at risk of ingesting or breathing in lead dust.; 0
0485.00036; Resident who grow crops in contaminated soil or cook outdoors face additional risks.; 0
0485.00037; During the dry season from roughly May to October, lead dust represents a particularly significant hazard for those who ingest or inhale it When Human Rights Watch visited affected townships in Kabwe, dust was ubiquitous. In one family's backyard, a rooster shook its wings and became enveloped in a cloud of dust.; 0
0485.00038; Dust stuck to children's hands, faces, and clothes as they played outside on the ground.; 0
0485.00039; Passing cars and trucks left a thick haze in their wake.; 0
0485.00040; Although dust is a hazard in all of Kabwe's contaminated townships, the threat is particularly acute in the informal settlements of Makululu and Waya, where housing is much more exposed to the outdoors than in the formal settlements of Chowa and Kasanda.; 0
0485.00041; As a result, children in these neighbourhoods are likely to encounter more dust in their homes. Clothes hang to dry near a residence in the lead-affected township of Makululu in Kabwe.; 0
0485.00042; Zama Neff/Human Rights Watch. Since 2011 Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Investment Holdings staff have continued to conduct home visits intended to share tips with parents and guardians for reducing lead exposure.; 0
0485.00043; But the suggested measures, such as watering grass and washing floors and hands regularly, only provide limited protection against lead. In addition, families have struggled to implement these recommendations. Many of the families who spoke to Human Rights Watch said they could not afford the water necessary to maintain grass or clean their homes regularly, making re-exposure to contaminated soil and dust inevitable.; 0
0485.00044; Lead contamination in Kabwe therefore has a disproportionate impact on the poor for at least three reasons: undernourishment increases the amount of lead the body absorbs, lead dust is a particular hazard in informal settlements, and the water required to maintain grass and reduce dust is expensive. 19 community members whom Human Rights Watch interviewed identified the lack of affordable water as an impediment to reducing lead exposure.; 0
0485.00045; These community members identified water access as a challenge regardless of whether they relied on running water, communal taps, or well water.; 0
0485.00046; A man who had three grandchildren with elevated lead levels observed that people needed water to keep grass alive and said, 'Right now the cost of water is higher than electricity….; 0
0485.00047; It's horrible. Charges are too high.'; 0
0485.00048; Other parents and grandparents echoed these concerns. A grandmother said she had been told to sprinkle water when sweeping, but it was hard to do. When she used more water, the bill would rise steeply.; 0
0485.00049; Other models for home remediation do not depend on water and are therefore more likely to last in Kabwe.; 0
0485.00050; A pilot project by Pure Earth and Environment Africa in Chowa combined environmental assessment, yard remediation, house cleaning, community education, and drainage improvements.; 0
0485.00051; The yard remediation and house cleaning were voluntary programs, involving the covering of the yard with a barrier cloth and clean soil and then the cleaning of the home with a specialised vacuum.; 0
0485.00052; Meanwhile, in Zamfara State, Nigeria, remediation efforts that addressed lead contamination from mining activity focused on removing lead-contaminated soil from residential areas altogether and replacing it with clean soil.; 0
0485.00053; Kabwe's contaminated townships include public and private schools, play areas, health centres, parks, soccer fields, markets, and places of worship.; 0
0485.00054; Past government efforts to clean up public spaces focused on rehabilitating areas where children spend the most time, namely schools and play parks. Neither effort proved successful, however.; 0
0485.00055; The project planted grass at schools but did not take any sustainable measures to contain the contamination.; 0
0485.00056; The project created new, lead-free play parks for children, but nine out of eleven were vandalised.; 0
0485.00057; From 2015-2016, Samuel Mutiti, a geologist at Georgia College took soil samples at eight Kabwe schools.; 0
0485.00058; The only school for which data is currently public is David Ramushu Combined School in Kasanda, where Mutiti found the school grounds to be so contaminated that he and subsequently began a crowd-funded project that organised independent remediation efforts. Part of his remediation plans involved grass planting, but he told Human Rights Watch that the cost of water would not be an issue because the school had its own borehole, and he would help them design an irrigation system to utilise it.; 0
0485.00059; Human Rights Watch spoke with headteachers at four other schools in or near the contaminated areas. None of them knew whether their schools were contaminated.; 0
0485.00060; They expressed concern about the hazards of lead and said they would appreciate information on soil levels so that they could ensure a safe learning environment for their students.; 0
0485.00061; Playing in Kabwe comes with risks.; 0
0485.00062; Children cannot be sure of avoiding lead exposure in their own yards, streets, or schools.; 0
0485.00063; Given the extent of contamination in the townships around the old mine site, children in those areas lack safe spaces to play.; 0
0485.00064; Small children have increased hand-to-mouth activity, which makes them particularly vulnerable to ingesting lead soil or dust when they play outside. Children play in a backyard in the lead-affected township of Chowa in Kabwe. Juliane Kippenberg/Human Rights Watch.; 0
0485.00065; Unregulated access to the former mine site further endangers children.; 0
0485.00066; Intrigued by the massive pile of mine waste, children play there and have done so for decades.; 0
0485.00067; In 2002, a government-commissioned environmental assessment noted that two boys had drowned in the past year after going to play in one of the mine pits filled with water.; 0
0485.00068; At the time, Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines had built a wire fence around the pit, but people had stolen it.; 0
0485.00069; Nearly two decades later, children continue to play on the site.; 0
0485.00070; Human Rights Watch spoke to a group of 13 elementary school students, of whom three said they played at the Black Mountain tailings dump.; 0
0485.00071; One boy said he slid down the mountain, acknowledging that it was fun but also dangerous. In another Human Rights Watch meeting with eleven older children, seven said they had played at the Black Mountain when they were younger. Soil sampling was carried out at Chowa Health Centre in 2017.; 0
0485.00072; The health centre, which included a new maternity wing that housed pregnant and breastfeeding mothers, had soil lead concentrations that far exceeded safe levels. There is no other public data on soil lead concentrations at health centres, but Kasanda Clinic and Mine Hospital are both located within townships found to have extremely high soil lead levels as recently as 2014.; 0
0485.00073; In 2017, an environmental health expert conducted soil sampling at Chowa Health Centre, pictured here, which revealed soil lead concentrations that far exceeded safe levels, ranging from 1,241 ppm to 13,843 ppm, well above the international standard of 400 ppm.; 0
0485.00074; Zama Neff/Human Rights Watch. Environmental remediation experts have long identified road dust as a significant contamination risk in Kabwe's affected townships.; 0
0485.00075; As early as 1996, a study emphasised the value of reducing road dust to reduce lead exposure pathways.; 0
0485.00076; The government's Road Development Agency has had plans to pave roads in Chowa and Makululu since 2013, but the project has stalled for lack of funds. Unpaved roads in Kabwe's contaminated townships can be found throughout the residential areas.; 0
0485.00077; So long as roads remain unpaved, road dust risks undermining any new remediation efforts.; 0
0485.00078; Despite international guidance that children with elevated blood lead levels should receive monitoring and repeat testing, and despite the widespread lead contamination found throughout Kabwe, lead testing itself has not been consistently available. Several thousand children under 7 were tested from 2011-2016.; 0
0485.00079; Children were tested either at local health centres or at the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Investment Holdings laboratory adjacent to Mine Hospital.; 0
0485.00080; They came from the townships surrounding the former Kabwe mine, including Chowa, Kasanda, Makululu, Makandanyama, Mutwe Wansofu, Waya, Katondo, and Railway.; 0
0485.00081; All of these townships were found to include at least some children with elevated blood lead levels. Under the program, parents and guardians were not told their child's precise blood lead level, only a class from 1 to 5. They were told orally and were not given anything in writing further explaining the lead level.; 0
0485.00082; Despite the widespread need for testing and treatment, Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Investment Holdings ran out of test kits in 2016.; 0
0485.00083; As a result, most children born after 2016 were never tested for lead. Given that the government's testing and treatment programs from 2007-2016 only targeted children below the age of 7, many adults, including pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, never had access to free, government-funded testing.; 0
0485.00084; Human Rights Watch could not find any steps being taken to prevent mother-to-child transmission of lead during pregnancy or breastfeeding.; 0
0485.00085; If no solid efforts were in fact underway, it would be of particular concern given that a government-commissioned study found that 48% of women of childbearing age had high blood lead levels, and that the practise of geophagia (soil ingestion) among pregnant women is common.; 0
0485.00086; Most of the children with lead exposure whose parents or guardians Human Rights Watch interviewed have not had access to proper treatment, due to a lack of chelation medicine and limited stocks of nutritional supplements, such as milk, soya, and blood tonic. Even when treatment has been provided, treatment efforts have been fraught with problems.; 0
0485.00087; Without ongoing cleanup, no treatment program can effectively reduce lead poisoning because patients will be immediately re-exposed.; 0
0485.00088; The testing and treatment program no longer included chelation medicine after 2011. Human Rights Watch could not find a single individual who received chelation through a government program after 2011. According to Ministry of Health officials and hospital staff, chelation medicine is not currently available at either of Kabwe's two public hospitals.; 0
0485.00089; Since 2011 children under 7 who were found to have elevated lead levels were given either milk and soya or a vitamin syrup called Vard's Blood Tonic, or a combination of both.; 0

0485.00091; After the initial provision, distribution of nutritional supplements was erratic or eventually ended.; 0
0485.00092; Parents or guardians for more than 40 children told Human Rights Watch that their children initially received milk, soya, and/or blood tonic in response to elevated blood lead levels. Some families reported being given nutritional supplements when they were first tested that were discontinued without being told why. Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Investment Holdings advised parents to buy milk and soya themselves, but some parents and guardians told Human Rights Watch they could not afford to buy these items regularly or at all.; 0
0485.00093; Although there are limited records of children's hospitalisation and death from lead poisoning in the early 1970s, there are no recent records.; 0
0485.00094; Zambia's Health Management Information System, a national health database, does not track such cases, and local health authorities have not set up any parallel system to collect and analyse data on lead poisoning.; 0
0485.00095; Human Rights Watch interviewed one mother whose son had extremely elevated lead levels at age 4 and died four years later, but there was no way to determine whether lead exposure played any role in his death.; 0
0485.00096; In December 2016, the Zambian government launched a five-year World Bank-funded project, the Zambia Mining and Environmental Remediation and Improvement Project.; 0
0485.00097; Human Rights Watch is concerned, however, that the project will not address the full scope of lead poisoning and contamination. Over two years after its launch, the project remains in the planning stages, in part a result of bureaucratic delays relating to secondment (the temporary reassignment of officials to new, project-related positions) and project restructuring. Officials in the Ministry of Mines and Minerals Development attributed the delays to several factors, including bureaucracy within both the Zambian government and the World Bank and the rules of public procurement.; 0
0485.00098; In response to the delays, the World Bank rated overall implementation progress 'Moderately Unsatisfactory' in its June 2019 Implementation Status & Results Report.; 0
0485.00099; The delays, compounded by what some community members described as the government's poor information sharing and community engagement, have caused frustration and distrust among residents. Zambian government officials and World Bank representatives told Human Rights Watch that the government intended to commence the remediation and health components of the project before the end of 2019.; 0
0485.00100; In July 2018, the Kabwe Municipal Council issued a request for bids for the engineering design for the remediation program, suggesting that it would focus on households in Chowa and Kasanda as well as other 'contaminated hotspots with lead-bearing material'. The Council's stated objective was to decrease soil lead levels in areas where surface soil lead concentrations were 'routinely greater than 2,000 mg/kg'. At time of writing, the company that will design the remediation program had not yet been appointed.; 0
0485.00101; The remediation program is also intended to improve the drainage and flow of the Kabwe Canal, which was used to discharge mine waste when the mine was still operational. The canal annually becomes clogged with weeds and debris and then floods during the rainy season, The program also includes plans to upgrade the Kabwe solid waste dump site so it can serve as a repository for contaminated material from residential areas. Given the failure of previous projects to reduce soil lead levels in Kabwe's affected townships, the new project should adopt a more effective remediation approach.; 0
0485.00102; The new remediation design should be both comprehensive and sustainable enough to ensure a lasting solution.; 0
0485.00103; The former mine canal, pictured here, which discharged mine waste when the mine was still operational, annually becomes clogged with weeds and debris. It then floods during the rainy season, contaminating adjacent neighborhoods with lead.; 0
0485.00104; Juliane Kippenberg/Human Rights Watch. The Zambia Mining and Environmental Remediation and Improvement Project also includes plans for testing and treating at least 10,000 children, pregnant women, mothers, and other individuals, which will be overseen by the District Medical Officer in Kabwe. Children are meant to receive treatment in the form of chelation therapy or nutritional supplements, depending on their blood lead levels.; 0
0485.00105; As an improvement on the last project, children with blood lead levels of 45 ug/dL will be eligible for chelation therapy.; 0
0485.00106; Under the last project, only children with blood lead levels of 65 ug/dL and above received chelation. Without coordinated efforts to remediate, however, chelation will not be effective, a fact the World Bank notes in its Project Appraisal Document. Human Rights Watch was unable to ascertain the specific plans under the new project for the treatment of adults, including pregnant or breastfeeding women or other women of childbearing age.; 0
0485.00107; Breastmilk alternatives (i.e., infant formula) would be advisable for women with elevated blood lead levels, so long as the government ensures that breastmilk alternatives are targeted and do not disturb general community norms around breastfeeding.; 0
0485.00108; Infants born to women with elevated blood lead levels may also require specialised care. At time of writing, the testing and treatment regimen had not begun, and the Zambian government was still in the process of procuring chelation medicine through the United Nations Children's Fund.; 0
0485.00109; Officials from the Ministry of Mines and Minerals Development stated that the treatment campaign would commence with the first delivery of drugs in September 2019. Human Rights Watch was unable to confirm that the government will ensure that chelation is preceded by remediation in the case of each child treated, given the delays in both components of the project.; 0
0485.00110; The right to the highest attainable standard of health is guaranteed by international treaties to which Zambia is a party, including the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.; 0
0485.00111; The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the treaty body which interprets state obligations under the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights and monitors state compliance with its provisions, has held that social determinants of health are crucial to the full realisation of the right to health, including 'healthy occupational and environmental conditions, and access to health-related information and education'. According to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, a state party cannot, under any circumstances, justify its noncompliance with core obligations, which are non-derogable.; 0
0485.00112; The core obligations defined by the committee include providing essential drugs. Chelation medicine, included on both the World Health Organisation Model List of Essential Medicines and the World Health Organisation Model List of Essential Medicines for Children, should be seen as one such essential drug.; 0
0485.00113; The government should include it on its own list of essential medicines and take immediate steps to ensure its availability.; 0
0485.00114; The 2012 Persons with Disabilities Act of Zambia requires the government to ensure that persons with disabilities receive inclusive education, reasonable accommodation, 'the support required, within the general education system, to facilitate their effective education,' and 'effective individualised support measures … in environments that maximise academic and social development, consistent with the goal of full inclusion.'; 0
0485.00115; Reasonable accommodations can include allowing a student more time, reducing levels of background noise, or employing a qualified learning support assistant for one or more students.; 0
0485.00116; This applies to all children with disabilities - whether or not they are proven to be connected to lead. Lead poisoning can impair cognitive development, resulting in problems with concentration, memory, and learning. Parents, grandparents, teachers, and education officials told Human Rights Watch that children in Kabwe struggled with these very problems.; 0
0485.00117; Both an official at the Ministry of General Education and members of an education-focused NGO in the capital told Human Rights Watch that the national government is currently doing little to improve education for children with disabilities or learning barriers.; 0
0485.00118; Despite the prevalence of increased lead levels in Kabwe, education authorities said they were not routinely testing children with concentration and memory issues for lead levels. They assumed that lead exposure had caused learning barriers and disabilities but could not recall any cases in which they had requested lead tests.; 0
0485.00119; Some headteachers and teachers described their efforts to support children experiencing learning barriers. One headteacher said that his school sought to assist students experiencing learning barriers through additional support within the classroom and outside, individual attention, and involvement of parents.; 0
0485.00120; However, he also acknowledged that tuition was required for extra lessons. Human Rights Watch spoke to the parents and guardians of a number of children who had been tested and found to have elevated lead levels and who faced challenges in school because of poor memory, inability to focus, or slower pace when learning.; 0
0485.00121; Some said that their children did not receive accommodations in school to address these problems. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, to which Zambia is party, calls inclusive education 'a fundamental human right of all learners'. An inclusive education system should focus on 'the full and effective participation, accessibility, attendance and achievement of all students' in the ordinary school system.; 0
0485.00122; The education system should provide a personalised educational response and 'flexible curricula, teaching and learning methods, which requires support and reasonable accommodation so that learners are able to fulfil their potential'.; 0
0485.00123; Accommodations for pupils experiencing learning barriers or learning disabilities may include changing the location of a class, providing different forms of communication and learning materials in alternative/accessible formats, or providing students with a note taker.; 0
0485.00124; Provision of non-material accommodations, such as allowing a student more time, reducing levels of background noise, sensitivity to sensory overload, alternative evaluation methods or replacing an element of curriculum by an alternative element, should also be considered.; 0
0485.00125; Support can also consist of a qualified learning support assistant, either shared or on a one-to-one basis, depending on the requirements of the student.; 0
0485.00126; The Convention on the Rights of the Child guarantees 'the right of the child to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age of the child'.; 0
0485.00127; The Committee on the Rights of the Child has stated that children have a spontaneous urge to play and participate in recreational activities and will seek out opportunities to do so in the most unfavourable environments.; 0
0485.00128; However, certain conditions need to be assured, in accordance with children's evolving capacities, if they are to realise their rights to the optimum extent.; 0
0485.00129; One of these conditions, the Committee has found, is 'An environment sufficiently free from waste, pollution, traffic and other physical hazards to allow them to circulate freely and safely within their local neighbourhood'. Twenty-five years after the closure of the Kabwe mine, its waste dumps remain in place.; 0
0485.00130; No meaningful work has been undertaken to remove the source of the contamination.; 0
0485.00131; Lead dust from the uncovered waste dumps continues to blow over to nearby residential areas and threaten community health.; 0
0485.00132; The government has not conducted a remediation or reclamation (land restoration) program and has recently issued several licenses for small-scale mining.; 0
0485.00133; Small-scale mining at the former mine site produces risks to residents' health by creating another pathway for exposure to lead dust.; 0
0485.00134; The government has also granted a large-scale mining license for much of the former mine area to a company that plans to recover lead, zinc, and vanadium from the waste.; 0
0485.00135; Waste processing, if not carefully managed, carries the risk of creating further problems for human health and the environment by generating additional dust and polluting the water. The former mine area contains over three million tons of tailings (waste from the mining process), about 2.5 million tons of slag (waste from the smelter), and other waste.; 0
0485.00136; The most visible waste dump is a large, dark pile of slag, locally known as the .Black Mountain' because of its dark colour.; 0
0485.00137; While the lead content in different kinds of waste varies, every kind of lead waste poses risks to human health and the environment.; 0
0485.00138; After the 1994 closure of the mine, Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines issued a Kabwe Mine Site Rehabilitation and Decommissioning Plan in 1995 to address its environmental legacy.; 0
0485.00139; Over the next two years, Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines began to cover the tailings dumps (mine waste) with coarse, granular slag to reduce windblown lead dust. However, a World Bank-funded environmental assessment found in 2002 that those measures were 'incomplete because of financial constraints'. The government's strategy document for remediation does not include an assessment of remediation or reclamation options for the defunct Kabwe mine, such as capping (sealing) or removing the mine's waste piles, both practises employed elsewhere to remediate contaminated sites, for example in the United States, Canada, and Ghana.; 0
0485.00140; Since its closure in 1994, small-scale mining has become the main activity at the former Kabwe mine.; 0
0485.00141; Artisanal and small scale mining, that is, mining with little or no machinery, has been taking place in the absence of one central mining company. Small-scale mining for lead poses severe health risks and affects children in Kabwe twofold.; 0
0485.00142; First, children risk getting exposed to particularly high levels of lead when adult family members work at the mine and return home with lead on their body, clothes, tools, or shoes. Second, older children themselves work at the mine.; 0
0485.00143; Small-scale mining is an important economic sector in Zambia and many other countries across the globe, but small-scale mining for lead is rare.; 0
0485.00144; While the government has issued some licenses for mining, there are also unlicensed, illegal mining operations.; 0
0485.00145; View of a former mine pit, now flooded, at the old mine site in Kabwe. In the foreground is an area where small-scale miners still work today. Diane McCarthy/Human Rights Watch  When Human Rights Watch visited the mine area, adult men, adult women, and a few older boys were working at several spots, including the 'Black Mountain' and another area they called the 'Savage Mountain.'; 0
0485.00146; They dug up the soil and rocks, placed them in bags, and carried them to collection places or buyers. Some would wash the rocks to sift out certain minerals.; 0
0485.00147; Miners said they were mining for zinc and lead, as well as rock material called dolomite and the lead ore galena, and explained that other tasks including crushing rocks and selling the mined material to buyers.; 0
0485.00148; Most adults working at the mine were aware that lead is dangerous and tried to take steps to protect themselves, their children, and other relatives, such as washing and changing cloths before returning home. In their current form, these safety measures are unlikely to eliminate the risks to miners or their children. The miners are still exposed to lead dust while they work, and the lack of proper washing facilities near the mine site means they will not be able to remove all lead dust from their bodies, hair, clothes, shoes, and other items, such as bags.; 0
0485.00149; Some adult miners started working at the mine when they were under the age of 18 and still in school. After school hours, they worked at the mine to pay school fees.; 0
0485.00150; Human Rights Watch interviews confirmed that adult and child small-scale miners in Kabwe work in hazardous conditions. Although the Kabwe Municipal Council staff have gone to the mine site to teach the miners about safety, most miners are working without adequate precautions to protect themselves or their families from lead exposure.; 0
0485.00151; It is therefore a positive sign that the Zambian government has expressed an interest in ending unlicensed small-scale mining at the old mine site and that its latest World Bank-funded project includes plans to develop alternative income-generating activities for community members.; 0
0485.00152; The Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention prohibits the worst forms of child labour, including 'work which, by its nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out, is likely to harm the health, safety or morals of children' (also known as hazardous work).; 0
0485.00153; As a state party to the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, Zambia is obligated to take immediate and effective steps to ascertain what forms and conditions of child labour violate the convention and then prohibit and eliminate them. The Convention obliges member states to take immediate action to prevent children from engaging in the worst forms of child labour and to provide direct assistance for the removal of children engaged in the worst forms of child labour.; 0
0485.00154; Zambia is also a party to the Minimum Age Convention, which sets the basic minimum age for employment at 15, and states that children ages 13 to 15 may participate only in light work that is not likely to be harmful to their health or development or hinder their education.; 0
0485.00155; The Minimum Age Convention also prohibits children under 18 from engaging in hazardous work.; 0

0485.00158; If mining is to continue, however, the government should ensure that operations are licensed, regularly monitored, and only conducted in accordance with mining regulations and law.; 0
0485.00159; According to national law, small-scale mining licenses can only be granted when a project brief or environmental impact assessment has been approved by the Zambia Environmental Management Agency. In 2012, the government issued a large-scale mining license covering over seven square kilometres to a British company called Berkeley Mineral Resources.; 0
0485.00160; With the license, the company acquired the Kabwe tailings stockpiles as well as all other mined resources or unmined resources at the former mine, meaning they gained access both to waste produced during previous mining and to raw materials that had not yet been mined.; 0
0485.00161; At the same time, Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Investment Holdings retained historical liabilities, shielding Berkeley Mineral Resources from legal liability for existing environmental damage. In addition, Berkeley Mineral Resources' subsidiary Enviro Processing Limited obtained a small-scale mining license in 2011.; 0
0485.00162; The government has opened the door for further mining and mineral waste processing, but it has not addressed the legacy of contamination. Enviro Processing Limited submitted an environmental impact statement to the Zambia Environmental Management Agency.; 0
0485.00163; The company has stated that it was planning to clean up the former Kabwe mine by removing lead and zinc from the tailings through chemical processing/ Waste processing carries the risk of creating further problems for human health and the environment by generating additional dust and polluting the water.; 0
0485.00164; Human Rights Watch interviewed two independent experts on mine tailings for an assessment of Enviro Processing Limited's environmental impact statement: Ann Maest, a geochemist and Chief Scientist with E-Tech International, a non-profit that provides environmental technical support to communities on potential environmental impacts of large development projects, and Stuart Levit is a land reclamation specialist working with the US based Center for Science in Public Participation. Both experts concluded that EPL's proposal failed to demonstrate how any harmful impacts of the proposed reprocessing activities would be prevented or mitigated.; 0
0485.00165; In particular, they concluded that the environmental impact assessment lacked vital information and baseline data on the composition of the tailings, the existing water and air quality, and other factors, resulting in an inconclusive and poor assessment of environmental and health risks.; 0
0485.00166; In 2018, Jubilee Metals Group, a South African company, entered into a joint venture with Berkeley Mineral Resources.; 0
0485.00167; As designated sole operator of the project, Jubilee Metals reviewed and changed Berkeley Mineral Resources's plans by, among other things, opting to separate the zinc and lead recovery processes and proposing a method to recover the highly valuable metal vanadium as well.; 0
0485.00168; In March 2019, Jubilee Metals announced that it had bought a refinery right next to the former Kabwe mine for zinc processing, and that it anticipated producing metal within one year.; 0
0485.00169; Human Rights Watch spoke with Berkeley Mineral Resources and Jubilee Metals and wrote both companies, requesting further information on how they planned to address the environmental and health risks of these operations. Berkeley Mineral Resources responded by referring Human Rights Watch to Jubilee. Jubilee did not respond.; 0
0485.00170; Representatives of the Zambia Environmental Management Agency told Human Rights Watch they had recently met with Jubilee Metals to discuss its proposed Kabwe project and instructed Jubilee to submit a new environmental impact assessment before commencing operations.; 0
0485.00171; Governments have a duty to protect human rights in the context of business activity, through effective regulation.; 0
0485.00172; The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which the UN Human Rights Council endorsed in 2011, state that this 'requires taking appropriate steps to prevent, investigate and redress such abuse through effective policies, legislation, regulations and adjudication'.; 0
0485.00173; Governments also have a duty to effectively enforce that legal and regulatory framework once it is in place, to prevent abuse and ensure accountability and redress for abuses that do occur. Governments should also continually assess whether existing rules, and the enforcement of those rules, are actually adequate to the task of ensuring respect for human rights, and improve upon them if they are not..; 0
0485.00174; While governments have the primary responsibility to respect, protect, and fulfil human rights under international law, private entities, including businesses, also have internationally recognised responsibilities regarding human rights, including workers' rights and children's rights. The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights are widely accepted as a legitimate articulation of businesses' human rights responsibilities.; 0
0485.00175; They specify that businesses should exercise human rights due diligence to identify human rights risks associated with their operations, take effective steps to prevent or mitigate those risks, and ensure that the victims of any abuses have access to remedies.; 0
0485.00176; The Convention on the Rights of the Child has maintained that 'duties and responsibilities to respect the rights of children extend in practise beyond the State and … apply to private actors and business enterprises,' and that 'all businesses must meet their responsibilities regarding children's rights and States must ensure they do so.'; 0
0485.00177; The committee has also noted that 'voluntary actions of corporate responsibility by business enterprises, such as social investments, advocacy and public policy engagement, voluntary codes of conduct, philanthropy, and other collective actions, can advance children's rights,' but that these actions 'are not a substitute for State action and regulation of businesses … or for businesses to comply with their responsibilities to respect children's rights.'; 0
0485.00178; Furthermore, the Convention on the Rights of the Child has stated, 'if children are identified as victims of environmental pollution, immediate steps should be taken by all relevant parties to prevent further damage to the health and development of children and repair any damage done'. For these reasons Human Rights Watch makes the following recommendations:   That the Government of Zambia should acknowledge full responsibility for remedying the ongoing harms caused by the now-defunct Kabwe mine, and develop a program for sustainable, comprehensive lead remediation, testing, and treatment in Kabwe, which should establish a fund to support ongoing nutrition and health care needs for long-term lead-affected residents of Kabwe. That the Zambian Ministry of Mines and Mineral Development conduct a thorough environmental assessment of current lead levels in Kabwe soil, dust, air, crops, and water, as well as other possible exposure pathways, to identify priority areas for remediation under the current World Bank-funded project, and publish this data, and ensure that the remediation of contaminated hotspots under the current World Bank-funded project and any other efforts are both comprehensive and sustainable.; 0
0485.00179; The ministry should also ensure that small-scale mining activities at and around the former Kabwe mine are closely monitored and that laws and regulations on mining and the environment are enforced, inform miners about precautions they should take to protect themselves and their families from lead, and develop alternative economic opportunities for artisanal and small-scale miners.; 0
0485.00180; Furthermore it should work with the Ministry of Labour and Social Security to assist children to transition out of small-scale mining operations in Kabwe and into schools and vocational training. Ensure that there is ongoing monitoring of child labour in small scale mines.; 0
0485.00181; The ministry should also develop and implement a comprehensive and sustainable solution for the remediation and reclamation of the former Kabwe mine, such as the capping or removal of waste piles, and publish all environmental liability agreements developed at the time of mine privatisation. Human Rights Watch also recommends that Kabwe District Council should publish existing data on lead levels in soil, air, and elsewhere in the environment in Kabwe, work with the Ministry of Mines and Minerals Development to ensure that the remediation of contaminated hotspots under the current World Bank-funded project and any other efforts are comprehensive and sustainable, and ensure regular, broad, and meaningful public consultation and participation in the development, implementation, and monitoring of remediation efforts. Include dedicated measures that facilitate the participation of groups that may face specific impacts or that are marginalised, such as women, youth, children, the elderly, and people with disabilities.; 0

0485.00183; Human Rights Watch recommends that the Kabwe District Health Office ensure that all children and adults in Kabwe are given access to free testing and, as appropriate, free treatment for lead poisoning., and undertake regular monitoring of blood lead levels, iron deficiency, neurodevelopment, nutrition, and other relevant indicators.; 0
0485.00184; Ensure that all treatment, especially chelation therapy, coincides with remediation without remediation, patients will be re-exposed to lead when they return home. The District Health Office should also provide support for women with elevated blood lead levels during pregnancy and after delivery, including breastmilk alternatives (i.e., infant formula) for women with elevated blood lead levels, ensure that breastmilk alternatives are targeted and do not disturb general community norms around breastfeeding, provide specialised care for infants born to women with elevated blood lead levels, and Train more community health workers. The Zambian Ministry of Health should ensure health workers at all levels of the public health system are trained on lead poisoning detection and prevention, testing, post-test counselling, treatment, and patient confidentiality, track lead poisoning in the national Health Management Information System or develop a separate database for Kabwe to track cases of lead poisoning, including lead-related hospitalisation and mortality, and update the Zambia Essential Medicine List to include chelation medicine.; 0
0485.00185; The Zambia Environmental Management Agency should conduct an environmental impact assessment of small-scale mining on the site of the defunct Kabwe mine, and ensure that small-scale mining only takes place if it complies with all laws and regulations that protect human health and the environment, and also conduct a new environmental impact assessment of plans by Jubilee Metals Group to recover lead, zinc, and vanadium from tailings and slag in Kabwe, and ensure that any future business undertakings, including re-mining, respect human rights and neither contribute to further lead contamination nor undermine efforts at remediation.; 0
0485.00186; The Ministry of General Education and Kabwe District Education Board should ensure inclusive education and reasonable accommodations for children with disabilities and learning barriers, integrate environmental education on lead into the school curriculum in Kabwe, and ensure teachers receive additional training to understand how lead can affect learning, instruct the District Assessment Centre to request lead tests for children with disabilities, ensure schools have sufficient numbers of adequately trained teachers to provide learning support while addressing large class-room sizes.; 0
0485.00187; The World Bank should promote regular community engagement and information-sharing under the Zambia Mining and Environmental Remediation and Improvement Project and encourage the Zambian government to ensure that key goals for testing, treatment, and remediation are met under the project in a timely manner.; 0
0485.00188; Furthermore Human Rights Watch recommends that donor countries and UN agencies support the efforts of the Government of Zambia and civil society actors to address lead poisoning in Kabwe and that UN special procedures bodies and treaty bodies monitor the impact of lead in Kabwe on children's rights, the right to health, the right to a healthy environment, and the right to a quality, inclusive education, monitor the progress of health and remediation efforts in Kabwe, and monitor the Zambian government's implementation of its international obligations in relation to lead contamination and children's rights, such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.; 0
0485.00189; Urge the government to ensure that it complies with these obligations.; 0
0485.00190; Finally Human Rights Watch recommends that the African Commission on Human and People's Rights address the impact of lead contamination on children's rights in Kabwe in future research undertakings, missions, or statements on Zambia. See also...; 0

0491.00004; What happened was an unfortunate coincidence  -  just as companies were withdrawing cash from money markets to pay corporate tax, a glut of new bonds appeared on the market as the U.S. government sold some $78 billion of 10- and 30-year debt last week. With just $24 billion of bonds maturing in the period, this became one of three occasions this year when the imbalance between debt redemption and cash needed to buy new Treasuries exceeded $50 billion.; 1
0491.00005; Suddenly there was a scarcity of dollars at the same time as a glut of Treasuries, which banks typically lend out to investors with spare cash through repurchase agreement. As a result, the overnight repo rate more than doubled to 4.75%, the highest level since December, according to ICAP pricing.; 1

0491.00010; Short-dated eurodollar futures dropped, and implied rates rose, as short-term funding rates climbed. The repo market remains vulnerable to short-term liquidity squeezes anyway due to structural issues, which often surface around year-end.; 0
0491.00011; The culprit is the scarcity of bank reserves, which are the only asset that provides banks with intraday liquidity, Priya Misra, head of global rates strategy at TD Securities in New York, wrote in a note. Reserves have been declining since 2014 and we expect them to decline further as Treasury's cash balance increases and currency in circulation grows. Bloomberg News; 0

0492.00003; Why it matters: The Fed's 2nd consecutive rate cut reflects worries about the U.S. economy.; 0
0492.00004; The trade war and slowing growth around the world have made corporate executives more worried than they've been in years. The move prompted a near-immediate from President Trump, who called chair Powell a terrible communicator. The president has demanded in a series of tweets that the Fed cut interest rates more aggressively.; 0
0492.00005; The big picture: Speaking at a press conference, Powell again cited the trade war as a key risk to the economic outlook. Our business contacts around the country have been telling us that uncertainty about trade policy has discouraged them from investing in their businesses, Powell said. Still, showed a division among Fed officials about whether more rate cuts are warranted this year.; 0
0492.00006; Powell did note that if the economy does turn down, then a more extensive sequence of rate cuts could be appropriate.; 0
0492.00007; Powell also acknowledged the liquidity shortfall in money markets that has forced the Fed to intervene  -  something that before this week hadn't happened since the financial crisis.; 0
0492.00008; In response to the drama in the short-term funding markets, Powell suggested that the Fed may increase the size of its balance sheet through organic growth earlier than expected. Federal Reserve System  Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn  Courtenay Brown; 0

0495.00002; If you live in the London area we, at Fisher Phillips LLP, can provide  taxation advice to ensure that maximum opportunity is taken of the reliefs  available for capital gains tax.; 0
0495.00003; A capital gain arises when certain capital (or 'chargeable') assets are sold at a profit. The gain is the sale proceeds (net of selling costs) less the purchase price (including acquisition costs).; 0
0495.00004; What are the main features of the current system?; 0
0495.00005; Capital gains tax (CGT) is charged at the rate of 10% on gains (including any held over gains coming into charge) where net total taxable gains and income is below the income tax basic rate band threshold.; 1
0495.00006; Gains or any parts of gains above the basic rate band are charged at 20% with a few exceptions which are considered in the 'Exceptions to the CGT rates section' below.; 0
0495.00007; Entrepreneurs' Relief (ER) or Investors' Relief (IR) may be available on certain business disposals.; 0
0495.00008; Entrepreneurs' Relief (ER) ER may be available for certain business disposals and has the effect of charging the first £10 million of gains qualifying for the relief at an effective rate of 10%.; 1
0495.00009; The relief will be available to individuals on the disposal of: the whole, or part, of a trading business that is carried on by the individual, either alone or in partnership shares in an individual's 'personal company' assets used by a business or a company which has ceased within the last three years Where an individual makes a qualifying business disposal, relief may also be available on an 'associated disposal'.; 0
0495.00010; An 'associated disposal' is a disposal of an asset: used in a qualifying company or group of companies of the individual or used in a partnership, where the individual is a partner. Restrictions on obtaining the relief on an 'associated disposal' are likely to apply in certain specific situations.; 0
0495.00011; This includes the common situation where a property is in personal ownership but is used in an unquoted company or partnership trade in return for a rent.; 0
0495.00012; Under ER the availability of relief is restricted where rent is paid.; 0
0495.00013; Ownership period of two years Ownership conditions apply throughout the period up to the date of disposal.; 0
0495.00014; For disposals on or after 6 April 2019, the necessary qualifying period of ownership is two years.; 0
0495.00015; The 5% rule for company shareholders To qualify for ER, the company needs to be an individual's 'personal company' where the individual must: be a company employee or office holder hold at least 5% of the company's ordinary share capital and be able to exercise at least 5% of the voting rights.; 1
0495.00016; For disposals on or after 29 October 2018, they must also satisfy one of the following tests: a distribution test  -  an individual is entitled to at least 5% of the company's profit available for distribution to equity holders and 5% of the assets available for distribution to equity holders in a winding up or a proceeds test  -  an individual is entitled to at least 5% of the proceeds in the event of a disposal of the whole of the ordinary share capital of the company.; 1
0495.00017; Dilution From 6 April 2019 those shareholders whose holding in their company is reduced below the normal 5% qualifying level as a result of raising funds for commercial purposes by means of an issue of new shares may still obtain ER.; 1
0495.00018; An election can be made which allows shareholders to crystallise a gain on their shares before the dilution occurs.; 0
0495.00019; This would be achieved by treating the shareholding as having been sold and immediately re-purchased at the prevailing market value. The election will have to be made in their tax return for the year in which the dilution takes place.; 0
0495.00020; The shareholder may also elect to defer the accrued gain until their shares are actually disposed of. Careful planning will be required with ER but if you would like to discuss ER in detail and how it might affect your business, please do get in touch. Investors' Relief (IR) ER has been extended to external investors (other than certain employees or officers of the company) in unlisted trading companies.; 0
0495.00021; To qualify for the 10% CGT rate under 'investors' relief' the following conditions need to be met: shares must be newly issued and subscribed for by the individual for new consideration be in an unlisted trading company, or an unlisted holding company of a trading group have been issued by the company on or after 17 March 2016 and have been held for a period of three years from 6 April 2016 have been held continuously for a period of three years before disposal. An individual's qualifying gains for IR are subject to a lifetime cap of £10 million. Share identification rules All shares of the same class in the same company are treated as forming a single asset, regardless of when they were originally acquired.; 0
0495.00022; However, 'same day' transactions are matched and the '30 day' anti-avoidance rules will remain.; 0
0495.00023; Example On 15 April 2019 Jeff sold 2000 shares in A plc from his holding of 4000 shares which he had acquired as follows: 1000 in January 1990 1500 in March 2001 1500 in July 2005 Due to significant stock market changes, he decided to purchase 500 shares on 30 April 2019 in the same company.; 1
0495.00024; The disposal of 2000 shares will be matched firstly with the later transaction of 500 shares as it is within the following 30 days and then with 1,500/ 4000 (1000+1500+1500) of the single asset pool on an average cost basis. CGT annual exemption Every tax year each individual is allowed to make gains up to the annual exemption without paying any CGT. The annual exemption for 2019/20 is £12,000 (£11,700 in 2018/19).; 0
0495.00025; Consideration should be given to ensuring both spouses/civil partners utilise this facility. Exceptions to the CGT rates The rates of CGT are generally 10% and 20%.; 0
0495.00026; However 18% and 28% rates apply for carried interest and for chargeable gains on residential property that does not qualify for private residence relief.; 1
0495.00027; Other more complex areas Capital gains can arise in many other situations. Some of these, such as gains on Enterprise Investment Scheme and Venture Capital Trust shares, and deferred gains on share for share or share for loan note exchanges, can be complex.; 0
0495.00028; Please talk to us before making any decisions.; 0
0495.00029; Other reliefs which you may be entitled to And finally, many existing reliefs continue to be available, such as: private residence relief business asset rollover relief, which enables the gain on a business asset to be deferred until a point in the future business asset gift relief, which allows the gain on business assets that are given away to be held over until the assets are disposed of by the donee and any unused allowable losses from previous years, which can be brought forward in order to reduce any gains.; 0
0495.00030; How we can help Careful planning of capital asset disposals is essential in order to minimise capital gains tax. If you live in the London area we, at Fisher Phillips LLP, would be happy to discuss the options with you.; 0

0496.00001; If your company has recently received a Winding-Up Petition, then it is crucial you take immediate action and seek advice!; 0
0496.00002; A Winding-Up Petition is a serious matter and a course of action taken by a creditor against unpaid debt(s). You may have already been served with a statutory demand for payment of the outstanding debt(s) and the Winding-Up Petition is the final course of action is the statutory demand has been ignored. Usually, the next stage to your Winding-Up Petition is for it to be advertised in the London Gazette.; 0
0496.00003; This can alert your bank who will freeze your company bank account stopping payments being made. The effect of this on your business will be devastating.; 0
0496.00004; It is crucial you contact us immediately the petition has been received as there are more options available to your business and once we are familiar with your situation we can look to put solutions in place to protect your business.; 0
0496.00005; Not only do we sometimes have the ability to adjourn the petition there are also a number of rescue procedures available to your company which may help to avoid the winding-up of your company and in some instances preserve the business.     A creditor can present a petition against your company if they are owed more than £750 and can prove that you are unable to pay them.; 0
0496.00006; The first stage is usually for a statutory demand to be issued against your company which is a formal demand for payment of the debt within 21 days. If the debt is not paid within this timescale or a satisfactory agreed repayment plan is not accepted then it is typical of the creditor to present a winding-up petition in the High Court to enable a winding-up order to be sanctioned against your company.; 0
0496.00007; Please be aware that if the creditor already has a successful County Court Judgement (CCJ) against your company then they do not have a requirement to serve a statutory demand and can proceed straight to a Winding-Up Petition.     As mentioned above, a winding-up petition is a very serious matter and requires immediate action from the directors of the company.; 0
0496.00008; The main options available to you are as follows: 1. Speak to the Creditor You'll see if you can arrange an informal repayment of the debt if the petition is dismissed, which may be very unlikely in the circumstances. Usually to get to this position the creditor will have incurred additional costs in bringing about the action so may be reluctant to agree any kind of informal payment.; 0
0496.00009; 2.; 0
0496.00010; Propose a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) A CVA is a formal legally binding agreement to repay the company debts over a period of time. Please refer to our section on CVA's where these are explained in more detail. 3.; 0
0496.00011; Notice of Intention There are options in certain circumstances to apply to file a Notice of Intention (NOI) with the court to allow a stay of proceedings while the company looks to explore the viability of the Administration procedure.; 0
0496.00012; Whilst this NOI is in place, the court halts any action being taken against the company and if the Administration is successfully entered into then all legal actions against the company will cease.; 0
0496.00013; 4. Sell your assets Unfortunately if you have to face liquidation there may be possibilities of the current directors or other third parties purchasing some or all of the assets of the business.; 0
0496.00014; 5. Dismissals and Adjournements We are able to instruct specialist solicitors to assist with the dismissal or adjournment of the petition in instances where it is genuinely disputed if it can be argued legitimately that the company needs more time to pay or that the outstanding debt amount is not accurate.; 0
0496.00015; In these circumstances, it may be possible to stop or postpone the petition from being advertised. 6. Payment in full Finally and the most obvious solution is to make full payment of the debt.; 0
0496.00016; It may be possible to raise finance against company assets in order to release funds to discharge the debt.; 0
0496.00017; Head in the right direction. Talk to Fortis.; 0
0496.00018; The costs incurred by the petitioning creditor will usually range up to around £750 in addition to the courts deposit of roughly £1,200. These expenses have to be covered prior to anything else.; 0
0496.00019; Further to these initial costs there will solicitors costs to cover as they will need to instruct a barrister to attend the hearing on your behalf. Fortis have assisted numerous companies in these instances with successful outcomes which has allowed business to avoid the consequences of failure. The total outlay for the above will be in the region of £2,000 but a small price to pay if it means the preservation of your business.; 1
0496.00020; The final matter to be aware of once the winding up order is granted is that the appointed liquidator will have a duty to investigate the conduct of the Directors.; 0
0496.00021; This will focus on making sure there was no fraudulent or wrongful trading especially during the period the company was deemed to be insolvent. Directors that are found to be guilty of misconduct can be made personally liable for the amassed debts of the company during the period of insolvency. Any further implications like fraudulent trading can be punishable by way of a fine, imprisonment and Director disqualification which restricts you from acting as a Director of a Limited company for a period of up to 15 years.; 0
0496.00022; Should you wish to discuss any aspects of Winding-Up Petitions or the liquidation process then please do not hesitate to contact us. All initial conversations and meetings are confidential and free of charge.; 0

0497.00009; SoftBank's critics question how sustainable it is to flood fast-growing companies with hundreds of millions of dollars. That criticism looks pertinent as its portfolio firm WeWork lurches towards an IPO with a lower-than-expected valuation and as SoftBank's Uber stake goes underwater.; 0

Founded in Tokyo in 1981 by Masayoshi Son, its CEO and chairman, SoftBank began life as a store selling packaged computer software.; 0
0497.00015; Despite having no software to sell, Son sealed contracts with both electronics retailer Joshin and Japanese software developer Hudson. By 1984, he controlled around half of the Japanese retail market for computer software.; 0

As the brainchild of Masayoshi Son, the Fund is aimed at realising Son's grand vision for humanity and the idea that AI will play an increasingly fundamental role in people's lives across the next 300 years. The Fund's cash comes from multiple sources, with the Saudi Public Investment Fund the biggest contributor, having committed $45 billion to the project.; 0
0497.00022; The UAE's Mubadala Investment Company - which is also state-owned - has committed $15 billion, with SoftBank itself contributing $25 billion.; 0

On the flipside, the biggest backers of its original Fund, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and the UAE's Mubadala Investment Company, do not appear as committed to Fund 2.; 0
0497.00029; According to Bloomberg, both are reconsidering their involvement in Fund 2 in the wake of WeWork's shelved IPO last week.

0497.00085; SoftBank had apparently expected C2FO to pitch for SoftBank's investment - and were puzzled when Kemper did not pull out a pitch deck. The idea was very much, initially, let's find a way to create more net profit and gross margin for the portfolio of companies of SoftBank's, so that the valuation of those companies goes up, Kemper said. But when SoftBank realised Kemper was not going to pitch them, they took immediate action...; 0

0497.00106; But one founder who preferred to stay anonymous told Business Insider that they turned down SoftBank's cash when it was on the table.

0499.00002; By  Writer  In the not-quite-a-week that General Motors workers have been striking, seeking better wages for less-tenured workers and trying to hang on to their unusually sweet deal on health insurance, there has been the usual choosing of sides.; 0
0499.00003; On Twitter, Rep.; 0
0499.00004; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has slammed GM GM, -0.01% as during a time of what she called record profits, specifically after the auto maker said it would suspend payments for strikers' health insurance.; 1
0499.00005; In the New York Post, conservative economist Steve Malanga sided with the company, that have little apparent connection to today's GM.; 0
0499.00006; They're both wrong.; 0
0499.00007; But the ambiguity of what's actually true highlights how challenging it's going to be to break 40-plus years of wage stagnation, now that at least the Democratic Party at least, prodded by Ocasio-Cortez and her fellow occupants of the party's leftward flank, is trying to figure out how to do it. As I often do, I'll urge you readers to begin by understanding a few numbers.; 0
0499.00008; And GM's numbers aren't great.; 0
0499.00009; Ocasio-Cortez to the contrary, GM is experiencing nothing like record profits. On one level, its $6.7 billion operating income last year is nothing to sneeze at.; 0
0499.00010; But it's actually down about 36% from $10.6 billion in 2016  -  and the company lost $3.9 billion in net income in 2017, when it had an unusually big tax bill.; 1
0499.00011; And the net income line is far from the most challenging part of GM's financial profile. The worst part is the cash flow statement, which shows that GM has had more than $20 billion of negative free cash flow in the last two years.; 0
0499.00012; And there is a simple reason for that: The company has spent $25 billion to $27 billion a year since 2015 on capital expenditures  -  which aren't immediately deducted from earnings.; 1
0499.00013; Why? Simple.; 0
0499.00014; To save the company  -  and, oh yes, the planet.; 0
0499.00015; The lion's share of that money is going into the company's drive to bring to market by 2023, and to develop self-driving vehicles that may ultimately power GM's transformation into a company that sells transportation services to people who buy fewer cars, or none at all  -  a kind of uber-Uber. With schoolchildren gathering in New York and other cities to protest climate change on Friday, it's worth remembering that a transition to electric vehicles represents the single biggest change society has to make to keep rising sea levels from flooding coastal cities all over the world, along with myriad other effects.; 0
0499.00016; It's also a huge competitive challenge for GM  -  one on the cover of this week's issue of Bloomberg Businessweek.; 0
0499.00017; If Tesla TSLA, -2.14% takes control of that market  -  as it might have done already with better leadership  -  or if GM falls into an also-ran position in a market where are supposed to reach the market by 2022, that's a fatal threat to GM. On top of that, the is .; 0
0499.00018; True, of that event is somewhere between waiting (endlessly) for Godot and Meg Ryan's tearful bewailing of her looming 40th birthday in When Harry Met Sally, the joke of which was that the meltdown came when she was 32.; 0
0499.00019; But for narrow-margin, capital-intensive car companies, recessions are no joke.; 0
0499.00020; So it isn't surprising, or greedy, that GM is resisting adding more costs now.; 0
0499.00021; And yes  -  note to the board  -  that same discipline needs to apply to executive pay.; 0
0499.00022; CEO Mary Barra made $21.9 million last year, more than half of which was stock and options. But if you're sympathetic to GM's workers, know that Barra's pay, while high, isn't a runaway train  -  it was little changed in 2018. Also, the company recently cut thousands of white-collar workers.; 0
0499.00023; On the other hand, the production workers have a point: They did sacrifice when the company was on the ropes in 2009 and do deserve to claw some of those concessions back now that the company's condition has normalized. Back then, the United Auto Workers agreed to let the company pay new assembly-line hires about half of the previous rate ($15 versus $29 per hour), which previous hires kept earning.; 1
0499.00024; Those workers would see their pay rise to the level of more-tenured workers after eight years with the company.; 0
0499.00025; The union wants the introductory wage boosted now, and for the catch-up period for those who stick with the job to be reduced to four years.; 0
0499.00026; And it resists management's efforts to shift more health-insurance premiums onto workers  -  a goal workers throughout America might sympathize with, since thousands of nonunionized companies have been passing health-insurance inflation onto their staff for years. The parties will end up working these issues out  -  and they should, because each side has a point.; 0
0499.00027; I'd bet that the UAW gets less than it wants, but gets something on the two-wage-scale issue and mostly, if not entirely, prevails on health insurance.; 0
0499.00028; The lesson to the rest of us is to let the process work, with a minimum of name-calling on either side.; 0
0499.00029; Democrats, as a party, want to help unions become more powerful again, hoping that collective bargaining will help undo the concentrations of wealth that technology, globalization and tax policy have wrought.; 0
0499.00030; Republicans came to power in 2016 on a wave of race-baiting and demonization of brown people that has plagued their party in both election years since, and promises to do the same next year and beyond.; 0
0499.00031; Democrats would do well not to let the same type of oversimplification and vilification  -  just with different villains  -  become the central selling point of their politics.

0502.00001; RBS becomes the first Big Four UK bank to be led by a woman, with Alison Rose to take over the reins from departing CEO Ross McEwan the day after Brexit  New RBS chief executive Alison Rose (Credit: RBS)  Alison Rose has been appointed as the new chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS)  -  becoming the first female boss of a Big Four bank in the UK. The current deputy CEO of NatWest Holdings  -  a division of RBS  -  will take on the role from 1 November.; 0
0502.00002; Incumbent RBS boss Ross McEwan announced in April his intention to step down from his role at the head of the 62% state-owned banking giant, saying it was the right time to go having delivered on his strategy of stabilising the bank following its post-crisis bailout.; 1
0502.00003; He will retire on 31 October  -  the same day Britain is set to leave the European Union.; 0
0502.00004; RBS chairman Howard Davies said he was delighted to appoint Rose, who also heads up its commercial and private banking division in her existing position. She brings extensive experience and a track record of success from her previous roles at the bank, he added.; 0
0502.00005; Following a rigorous internal and external process, I am confident that we have appointed the best person for the job. Who is Alison Rose?; 0
0502.00006; An RBS 'lifer' now taking on the top job A history graduate from Durham University, Rose joined RBS in 1994 and has been there ever since  -  forging a path up the corporate steps over the course of a 25-year career.; 0
0502.00007; She has held senior roles in the leveraged finance, international banking and commercial banking divisions of the business, and was made deputy CEO of NatWest Holdings in December 2018. Rose has been a strong advocate of gender diversity in the workplace, and recently led the Rose Review  -  a Treasury-commissioned report on female entrepreneurship in the UK, and the barriers faced by women seeking to develop a business.; 0
0502.00008; In it, she said: I firmly believe that the disparity that exists between female and male entrepreneurs is unacceptable and holding the UK back. The unrealised potential for the UK economy is enormous.; 0
0502.00009; The Royal Bank of Scotland is about to reveal its new boss to guide it through difficult times to come (Credit: Mark Ramsay/Flickr)  To make the UK the most attractive place to do business we need the creativity and innovation that comes from diversity of thought in order to keep up with the rapidly changing world around us.; 0
0502.00010; Within RBS, Rose oversees an accelerator programme for entrepreneurs  -  with 50% of the participants being female  -  as well as the bank's Women in Business programme, which runs a support network helping female business leaders achieve success. Her work hasn't gone unnoticed, she was shortlisted for the 'most influential woman in investment banking' award by Financial News and included in the 2018 Women in Fintech Powerlist.; 0
0502.00011; What will Alison Rose encounter at the head of RBS? RBS remains 62.4% publicly-owned, following a £46bn government bailout agreement at the height of the 2008 financial crisis.; 1
0502.00012; Last year, the Office for Budget Responsibility confirmed Treasury plans to offload its shares in the bank over a five year period  -  yielding an estimated £20.6bn ($24.9bn) by 2024.; 1
0502.00013; It is likely that the re-privatisation of the Royal Bank of Scotland will fall under Rose's stewardship, bringing to an end more than a decade of public ownership. The challenge of navigating Brexit and global economic uncertainty caused by global trade tensions will dominate the near-term outlooks of all firms working across financial services.; 0
0502.00014; RBS' latest financial results revealed a 46% year-on-year increase to operating profits in the first six months of the year to £2.69bn ($3.25bn)  -  attributable profits grew to £2.04bn ($2.46bn) in the same period. A £1.7bn ($2.1bn) dividend to shareholders was also announced, around £1bn ($1.2bn) of which will be paid to Treasury coffers.; 1
0502.00015; Brexit uncertainty is clouding economic prospects across the industry  RBS issued a warning, however, that it was very unlikely to hit next year's profit targets, given the uncertainty and upheaval caused by Brexit and other global economic challenges. Outgoing CEO McEwan, who is now poised to become CEO of National Australia Bank, said: This is a solid set of results in challenging market conditions.; 0
0502.00016; We have delivered our largest half year profit in more than a decade and have announced a further £1.7bn ($2.1bn) in dividends to shareholders, of which more than £1bn ($1.2bn) will go directly to the UK taxpayer.; 1
0502.00017; Given the uncertain and competitive environment, we are focused on the areas we can control  -  costs are down, capital and liquidity are strong and we continue to grow lending to the real economy. Alison Rose is appointed RBS CEO  -  how much is her salary?; 0
0502.00018; After her long-mooted appointment was confirmed on 20 September, it was revealed Rose said: It is a huge honour to have been appointed as the new CEO of RBS and I am looking forward to getting started. As one of the oldest and most important financial institutions in the UK, we have a key role to play in supporting the economy and championing the potential that exists across the country. Our industry is facing a series of challenges  -  from the ongoing economic and political uncertainty to shifts in the behaviour and expectations of our customers, driven by rapid advances in technology.; 0
0502.00019; It will be my priority to make sure we are ready to meet these challenges and build the best bank for families, businesses and communities.; 0
0502.00020; We will be driven with real purpose in our work to help achieve the goals and potential of our customers and be there for them at key moments in their lives.; 0
0502.00021; Rose will be paid £1.1m per year alongside a share-based bonus worth up to 175% of her salary  She will get a share allowance of up to 100% of her salary and annual benefits of £26,250. RBS said it was a restrained pay position in terms of comparable roles.; 0

0503.00007; Using the previously constructed, 21 CFR Part 11 Compliant database the Core will use and improve upon existing and develop new automated tools for real time data entry and checking, reporting back to the Cores and Clinical Centers with data issues, and help educate on how to assure higher quality for future data entries. The Core will continue to work with and develop new tools for electronic data capture when feasible.; 0
0503.00008; In this way the Core will work closely with the other Cores and Clinical Centers to assure efficient and accurate data entry and capture. The Core will assist with patient tracking and recruitment and retention of study participants assist with exchange of participant samples and data within the ALLFDTD consortium and with other research groups including the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (NCRAD), the Laboratory of Neuroimaging (LONI) and the FTD Disorders Registry (FTDDR).; 0

0505.00001; Boards must strike a balance to ensure shareholders receive value while the interests of other stakeholders are safeguarded, says prominent academic. The debate about the purpose of organisations has heightened in Australia and overseas this year.; 0
0505.00002; At its core, it is about whether corporations exist to maximise profits and serve shareholders, or have broader stakeholder responsibilities, or both. The Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister, Ben Morton, this month criticised business for pandering to activist groups and noisy elites who push social agendas.; 0
0505.00003; He called for business to focus on providing the best product or service, and maximising profit, within the law.; 0
0505.00004; Business Council of Australia CEO, Jennifer Westacott, reportedly said days later that business should make a virtue of being profitable companies, seemingly supporting the Federal Government's view that business should avoid supporting fashionable social causes.; 0
0505.00005; In the United States, the Business Roundtable, an organisation for CEOs of large companies, made headlines in August with its revised Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation.; 0
0505.00006; Signed by 181 CEOs, the Statement calls for companies to serve all stakeholders. Critics of the Statement see it as a major shift from shareholder primacy to a greater focus on stakeholder capitalism, where organisations serve a range of stakeholders (including shareholders) and boards govern for them. The Council of Institutional Investors in the US, a corporate governance advocate, criticised the Business Roundtable Statement: CII believes boards and managers need to sustain a focus on long-term shareholder value.; 0
0505.00007; To achieve long-term shareholder value, it is critical to respect stakeholders, but also to have clear accountability to company owners. Accountability to everyone means accountability to no one.; 0
0505.00008; In a statement, CII added: Much of the discussion on 'stakeholder' governance focuses on individual companies, and seems to downplay or ignore the role of markets.; 0
0505.00009; Shareholders have a very particular role in allocating (and re-allocating) equity capital.; 0
0505.00010; The Governance Leadership Centre asked Professor Pamela Hanrahan, Professor of Commercial Law and Regulation, and Deputy Head of School (Research) at UNSW Business School, for her view on the debate between shareholder and stakeholder capitalism (and governance).; 0
0505.00011; Hanrahan is one of Australia's leading authorities on financial-services law and regulation. GLC: Pamela, how do you define stakeholder capitalism and why is it in vogue again? Pamela Hanrahan: It's a term that has been around since the late 1990s.; 0
0505.00012; It is often associated with R. Edward Freeman. He would define it as a system in which corporations are seen as vehicles through which all stakeholders  -  including equity and debt providers, employees, suppliers, customers, and communities  -  pursue their joint interests.; 0
0505.00013; These corporations might tailor their governance arrangements to include all stakeholders and to engage more formally with the interests of each group and with their joint concerns. On this model, directors have duties to all stakeholders and managers are seen as the agents of multiple principals.; 0
0505.00014; It is predicated on the assumption that if corporate strategy disproportionately privileges one group of stakeholders over others, it won't work. It's a political notion, not a legal one.; 0
0505.00015; It comes back into vogue in times when the community thinks the benefits and costs of business are not being shared appropriately, and there is no trust in the political system to address perceived inequalities and long-term societal challenges. I think we are in that environment now. GLC: Do you believe stakeholder capitalism is the way forward for boards?; 0
0505.00016; PH: It is a tempting slogan, but I wouldn't call it the way forward for boards.; 0
0505.00017; I think Australian company law already allows for all the perceived benefits of this approach  -  giving the board as a collective decision-maker responsibility for setting the goals and values for the corporation and for recognising and balancing the interests of different stakeholders.; 0
0505.00018; Investors who provide equity capital expect a return for the risk they take, and boards must ensure the company is properly and responsibly managed to deliver that return.; 0
0505.00019; What it means to manage the company 'properly and responsibly' evolves as circumstances change, and boards must be sensitive to that in setting the strategic direction and in explaining clearly to investors where the value will come from into the future.; 0
0505.00020; Good boards recognise that delivering value to investors over the medium to long term requires them to get the balancing of stakeholder interests right. GLC: Should the board's responsibility to stakeholders, via directors' duties, be enshrined in Australian law, as is the case in the UK through section 172 of The Corporations Act 2006 (UK)?; 0
0505.00021; PH.; 0
0505.00022; No, I am not in favour of a section 172 type provision in Australia. Australian law requires individual directors to exercise their powers and discretions in the best interest of the corporation  -  that's not the same as saying they owe a duty to maximise shareholder returns.; 0
0505.00023; It is a stronger provision than UK section 172, which in some respects pays lip service to these other interests but may actually embed shareholder primacy.; 0
0505.00024; It is not clear that the UK's section 172 requires UK directors to do anything other than put some motherhood statements in the minutes, so I would challenge your question that it enshrines responsibility to stakeholders. Australian directors must balance different stakeholder concerns to arrive at a considered decision about what is best for the corporation.; 0
0505.00025; That is their job  -  it is not always easy and it involves judgement calls. GLC: What are the risks of embedding a responsibility to stakeholders into directors' duties?; 0
0505.00026; PH: Directors already face significant legal risk if they are perceived to have got that stakeholder balancing wrong. Look at James Hardie. Perhaps the parent company could have done what other asbestos businesses did globally and just put the subsidiary into liquidation and walked away.; 0
0505.00027; Instead, the directors tried to establish a mechanism for compensation  -  they got it wrong and ended up being sued for a defective stock exchange announcement.; 0
0505.00028; That's the reality  -  whatever the law says. That said, it's interesting to compare the duty in section166 of the new Indian Companies Act  -  it is that directors must 'act in good faith in order to promote the objects of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole, AND in the best interests of the company, its employees, the shareholders, the community and for the protection of the environment'.; 0
0505.00029; Note the AND in the Indian law.; 0
0505.00030; GLC: Can boards adequately assess the needs of employees, customers, the community, suppliers and regulators in the traditional governance model? Or will we need to see changes in board composition or structure?; 0
0505.00031; PH: This is about the purpose of boards.; 0
0505.00032; Our model works on the basis that, in a private-sector organisation, having a group of (hopefully) reputable, experienced people who must deliberate and arrive at decisions collaboratively, who bring different histories and perspectives to the discussion, knowing they are legally obliged to put the corporation's interests first, is the best approach. A board is not a parliament. Employee-elected directors and two-tiered boards were floated in the UK but rejected, I think for good reason.; 0
0505.00033; In the Australian debate there is a real misunderstanding about two-tier boards and what the supervisory board actually does and why its members are chosen the way they are. They do not run the business.; 0
0505.00034; Can boards adequately assess the different interests? It is already the directors' job to think about how business decisions are impacting different stakeholders.; 0
0505.00035; That is a given.; 0
0505.00036; It is important to get the right non-financial information from management and to communicate openly with all stakeholders  -  including investors  -  about where they propose to strike the balance on these issues.; 0
0505.00037; This determines where the board will position the company on a whole range of important questions from employee rights to climate impact to data governance.; 0
0505.00038; Board skills is an interesting question. I think the case for diversity of thinking and approach is obvious in any group decision-making body.; 0
0505.00039; It is every director's responsibility to engage with the issues and challenges the business faces. But at the end of the day, you are running a business.; 0
0505.00040; If the board needs to hear from advocates for particular interests, they should make sure they do, and if they ignore what they hear in their decision-making, they do so at their peril. Most boards focus on what will benefit their medium- to long-term investors.; 0
0505.00041; It's rarely a question of one group having 'priority' over another  -  it is about how you bring those interests into alignment over the longer term. GLC: What does stakeholder capitalism mean for shareholders and is it right that they might have lower priority than other stakeholders (who don't contribute equity capital) in some board decisions? PH: Shareholders are a diverse group.; 0
0505.00042; Long-term investors don't want the same thing as traders.; 0
0505.00043; Most boards focus on what will benefit their medium- to long-term investors.; 0
0505.00044; It's rarely a question of one group having 'priority' over another  -  it is about how you bring those interests into alignment over the longer term.; 0
0505.00045; Commissioner Hayne (in the Financial Services Royal Commission) took the view that eventually interests converge.; 0
0505.00046; That is not always the case, but it is worth reflecting on. Even in a business that won't exist in 10 years, it's about how to come to a landing that takes account of all legitimate concerns and doesn't buckle to vested interests or political pressure. Remember, many businesses  -  fund managers and listed law practices are good examples  -  already operate on the basis that the interests of beneficiaries or clients must be preferred over the company's interests and this affects all board decisions.; 0
0505.00047; If the government wants to pass a law that says corporate interests must be subordinated to other interests in a particular area it is always open to it to do so, and directors will adjust.; 0
0505.00048; GLC: How do you see the issue of stakeholder capitalism evolving in Australia over the next 10 years? PH: These things run in cycles.; 0
0505.00049; As a lawyer, I am not convinced this latest thought bubble adds much. That said, the idea that boards must consider and balance the impact of corporate decisions on all stakeholders is now accepted, even by the US Business Roundtable, and it is unlikely that will change at least for listed entities.; 0
0505.00050; To me, the more significant issue is about corporate short-termism and that is a discussion that must involve investors and governments, not just boards.; 0
0505.00051; There is a broader discussion we need to have about what is happening politically and how society conceptualises regulation and the relationship between the government, corporations and citizens. I am profoundly concerned about the anti-democratic implications of trying to resolve questions of political and social justice through corporate law.; 0

0506.00001; Big debts and tiny profits  -  is it time to call a halt to latest scheme? Borrowing around £50 million over the last five years has underpinned Hastings Borough Council's commercial property acquisition programme.; 0
0506.00002; Many local people still don't realise that their council owns the site in Sedlescombe Road North where Pets at Home and Dunelm are based and also owns the T.K. Max site on Bexhill Road.; 0
0506.00003; The council has also recently bought Lacuna House in the town centre and is funding the building of the new Aldi store, also in Bexhill Road, which when complete will be rented back to the German supermarket giant.; 0
0506.00004; The stewardship of the council's property portfolio and its acquisition programme has come in for a deal of criticism especially at at time when there are warnings that many councils are over extending themselves to buy property at the top of the market. HBC has funded its buying spree by taking low interest loans from the Public Works Loan Board which it is committed to for 40 years which last year led the leader of the Conservative group on the council Rob Lee to warn that HBC was facing a 'a ticking time bomb of over extended borrowing'.; 0
0506.00005; Mr Lee is not alone in his concern that some of HBC's recent purchases carry a significant financial risk, many of the sites the council has acquired recently are reliant on the health of retail and that sector of the nation's economy is seriously under pressure as more shopping is done online and even some of the biggest names in retail struggle to make a profit. There is also concern that the yield  -  or profit  -  HBC is achieving on its property investments is far too low.; 0
0506.00006; It's concerns surrounding that return on the council's investment which has seen Mr Lee on the attack again, this time over York Buildings in the heart of Hastings town centre. The striking building with its black glazed bricks is home to Millets which occupies the ground floor. The whole building is owned by HBC but the floors above the shop are empty and derelict.; 0
0506.00007; Lacuna Place in Havelock Road, one of the council's most recent acquisitions.; 0
0506.00008; Plans have been put forward for the council to turn them into flats to create much needed additional homes.; 0
0506.00009; The proposed flats would be rented out at the low housing authority rate to create affordable housing.; 0
0506.00010; Mr Lee says: What follows though is good example of what goes wrong when a local council gets involved with market forces it doesn't fully understand. The original proposals to restore and create the flats on the upper floors were very expensive with the total refurbishment costing £757,000 or £126,000 per flat, despite the whole building being only worth around £500,000.; 1
0506.00011; My deputy, Councillor Andy Patmore put forward a sensible suggestion that the top floors should be sold off at auction with a covenant that the refurbishment of the flats takes place within two years. This would have provided a useful cash injection for the council which could have been reinvested and it would also have taken away the liability of the dilapidated building but the suggestion was dismissed out of hand.; 0
0506.00012; Now, just a few months later the plans have come back, the only real change is an adjustment to the cost which has now climbed to a staggering £846,000 for the refurbishment or £141,000 per flat.; 1
0506.00013; That's an increase of 12 per cent. The enormous cost of this scheme will predictably be met entirely by taking out further loans to be paid back over 40 years. The council does hope to take in some income through renting out the flats but the margins are tiny.; 0
0506.00014; They anticipate making only £1,971 profit a year which equates to less than 0.25 per cent profit a year on the costs of the refurbishment and as usual the council have not allowed for void periods or repairs to the building over the 40-year life of the loan.; 1
0506.00015; The intention among among Labour councillors was that the flats were to rented out at low, affordable rates. However, under closer inspection, the anticipated rental income from these flats indicates that the rents will be far higher than the Local Housing Allowance would be for flats of this size.; 0
0506.00016; The project is too expensive and does not provide affordable housing to those who need it most and it should be stopped at once.; 0

0507.00001; Wednesday, September 25, 2019 Langley City council meets with provincial ministers to advocate for more supportive services to reduce homelessness, and to create a fairer property tax system This week, the annual Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM) conference is taking place at Canada Place in Downtown Vancouver.; 0
0507.00002; This conference provides an opportunity for people involved in local government to learn about how other local governments are addressing complex challenges, debate and pass resolutions to forward to the provincial government for consideration, and meet with provincial government ministers and staff.; 0
0507.00003; Every year, Langley City council discusses which ministers we would like to speak with. Once that is decided, we determine who on council will speak with each minister. We tend to split up into smaller cohorts as to not overwhelm provincial ministers.; 0
0507.00004; I was assigned, along with Councillor Rosemary Wallace, Councillor Paul Albrecht, and Francis Cheung who is the Chief Administrative Officer of Langley City to speak with Carole James who is the Minister of Finance and Judy Darcy who is the Minister of Mental Health & Addiction.; 0
0507.00005; As the ministers meet with many people who are elected to, and work in local governments, we got fifteen minutes per meeting.; 0
0507.00006; With Minister Darcy, we commended the province through BC Housing for building 49 units of supportive housing in Langley for people to get off the street and into housing with supports.; 0
0507.00007; These supportive services help transition people to independent living over time.; 0
0507.00008; We also commended the province through Fraser Health for funding a Langley ICM team which helps people who are living on the streets and who have substance-use issues get stabilized and into housing. Supportive Housing and the ICM team are how we reduce homelessness in Langley.; 0
0507.00009; While the supportive housing facility near the Home Depot on 200th Street isn't open yet, it will be at capacity when it does.; 0
0507.00010; The ICM team is already at capacity.; 0
0507.00011; Late last year, council wrote to the Ministry of Health asking for additional resources for the ICM team.; 0
0507.00012; We noted to Minister Darcy that while a new supportive housing facility and current ICM team is a good start, with over 200 people living on the streets in Langley, we will need more resources.; 0
0507.00013; Minister Darcy noted that she would look into it.; 0
0507.00014; She also noted a new program which will provides a one-time grant of up to $50,000 to fund projects such as needle distribution and recovery programs.; 1
0507.00015; After meeting with Minister Darcy, we met with Minister James about creating two property tax classes: one class for single-family housing and another class for multi-family housing. Currently, there is only one residential property tax class.; 0
0507.00016; This means that even if there is no increase in property tax revenue collected by the City, people will see wild year-over-year swings in their property tax bill due to the different rate of appreciation between multi-family and single-family housing.; 0
0507.00017; Minister James took some notes about this.; 0
0507.00018; This is the second year we have spoken to Minister James about creating two residential property tax classes.; 0
0507.00019; We also asked for an update on cannabis revenue sharing between the province and local governments. We were told that this is currently being studied.; 0
0507.00020; The UBCM conference is a good opportunity to meet with people elected to provincial government, and I was happy to advocate on behalf of Langley City residents with other members of council.

0508.00002; Remember, AEP (the Medicare Annual Enrollment Period) only lasts from October 15 through December 7.; 0
0508.00003; Anyone enrolled in Medicare can make use of the AEP, but you only have seven weeks to close all of those sales.; 0
0508.00004; Plus, Thanksgiving falls right in the middle of all of that, taking away valuable sales time.; 0
0508.00005; Make sure that you can make full use of those seven weeks by getting completely prepared NOW!; 0

Friendly Reminder: What can Your Clients do During AEP? AEP is the time when your clients can make virtually any change that they are eligible for.; 0
0508.00007; That may include: Enroll in Medicare Advantage for the first time Switch from one Medicare Advantage plan to another Join a Medicare prescription drug plan Switch from one prescription drug plan to another Drop prescription drug coverage completely Remember that your clients can enroll in Medicare Supplements (or drop their Medigap coverage) at any time  -  though if it is not their initial enrollment period, it may not be guaranteed issue.; 0
0508.00008; The Medicare Sales Timeline It's important to understand when all of the yearly changes are made to understand when you need to be preparing for AEP.; 0
0508.00009; January-May: Carriers begin working on and submitting new plans to CMS for approval for the following plan year. June-July: Certifications for the following plan year become available August: Benefit sneak peeks begin (sometimes sooner) even if they are still pending CMS final approval.; 0

0508.00011; However, you cannot market to them during this time. Preparing for AEP Sales While the commissions may be great, there are a few things you have to do before you can jump into AEP.; 0

0508.00013; Start with Your Existing Book of Business Once you've done all that, it's time to start reaching out to your existing book of clients. It's best to start with the people who already remember your name. You may be able to book yourself up before you know it!; 0

Setting S.M.A.R.T. goals can keep you on track and hold you accountable for having a successful AEP.; 0
0508.00018; S.M.A.R.T. stands for specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and timely. Writing down your goals and turning them into S.M.A.R.T. goals can turn your entire AEP strategy around. Your goals should stretch you but be reasonable.; 0
0508.00019; They should include concrete numbers that you can write down and easily keep track of. Consider setting a goal for the amount of appointments you want to attend during AEP and for the amount of policies you want to sell.; 0
0508.00020; If you've done this before, you can even use math from your past years to calculate how many appointments you would need to attend to meet your sales goals.; 0
0508.00021; For example, if your close rate is about 20% (you sell policies on about 20% of your appointments), and you want to sell at least 20 policies during AEP, then you should set at least 100 appointments.; 1

0509.00001; The Finance Minister addressed a press conference on Friday (20/09/2019), announcing a series of measures to boost the economy. One of the major announcements was the slashing of corporate tax rates to 22% from the existing 30% for domestic companies. This means that a domestic company can pay tax at 22% without exemptions.; 1
0509.00002; The net tax rate would be 25.17% including surcharges and cess.; 0
0509.00003; New domestic manufacturing companies will be taxed at 15% to attract investments and give thrust to the Make-in-India initiative.; 1
0509.00004; The effective tax rate for these companies will be 17.01% inclusive of surcharge and cess. Also, these companies need not pay Minimum Alternate Tax of 15%.; 0
0509.00005; These reliefs come in the light of meetings the Finance Minister held with various representatives from the industry over the past two weeks. Another noteworthy step is the expansion of 2% CSR spending to incubators under Central and State Governments as well as PSUs.; 0
0509.00006; This will allow flow of funds to public funded universities, IITs, CSIR Labs that engage in research in the fields of science, technology, engineering and medicine.; 0
0509.00007; A uniform tax rate on all companies simplifies the taxation process and also ensures compliance.; 0
0509.00008; India has one of the highest corporate taxes ranging from 25-40%.; 0
0509.00009; An expert committee that submitted a report on direct tax to the government suggested keeping a flat corporate tax rate of 25%. The government has gone a step ahead and has slashed the rate to 22%. These measures have been made through the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Ordinance 2019 that seeks to amend the Income Tax Act 1961 and Finance Act 2019.; 1
0509.00010; The tax sops will give companies more elbow room to make capital investments which will stimulate the economy by creating more demand and employment opportunities.; 0
0510.00001; When it comes to parents and the workplace, there are promises and then there's reality. That was certainly the case for Elena Thormahlen, a former sales manager at a large Florida-based company.; 0
0510.00002; This company was very proud to be employee-friendly, with attractive benefits for parents, she says. But actually using the benefits was a whole different thing.; 0
0510.00003; Working as one of many customer relationship managers, Thormahlen went through a pregnancy and birth and returned to her position with no issues. In time, she was promoted to a sales management position.; 0
0510.00004; About three months into her new role, she became pregnant again.; 0
0510.00005; That's when her problems started. I was in a position of dealing directly with the executive suite, but there was only one person in this role and this pregnancy was treated entirely differently, Thormahlen says.; 0
0510.00006; I was terminated just a couple of months into my pregnancy, while at a doctor's office, for missing too much work [due to medical appointments].; 0
0510.00007; She says her employer never offered to provide her with time off for doctor visits under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).; 0
0510.00008; Thormahlen was left in the lurch at a very vulnerable time. Although I was able to get interviews for new positions, she says, showing up to job interviews six months pregnant did not get me a lot of callbacks. I was left high and dry, she recalls, without a job and without health insurance, which she could not afford.; 0
0510.00009; I had to get unemployment, food stamps, Women Infant & Children [WIC benefits] and Medicaid.; 0
0510.00010; It was a genuine reality check about just how vulnerable a pregnant employee really is.; 0
0510.00011; Thormahlen eventually found a new job as vice president of business development at Meridian Insurance Services in Nevada. I never imagined as a salaried and decently paid employee that I'd be in the position to be sitting in the welfare office after just a few months, she says, but that's where I ended up.; 0
0510.00012; It's an experience I won't soon forget.; 0
0510.00013; Missing the Mark  Many parents, especially women, face career challenges when they exercise their right to parental leave benefits.; 0
0510.00014; In some companies, their advancement prospects and even job security may be at risk.; 0
0510.00015; What child care provider Bright Horizons calls the motherhood penalty is still very much alive in corporate America and across the globe.; 0
0510.00016; Seventy-two percent of working parents in the U.S. agree that women are penalized in their careers for starting families.; 0
0510.00017; Men aren't penalized as severely, but they can still face backlash.; 0
0510.00018; How is that scenario possible in this day and age?; 0
0510.00019; As much as it pains me to say it, I think that some employers do have an unspoken issue with employees taking parental leave, and that's very problematic, says Stephen Hart, chief executive officer at Cardswitcher, a Glasgow, Scotland-based company. He says leaders at some businesses are worried about the perceived cost of parental leave, including the time and energy needed to find a temporary replacement for the person on leave.; 0
0510.00020; Of course, it's not easy to make up for the absence of a staffer who must take maternity or paternity leave, but it's what companies need to do.; 0
0510.00021; In the short term, an employee's pregnancy will likely impede her ability to do the job, but this is why maternity leave exists, says Matt Dunne, hiring manager at Africa Travel in Capetown, South Africa. It's fair to hire someone to provide temporary cover while the permanent employee is away on maternity leave, but not to replace them altogether, as this would be punishing them for making a fair and unrelated personal decision.; 0
0510.00022; Additionally, whether an individual is a parent or not should play no role in hiring and promotions.; 0
0510.00023; Such decisions should instead be based purely on the individual's skills, abilities and credentials, Dunne says. Clearly, an employee should never feel like their career is stopping them from starting a family, he adds. The fact is that personal circumstances, such as having a child, usually don't affect an employee's ability to do the job.; 0
0510.00024; Parental leave benefits and flexible work policies can help position an organization as an employer of choice, says Kris Dunn, a partner and CHRO at Kinetix, a national RPO firm for growth companies headquartered in Atlanta. A Caring Culture  By providing parents with the time off they need to care for their children, employers convey a meaningful message. If you truly value your employees as human beings and want to help them grow as people over the long term at your company, then you'll give them the necessary time off to celebrate one of the most important moments in life―the birth of a new child, Hart says.; 0
0510.00025; If employers turn their backs on parents, they'll have to live with the consequences.; 0
0510.00026; Don't be surprised when employees get demotivated, become inefficient and move elsewhere, Hart says. There are encouraging signs that more U.S. companies understand the importance of time off for parents.; 0
0510.00027; In recent years, an increasing number of employers began offering maternity, paternity and other parental leave, according to the Society for Human Resource Management. The percentage of companies offering paid maternity leave, for example, increased from 26 percent in 2016 to 35 percent in 2018.; 1
0510.00028; But in many cases, staffers are too scared to request time off, even if a policy is in place, Dunne says.; 0
0510.00029; According to the Bright Horizons survey, 1 out of 5 working mothers is nervous to tell her boss that she's pregnant. This fear comes from the workplace culture, Dunne says.; 0
0510.00030; He warns against a sterile, impersonal environment and encourages HR professionals to be welcoming and understanding so that staff members feel they can walk in and discuss their situations.; 0
0510.00031; By creating an approachable, friendly atmosphere, companies remove the unnecessarily formal processes and minimize the hassle for those who simply need the time to take care of themselves and their family, Dunne says. Getting It Right Early On  Some companies try to get ahead of the parental leave issue by establishing firm but generous policies on day one of an employee's tenure.; 0
0510.00032; That's the case at Wilmington, N.C.-based N2 Publishing, a producer of neighborhood publications. HR manager Gina Foshage says the company was founded in 2004 with a straightforward mission: honor God, strengthen the family and create financial wealth for everyone involved. Here, no parental penalty exists, says Foshage, a new mom herself who welcomed her first child last year.; 0
0510.00033; N2 Publishing was founded with a mission that includes strengthening the family, so right from the beginning, we knew we wanted to be a family-friendly workplace, she says.

0510.00053; -  Employers are coming to terms (sometimes with legal prodding) with the fact that it's not just mothers who need parental leave. Fathers do, too. Exhibit A is JPMorgan Chase, which recently settled a paternity leave case for $5 million.; 1
0510.00054; The class action case centered on Derek Rotondo, a financial crime investigator at the banking giant.; 0
0510.00055; Rotondo claimed that JPMorgan Chase offered him only two weeks of parental leave, despite the companywide policy of providing 16 weeks for family primary caregivers. According to legal documents, the investment bank's HR department told Rotondo that mothers were broadly considered primary caregivers, and thus they were the only parent eligible for the full 16 weeks of paid parental leave.; 0
0510.00056; Meanwhile, fathers could take only two weeks of paid parental leave unless their spouses were incapacitated or had already returned to the workplace.; 0
0510.00057; The lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the law firm Outten & Golden LLP, is billed by the ACLU as the first class-action lawsuit to settle sex-discrimination claims for a class of fathers who claimed they were denied the opportunity to receive paid parental leave equal to that given to mothers.; 0
0510.00058; The settlement calls on JP Morgan Chase to:  Maintain a gender-neutral parental leave policy. Train HR staffers and managers on how to administer a gender-neutral parental leave policy. Pay $5 million to company dads who said they were blocked by the bank from leveraging additional paid parental leave as primary caregivers.; 1
0510.00059; The lawsuit covers new ground for companies grappling with the issue of parental leave and the legal definition of the term primary caregiver. While 16 weeks of parental leave is quite generous, and we wish more companies would follow Chase's lead, caregiving leave must also be offered on an equal basis to men and women, says Galen Sherwin, senior staff attorney with the ACLU's Women's Rights Project.

The move was expected to guide investors in understanding the asset allocation of funds and simplifying the comparison of similar schemes.; 0
0512.00003; A significant benefit of the re-categorisation is that it has reduced overlapping of schemes that have very minute difference with similar asset allocation.; 0

0512.00005; Some investors believe both are the same and just that it has multiple names. The primary difference is that small and mid-cap funds invest in equity shares of companies that are classified under small and medium market capitalisation while the multi-cap funds invest across equity shares of companies of all market capitalisations.; 0

0514.00001; Operations & Technology  By Shahira Raineri  Updated June 25, 2019  There are many reasons that your business should find and retain a business lawyer to address your legal needs.; 0
0514.00002; Having an attorney on retainer ensures that you will not have to scramble to find the right lawyer at a time of legal difficulty.; 0
0514.00003; By having a business attorney on retainer, you can have the advantage of time to work out a prudent legal strategy with your attorney -- hence increasing your chances to prevail.; 0
0514.00004; By having an attorney on retainer before any legal troubles begin, the attorney that will help you will already be familiar with your business and will have the advantage of a head start on the type of services or products your company offers.; 0
0514.00005; Your attorney's upfront familiarity with your company can help to streamline the process of working through legal issues when the time comes.; 0
0514.00006; Paul Bradbury/Caiaimage/Getty Images  At the onset of the development of the corporation, the counsel and advice from an attorney can prove invaluable as you work through which type of business you want to create and why. In the United States, for example, a new company can be incorporated as an LLC (Limited Liability Corporation), as a C-Corp or as an S-Corp. Each type of these business incorporations has a unique structure and significant tax implications.; 0
0514.00007; This is why it is best to retain an attorney before even submitting the paperwork for the business incorporation to make sure that the structure you select will meet both your short term and longer term profit targets and partnerships if any.; 0
0514.00008; 02  Business Partner(s) As human beings, we inherently expect that other individuals, especially business partners that were carefully screened and selected will act in good faith and honor their fiduciary duties to the company. Often, to make sure that all business partners live up to their obligations, we have an attorney draft a partnership agreement that is executed by all partners.; 0
0514.00009; The purpose of a partnership agreement is to clearly outline each partner's expectation of the other partner(s). The agreement can also include the specific responsibilities and fiduciary duties of each partner.; 0
0514.00010; You do not want to make the mistake of finding out two years into the business that your business partner is a fraud that hastily abandons the business when times get tough.; 0
0514.00011; Without the benefit of a partnership agreement up front, the remaining partner(s) has only expensive litigations options to pursue the dishonest partner.; 0
0514.00012; Employees can and do sue their bosses and the companies that they work for when they believe that they have been harmed in some way as a result of their employment. An employee may claim, for example, that are working in a hostile work environment and file a lawsuit for this reason.; 0
0514.00013; There are many other reasons why employers become frustrated enough to file a lawsuit.; 0
0514.00014; Exercise proper performance management and inspiring leadership, and chances are, these good practices will minimize the amount of employee dissatisfaction to the level of a lawsuit. Be prepared for an employee lawsuit if it happens by consulting with your retained attorney.; 0
0514.00015; Even if your business attorney is not a litigation attorney, she/he can recommend an expert in that area and help brief them about the case. Every business, whatever its size has a contractor or vendor that they have negotiated and executed contracts with. A rigorous process was likely used to ensure that the contract terms were fair for both sides and had reasonable expectations on the part of the buyer and seller of a service or product.; 0
0514.00016; In this scenario, the business is the buyer, and the contractor or vendor is the seller. Often, a business attorney can step in with an informal letter to the vendor and inform them of their breach of the contract, if one occurs.; 0
0514.00017; A breach of contract can range from an inability to deliver the product or service in the timeframe prescribed in the contract providing low quality or inferior products or services or providing no service or product at all.; 0
0514.00018; The retained attorney can help to work with the vendor to demand what is owed and hopefully avoid further escalation of the breach of contract.; 0
0514.00019; Using the retained attorney in this manner can be a huge money and time saver.; 0
0514.00020; Finally, and most importantly, in order to maintain profitable operations for the business, it is important to recognize that attorneys cannot be replaced by an App or a software package or any other technology. Business attorneys are highly skilled and specialized lawyers whose services help to legally protect the business. The internet can be a great resource to answer simple legal questions, but a retained business attorney can manage the situation through complex laws and court processes.; 0
0514.00021; There are several websites that offer background data and customer reviews about business attorneys.; 0
0514.00022; For example, avvo.com provides contact information for various types of attorneys and users are able to post specific questions that are answered by experts in their specific area of practice.; 0
0514.00023; This site can help to streamline the process of finding and retaining the right lawyer for your business.; 0

0517.00003; NEW DELHI: With a lower tax rate for new manufacturers, the government is looking to attract investment flowing out of China following its trade dispute with the US, but experts say India needs to also remove other major obstacles for multinationals to consider it as an alternative destination to the neighbouring country. The 15% rate  -  17% after including a cess and surcharge  -  that finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced on Friday is among the lowest in South and Southeast Asia.; 1
0517.00004; The government hopes it will make India more appealing to multinational manufacturers that are preferring countries such as Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand and Malaysia.; 0
0517.00005; More than 50 MNCs including Apple, Dell, HP and Nintendo have either partly moved out of China in the past one year, or are in the process of shifting their production bases.; 0
0517.00006; Even Chinese electronics company TCL has been reported to be moving its TV production to Vietnam, while tyre maker Sailun Tire is transitioning its manufacturing line to Thailand.; 0
0517.00007; Bringing down the corporate tax rate to 15% for new manufacturing is a deep cut. In the medium term it will be one of the major consideration for companies to shift base from China to India, said DK Joshi, principal economist at Crisil.; 1
0517.00008; Though the government is doing alot to improve ease of doing business, more needs to be done as other countries are still better off than India, Joshi added. Inadequate infrastructure, delays in land acquisitions, stringent labour laws and high tax rates have come in the way of India to benefit from the trade war between Washington and Beijing, despite the country offering a huge domestic market as well to investors.; 0
0517.00009; While the proposed tax rate is on a par with those in countries like Vietnam and Myanmar  -  which tax corporate profits at 15% to 20%  -  other hindrances remain and those too need to be removed, said experts. Make in India primarily means manufacturing, which depends on a whole list of things including land acquisitions and labour reforms, said Bibek Debroy, the chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister.; 0
0517.00010; Land is a state subject while labour is in the concurrent list.; 0
0517.00011; Hence, we will have to see all these measures in aggregate.; 0
0517.00012; Finance minister Sitharaman said the government would allow any new domestic company incorporated on or after October 1, 2019 and making fresh investment in manufacturing to pay income tax at 15% as well as exemptions from the minimum alternate tax, provided it did not avail of any exemption or incentive and commences production by March 31, 2023.; 1
0517.00013; Adding the cess and surcharge, the effective tax rate for these companies will be 17.01%.; 1

Fine prints will have to be examined to see how this will work for companies carrying out composite operations.

0520.00001; STOCKHOLM, Sept. 26, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- As previously disclosed, Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC) has been co-operating voluntarily since 2013 with an investigation by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and, since 2015, with an investigation by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) into Ericsson's compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the process is still ongoing. The investigation covers a period ending Q1 2017 and revealed breaches of the Company's Code of Business Ethics and the FCPA in six countries: China, Djibouti, Indonesia, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam.; 0
0520.00002; The company previously communicated that the resolution of the investigations will result in material financial and other measures.; 0
0520.00003; While Ericsson cannot comment in detail on the ongoing process with the U.S. authorities, the Company can with current visibility now estimate the cost and thus make a provision, which will impact the third quarter 2019 results by SEK 12 b. The provision constitutes the Company's current estimate of expenditure related to resolving the U.S. investigations, of which the combined monetary sanctions from SEC and DOJ is estimated at USD 1 b., and the remainder pertains to other costs related to resolving the investigation.; 0
0520.00004; The provision will be booked as Other Operating Expenses in the income statement of Segment Emerging Business and Other.; 0
0520.00005; In the course of the investigations, the Company identified breaches of its Code of Business Ethics and the FCPA.; 0
0520.00006; It is the Company's assessment that the breaches are the result of several deficiencies, including a failure to react to red flags and inadequate internal controls which enabled a limited number of employees to actively circumvent internal controls for illegitimate purposes. Disciplinary measures, including terminations where appropriate, have been taken against identified individuals determined to have breached the Code of Business Ethics.; 0
0520.00007; Ericsson has acted to address shortcomings and is significantly enhancing its Ethics & Compliance program, to ensure that the Company is equipped to do business the right way.; 0

0521.00001; Anne Sulzberger September 19, 2019 0  There is now widespread anxiety over the future of work, often accompanied by calls for a basic income to protect those displaced by automation and other technological changes.; 0
0521.00002; As a labour economist, I am in favour of more efficient redistributive taxation through the application of refundable tax credits, which amounts to an income-tested basic income or negative income tax.; 0
0521.00003; But I am more skeptical about the spectre of a future without work. And if the future isn't scarred by massive, widespread technological unemployment, a basic income would be neither outrageously expensive nor the be-all and end-all of the policy measures that society needs. The reasons for my skepticism about a future without work rests in the evidence to date.; 0
0521.00004; First, the long history of technological displacement of workers has coincided with massive job creation, a process known as creative destruction that Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter recognized as the heart of economic progress.; 0
0521.00005; From the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, there has been significant anxiety about technological unemployment without much evidence to support it over the short or long term.; 0
0521.00006; Second, Canada's own record has been one of modernization and transition and corresponding job obsolescence, without job scarcity. Our employment rate has risen steadily from 53 per cent in 1946 to more than 61 per cent today, despite rising school attendance rates and earlier retirement. Our inability to foresee the jobs of the future should be tempered by the realization that they have always appeared in the past.; 0
0521.00007; Don't get me wrong. My skepticism about a jobless future driven by automation doesn't ignore the substantial disruption each and every technological wave has introduced.; 0
0521.00008; Jobs are displaced just as new jobs are created. Older workers in established occupations often bear the brunt of this progress, as the long history of the displacement of factory workers by machines and robots illustrates. Technological game-changers Indeed, one important cause for concern at this time is the growing pace of technological change and the notion that artificial intelligence and machine learning will be a real game-changer.; 0
0521.00009; This is a valid concern, one that makes worker flexibility and adaptability more important than ever before.; 0
0521.00010; Other causes for concern are the growing international evidence of greater inequality of earnings and incomes and wage stagnation for less educated workers since the 1980s.; 0
0521.00011; Research in the United States explains the wage stagnation of less educated workers in terms of shifting job opportunities. More specifically, the research classifies jobs as low, middle and high skill.; 0
0521.00012; It finds that middle-skill production, office and sales occupations of non-college-educated workers have disappeared and been replaced by low-skill manual and service occupations, particularly in urban areas where wages are higher. For college-educated workers, on the other hand, the disappearing middle-skill jobs have been replaced with high-skill professional, technical and managerial occupations.; 0
0521.00013; My preliminary research matches this skill classification by occupation to Census microdata from 1971 to 2016 to see if there are comparable developments in Canada. Interestingly, there's no evidence that middle-skill jobs are disappearing in Canada, according to my findings.; 0
0521.00014; Rather, I've observed a steady decline in low-skill manual and service occupations throughout the period from 1971 to 2016.; 0
0521.00015; This decline is coupled with a decline in middle-skill production, office and sales occupations between 1981 and 2001 that reversed between 2001 to 2016, and a steady increase in high-skill professional, technical and managerial occupations, especially up to 2001.  Low-skill jobs have fallen in Canada from 38 per cent to 25 per cent of all employment between 1971 and 2016, and high-skill jobs have correspondingly increased from 20 per cent to 34 per cent of all jobs. Middle-skill jobs have remained steady at about 42 per cent of all employment in the Canadian economy throughout the period, a better scenario than in the U.S.  Middle-skill jobs, including skilled trades in manufacturing and construction and white-collar secretarial and administrative jobs, remain accessible to all education groups.; 0
0521.00016; The proportion of middle-skill jobs for workers without post-secondary education actually rose from 41 to 45 per cent while falling only modestly for workers with a university degree. 'Marked and steady' What's more, my initial research has found that the decline in low-skill jobs is more marked and steady for workers without post-secondary education than for college workers, and the small decline in low-skill employment for college workers occurred entirely between 1971 and 1981.; 0
0521.00017; Both workers with university degrees and workers without post-secondary education have experienced growth in high-skill jobs the dichotomy found in the U.S. does not show up in the Canadian data, perhaps simply a reflection of differing industrial structures. Whatever the reason, these more optimistic findings, especially for workers with less education, may account for more moderate income inequality in Canada.; 0
0521.00018; But they also point to significant changes in employee skill requirements that must often be dealt with mid-career. Rather than obsessing about mass technological unemployment, of which there's scant evidence so far, we'd better make sure that our education and training programs, as well as our income support programs, are up to the task of preparing Canadians for the more sophisticated job requirements of the 21st century.; 0

Where they agree is on this bottom line: even if the index is not going to keep rising at the pace it has over the last 40 years, equities are still the best asset class to beat inflation.; 0
0523.00006; As for their separate arguments, Fraser-Jenkins says there are plenty of reasons that the S&P can't go higher than 4,000. Chiefly, he points to evidence that equities are expensive using the Shiller cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (a popular stock-valuation measure). Also, low yields and baby boomers pouring money into stocks have helped keep the S&P moving up, and household equity allocation is at an all-time high, he says.; 1

0525.00005; Westbank has combined individual property rights, in the form of certificates of possession, with a system of government enabling these rights to become useful in the economy. The lesson is that neither property rights nor government can succeed on their own, but the two together can become a powerful engine of wealth creation. To be most effective, property rights must be supported by a government that defines and records these rights, enforces them impartially under the rule of law, and supports owners with services and utilities such as roadways, police and fire protection, water and sewerage and other amenities required to make property development attractive.; 0
0525.00006; Story continues below advertisement  As reserve land started to acquire potential economic value in the 1960s, Westbank members obtained certificates and used them to grant leases for trailer parks.; 0
0525.00007; But governmental institutions were weak, and economic development led to internal conflict, with many charges of secrecy and favouritism.; 0
0525.00008; A commission of inquiry, appointed in 1986, set Westbank on the path of governmental reform.; 0
0525.00009; The end result was a self-government agreement with Canada enacted by federal legislation in 2005, which allowed the First Nation to escape the strictures of the Indian Act.; 0
0525.00010; Its constitution has made its government open and accountable, with positive affects upon the real estate market.; 0
0525.00011; The total assessed value of Westbank lands rose more than 600 per cent (after inflation) from 2005 to 2019. Most of that value has been created by holders of certificates (now known as allotments) leasing their lands for residential development, while the Westbank government has also leased community land for commercial projects such as shopping centres.; 1
0525.00012; Leases are typically for 99 years or even longer, giving tenants something close to the certainty of fee-simple ownership.; 0
0525.00013; Tenants who are not Westbank members do not have the right to vote for the First Nation chief and council, but they are consulted through a residents' advisory council that they do elect. Property taxes are assessed according to British Columbia standards in consultation with the First Nations Tax Commission.; 0
0525.00014; Thus tenants are not subjected to the sudden and arbitrary tax increases that have sometimes occurred on First Nation lands elsewhere.; 0

0525.00016; Although some have been profitable, there were two notable setbacks  -  investment in the Northland Bank, which went bankrupt in 1985 and the costly failure of a proposal to build a medical clinic, which led to the defeat of the incumbent chief in 2016.; 0

0525.00018; It is sometimes mistakenly asserted that First Nations are inherently collectivist and have no conception of private property, but Westbank members have embraced private property in the forms of allotments and supporting mechanisms such as leases, mortgages, contracts and property tax.; 0
0525.00019; The result is a thriving real estate economy that provides benefits both for the First Nation's members and the far more numerous non-members who now live on Westbank lands.; 0
0525.00020; It is a win-win situation, in which First Nation success benefits the larger society. Each First Nation must find its own path to prosperity not all will want to follow what Westbank has done.; 0
0525.00021; Others may prefer the model of community capitalism (band-owned enterprise) practiced by the Fort McKay First Nation in the heart of Alberta's oil sands. But these and other paths to prosperity have one thing in common: First Nations move away from dependence on government to self-supporting participation in the Canadian economy.; 0

0526.00007; Under the revised plan, Thomas Cook's bondholders would have been able to hold shares in Fosun itself, rather than the British company's travel agency business. However, that proposal had also been withdrawn, prompting a number of bondholders to abandon support for the rescue package.; 0

0527.00001; News  Infometrics shows that council debt levels have been rising over the last decade and are scheduled to rise further in the next decade as revenues are insufficient for replacement projects, let alone growth projects  26th Sep 19, 8:00am  by Brad Olsen  Image sourced from Shutterstock.com  With local elections in full swing, there's a greater focus on the direction that our councils are moving towards and how much is it going to cost.; 0
0527.00002; Wrapped up in these discussions is the the fact that right across New Zealand we need to address our infrastructure deficit after decades of neglect.; 0
0527.00003; Planning to address this deficit will not be easy, or cheap, but is critical to aiding growth and fixing our housing issues.; 0
0527.00004; Our latest analysis shows that debt levels are increasing over the next decade, with a focus on replacement of existing infrastructure rather than investing to accommodate growth.; 0
0527.00005; With increasingly thorny issues around housing and productivity remaining, councils will need new funding streams to allow New Zealand to grow and remain prosperous.; 0
0527.00006; Local government debt heads above 200% of income  Debt levels in councils continues to increase as population pressures, tourism growth, and aging infrastructure come together to form a perfect storm. Comparing total liabilities to operating income is a common way of comparing debt levels among councils and is a similar concept as house-price-to-income ratios. Total local council liabilities (debt) in New Zealand is expected to rise to 205% of operating income (income) on average over the next decade, up from 176% on average over the previous decade.; 1
0527.00007; Debt ratios across New Zealand councils have been increasing over recent years (see Graph 1) and are expected to remain broadly around their current levels. Graph 1  Looking at historical and future debt tracks, Christchurch City Council is expected to rise from being the 10th most indebted council over the last decade (2009-18), to the most indebted over the next decade (2019-28).; 0
0527.00008; Substantial investment to ensure that Christchurch's infrastructure assets are back to pre-earthquake levels drives this higher debt profile, with significant spending occurring to upgrade water assets. Auckland is shuffled into second place over the next decade, down from the most indebted council over the 2009-18 period, while Kapiti Coast District Council remains the third most indebted council. A full list of debt ratios can be found at the end of this article.; 0
0527.00009; Of all 77 local council areas examined (including regional, district and city councils, as well as all unitary authorities), 51 are expecting to see an increase in their debt levels relative to income, leaving just 26 with a declining debt profile. Yet even this increase in debt is conservative, with a larger increase needed in reality to deal with both replacement of assets and coping with current and future growth.; 0
0527.00010; Funding is the major constraint, not debt  Higher debt ratios don't necessarily show that councils are borrowing too much.; 0
0527.00011; Instead, high debt ratios can sometimes more accurately highlight a lack of income needed to grow, even as the population has grown. Increased infrastructure across the country will be used by not just today's population, but for generations to come.; 0
0527.00012; Given the useful life of an asset, funding infrastructure through debt actually allows for intergenerational equity, as the debt repayments allow for the cost of infrastructure to be spread across the various generations that use the asset.; 0
0527.00013; It's often said that councils, like households and others, shouldn't live outside their means.; 0
0527.00014; However, with households highly likely to purchase a home using a mortgage (that is, taking on debt), it's clear to see that investing for the future is a wise move, as long as the investment is on the right assets.; 0
0527.00015; The need to fund increasing capital investments in infrastructure means that different funding options are important going forward.; 0
0527.00016; Recent research from Local Government New Zealand and the New Zealand Initiative have found that local government in New Zealand receives the smallest comparative share of total government funding in the developed world.; 0
0527.00017; The small share of funding shows the need for more funding from central government to local government, either as pure cash payments, or as project-based subsidies, to increase council funding.; 0
0527.00018; The recent Productivity Commission report into local government funding also outlined other alternative funding options, including:  Payments from central to local government based on building work put in place Use of special purpose vehicles to fund infrastructure More funding from tourism levies (national or local)  A focus on replacement at the expense of growth  Councils face a tough choice in the future, with many competing issues and a small pool of money.; 0
0527.00019; Over the next decade, councils are currently expected to replace rundown assets, ahead of projects which would improve service levels or add more capacity to cope with growth. Of the $91 bln in capital spending on the four network infrastructure areas (roading, water supply, stormwater, and wastewater) over the next decade, councils across New Zealand are intending to allocate 46% to replacing existing assets (see Graph 2). Around a third (31%) will be spent on improving levels of service, while only 23% will be spent to meet additional demand.; 1
0527.00020; Graph 2  Most council capital spending is currently geared towards keeping the status quo and fixing rundown assets. But this gearing comes at the expense of investment for the future, with increased tourism and population levels.; 0
0527.00021; Integrated infrastructure critical to current and future success  With at least $129 bln in infrastructure funding expected to be built over the next decade, and a housing undersupply still existing, a coordinated attempt to integrate infrastructure spending is critical to success in addressing high housing costs.; 0
0527.00022; Increasing local council debt ratios, and a focus on replacements before additions, highlight a need for more infrastructure funding to local government. But with household costs increasing, yet again many in the 2019 local elections will be calling for no to low rates rises.; 0
0527.00023; In the absence of increased local government income, central government should support local communities by setting aside funding for infrastructure.; 0
0527.00024; Failure to do so will continue to exacerbate New Zealand's infrastructure deficit and see housing issues increase even further.; 0
0527.00025; Note: Due to the 2016 Kaikoura Earthquake, Kaikoura District Council was exempt from producing a Long Term Plan, and so has been excluded from all analysis.; 0

0528.00002; The I.R.S. has offered small insurance companies under tax avoidance scrutiny a way to avoid penalties through a new offer.; 0

0528.00004; The Internal Revenue Service is working to help to correct the tax avoidance and prevent it in the future. The small insurance companies are a specific group of taxpayers. They are taxpayers with captive insurance, which is designed to provide businesses with a way to insure themselves against risks that aren't typically included in standard coverage.; 0
0528.00005; Known as captives, these taxpayers have managed to create a tax avoidance incentive.; 0
0528.00006; The I.R.S. offer is meant to incentivise paying the taxes instead of avoiding them.; 0
0528.00007; It's possible for captives to be devised in a way that the associated risks would make it most likely that they would never need to make a claim.; 0
0528.00008; The premiums would then be returned to the business owners or their heirs either with low taxation or without paying any taxes. This type of strategy has become popular among owners of small insurers who view this type of coverage as a way to reduce their income and estates taxes without much risk of having to pay for claims. There have been many different versions of captives among the small insurance companies under scrutiny.; 0
0528.00009; For example, one New York Times report described one captive created by a dentist. That captive was designed to insure the dentist's office against terrorist attack.; 0
0528.00010; Another captive described by the same report was made by a jeweler in Phoenix to cover against radioactivity damage from a dirty bomb or from nuclear waste.; 0
0528.00011; Clearly, the risk associated with any of those events impacting those businesses is quite low. The type of deal the I.R.S. is offering to the small insurance companies is unique despite the fact that deals are regularly cut with taxpayers.; 0
0528.00012; What makes this one unique is that it targets business owners with a high net worth who have specifically created captive insurance companies for tax avoidance.

0531.00002; September 19, 2019  If you own a small limited company your shares entitle you to draw a return on your shareholding  -  in common parlance these returns are called dividends.; 0
0531.00003; A company can only pay dividends if it has current or accumulated tax-paid reserves.; 0
0531.00004; For most smaller companies this will be described as reserves or retained profits on your company balance sheet.; 0
0531.00005; As these reserves are made up of retained profits after corporation tax has been paid, if you take a dividend the underlying profits have already been taxed at 19%  -  the current corporation tax rate.; 1
0531.00006; Unfortunately, when you receive the dividend this is deemed to be taxable income and will be subject to further, hybrid rates of Income Tax. For the tax year 2019-20 the rates of dividend tax applied are:  The first £2,000 of dividends received are tax-free.; 0

For shareholders whose income, including dividends, falls into the higher or additional rate bands, the additional dividend tax payable can be significant. However, dividends are not subject to National Insurance and if you need to take funds from your company, withdrawing the bulk of your remuneration package as dividends can still be an attractive option.; 0

0533.00001; LEICESTER, United Kingdom  -  Since Brexit has dominated the UK news for the past three years, it might be easy to miss the great strides being made by the government in promoting religious freedom in the same time period. The latest move has been to appoint Rehman Chishti, a Conservative Member of Parliament, as the new Prime Minister's Special Envoy for Freedom of Religion or Belief.; 0
0533.00002; He replaces Lord Tariq Ahmad, the inaugural holder of the position. Ahmad was appointed to the post by then-Prime Minister Theresa May last year.; 0
0533.00003; The position is similar to the United States Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom, currently former Kansas governor and senator Sam Brownback.; 0
0533.00004; Ahmad launched the UK government's first ever program to find innovative solutions to promote and defend religious freedom, and also worked closely with the Holy See, the EU's Special Envoy for Promotion of Freedom of Religion, and the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief in developing the role. However, Ahmad had a pretty full plate.; 0
0533.00005; He was also the Prime Minister's Special Representative on Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict and Minister of State for the Commonwealth and the United Nations.; 0
0533.00006; Chishti's appointment means Britain will now have a dedicated person on the issue of religious freedom. The appointment also strengthens the position's institutional standing, since it will now have existed under two prime ministers.; 0
0533.00007; A special envoy is not a statutory position, and can be abolished by the prime minister  -  by contrast, the United States Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom is mandated by law.; 0
0533.00008; The appointment also came with assurances that the implementation of the recommendations from the recent independent review into the UK's support for persecuted Christians will continue, under Chishti's lead.; 0
0533.00009; The review, led by the Anglican Bishop of Truro, pointed out various reforms Britain's Foreign Office should take to better identify and combat the persecution of Christians around the world. This news was welcomed by religious freedom activists, who will always be nervous a new government won't prioritize the promises made by its predecessor.; 0
0533.00010; This is especially true with the present prime minister, Boris Johnson, who came into office in July with the singular purpose of completing the drawn-out divorce between the UK and the European Union.; 0
0533.00011; The previous Foreign Minister, Jeremy Hunt, had been a strong advocate for religious liberty, but he had also been the chief rival for the leadership of the Conservative Party after May announced her resignation. With Johnson's victory, Hunt was out of the cabinet, but his successor  -  Dominic Raab  -  has promised to continue his policies. A staggering 83 percent of the world's population live in nations where religious freedom is threatened or banned.; 0
0533.00012; It is an area where the UK can and must make a difference, Raab said when Chishti's appointment was announced.; 0
0533.00013; Like Ahmad, Chishti is a Muslim. Chishti is the son of an imam, and was born in Pakistan, arriving in the UK when he was only 6.; 0
0533.00014; When announced in his new position, Chishti said my family and I have always been able to openly and freely practice our faith. I want to ensure every citizen around the world is able to enjoy this basic right. Freedom of religion, practice and belief is one of the foundations of a free society, he said.; 0
0533.00015; Chishti was a leading champion for Asia Bibi, the Pakistani Christian mother who spent nearly a decade in prison facing a death sentence after being accused of insulting the Quran, and has often spoken out against Pakistan's draconian blasphemy laws.; 0
0533.00016; He called on the British government to offer her asylum after her eventual acquittal last year, and resigned as the Conservative vice-chair and trade envoy to Pakistan over the UK government's refusal to do so. Based upon his past advocacy, Chishti is expected to be a more muscular advocate for religious liberty than the often more diplomatic Ahmad.; 0
0533.00017; The Catholic Church welcomed his appointment, offering their support for the new envoy.; 0
0533.00018; Already, it is paying dividends: Earlier this year, the Catholic and Anglican churches offered a joint proposal calling for the Special Envoy for Freedom of Religion or Belief to be a dedicated position.; 0
0533.00019; The bishops must also have approved of a specific mention by the government that Chishti will advocate for the rights of all individuals here in the UK … who are being discriminated against and persecuted for their faith or belief. There have been accusations that the Foreign Office's emphasis on religious freedom wasn't being emulated, especially in the powerful Home Office, which handles security and immigration issues in the UK.; 0
0533.00020; The Home Office has drawn complaints from Christian leaders for rejecting asylum applications from Christian converts from the Middle East, who can face a death sentence for apostacy.; 0
0533.00021; The bishops have called on the government to take a joined-up approach involving not just foreign policy, but also security, trade, resettlement and asylum policy, rather than treating it as an isolated diplomatic activity.; 0
0533.00022; Catholic leaders have also suggested the UK government produce an annual report on religious persecution, similar to the one published by the U.S. State Department.; 0
0533.00023; However, the looming Oct. 31 Brexit deadline  -  and the expected resulting confusion and/or chaos  -  means church leaders might have to wait just a bit to get their full wish list. But they are certainly happy that with Chishti's appointment, a few more items have been checked off.; 0

0537.00001; By  AccountingWeekly  -  58  0  Facebook  Twitter  Google+  Pinterest  WhatsApp  Steinhoff International Holdings NV nominated Mazars as its new auditor as the South African retailer looks for a fresh start after an accounting scandal almost destroyed the company, says Bloomberg. Mazars accepted an offer to replace Deloitte, Steinhoff's board said at its annual general meeting in an Amsterdam hotel on Friday and shareholders will be able to vote on the proposal at a later date.; 0
0537.00002; Deloitte's refusal to sign off on Steinhoff's financials for the year through September 2017 ultimately brought to light a web of inflated asset values and dubious third-party transactions that caused the share price to collapse.; 0
0537.00003; However, it later emerged that the firm had signed off on audits from previous years that were similarly flawed, and Deloitte is being investigated by accounting regulators. Shareholders present at the meeting were quick to question how Steinhoff had come to select Mazars and whether its up to the task. While Deloitte has reviewed and restated earnings for 2017 and 2018 after months of work, little over 50% of investors voted to approve the results, with many abstaining.; 1
0537.00004; Among investors present at the meeting were representatives of VEB, the Dutch firm leading a class-action lawsuit against Steinhoff in the Netherlands.; 0
0537.00005; They urged Steinhoff's management, led by CEO Louis du Preez and chair Heather Sonn, to release the full version of a forensic report by PwC into the financial transactions behind the crisis.; 0
0537.00006; The executives reiterated that the results of the probe could not be released due to ongoing legal action against the company.; 0

0538.00001; You are here:  18 Sep, 2019 By Miles Rowland  HS2 will hold a pre-procurement industry day for phase 2a of the project on 8 October for works and design packages  The event comes despite the ongoing review of the project.; 0
0538.00002; It will be held to re-engage with the market and gather feedback about a new procurement approach. This would include appointing a design and delivery partner for a contract in the region of £300m-£500m, Construction News understands. The role of this partner would be to manage seven separate works packages on HS2's phase 2a, which would connect Birmingham with Crewe.; 1
0538.00003; The new strategy would allow it to put more emphasis on the design by bringing that within the contractor, according to an HS2 spokesman.; 0
0538.00004; He added: Because the packages are separate it allows us to stagger them a few years later. The value of the design and delivery contract would be roughly £300-£500m, though values for the seven works packages have not yet been established.; 0
0538.00005; According to the spokesman, the new procurement approach would build on lessons learned from the first phase of the project about the importance of putting time and effort into design and construction schedules and would allow the project to drive down costs later. Findings of the Oakervee-led review are not expected to be released before the end of October.; 0
0538.00006; HS2 chairman Allan Cook recently suggested that the project could not be completed within its £56bn budget and that a £72-£76bn range would be more realistic. A number of contractors signed a letter to the review panel last week warning that the cancellation of HS2 would drive up costs in the UK infrastructure market due to added risk premiums.; 0

0539.00005; It can't just sit on its hands and pretend that they need to do nothing further, she told reporters in Canberra on Wednesday. But Trade Minister Simon Birmingham stuck to the government's lines about global uncertainty and the coalition's personal income tax cuts and trade deals being enough.; 0
0539.00006; We can't control circumstances like Brexit, the US-China trade wars, or domestic issues in the US political environment, he told reporters in South Australia.; 0

0542.00002; After close to 100 candidate applications, Tunisia's presidential election on 15 September will feature 27 confirmed candidates, reflecting the country's fluid political situation and an ongoing split between traditional parties and alliances and enduring anti-establishment populism.; 1
0542.00003; The election has been moved up from its originally scheduled November date following the death of President Beji Caid Essebsi on 25 July.; 0
0542.00004; Since the 2011 revolution, the Tunisian political landscape has shifted significantly as electoral coalitions have been made and unmade, and as established political parties have fractured into smaller parties or collapsed amid leadership disagreements.; 0
0542.00005; In this context, presidential candidates reflect less party platforms and affiliation and more the ambitions of self-styled charismatic figures. The most recent published round of Arab Barometer surveys (2016) reveals diminishing trust in the political process and institutions.; 0
0542.00006; For example, 65% of Tunisians have low or no trust at all in the government, 57% have little or no trust in the legal system, and 72% have little or no trust in parliament. At the same time, the surveys show an increasing trust in security institutions: 69% of Tunisians have a great deal or quite a lot of trust in the police 93% of Tunisians have a great deal of trust in the army.; 0
0542.00007; These survey results  -  indicative but not conclusive  -  correlate with a massive rise in contentious politics.; 0
0542.00008; The Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights has recorded well over 10000 protests, strikes and other forms of collective and individual political action annually. Disillusionment among Tunisian citizens is marked most profoundly by social and economic grievances.; 0
0542.00009; These have translated into distrust of political institutions and notions that the new political establishment is not concerned with the very issues that drive citizens to take to the streets rather than to the polls. Unsurprisingly then, neither of the top two candidates in recent polls come from political parties currently represented in the legislature. The current front runner, despite accusations of tax evasion, is Nabil Karoui, an established business and media mogul.; 0
0542.00010; He is followed by an unaffiliated constitutional law expert, Kais Saied. Another rising candidate is the current minister of defence, Abdelkarim Zbidi.; 0
0542.00011; A former Ben Ali-era minister, Zbidi is credited with maintaining stability during Essebsi's final illness  -  a period that included two small-scale suicide bombings in the capital  -  and in the weeks that followed the president's death. While announcing his candidacy as an independent, he is backed by one of Tunisia's most dominant parties, Nidaa Tounes, which was unable to nominate its own candidate.; 0
0542.00012; Nidaa Tounes, established by the late Essebsi, previously held a majority in the national assembly until internal dissension resulted in party defections and the creation of splinter parties such as Tahya Tounes, led by current Prime Minister Youssef Chahed.; 0
0542.00013; Both Chahed and former prime minister Mehdi Jomaa are competing along liberal democratic lines by rooting their campaigns in technocratic expertise and political know-how.; 0
0542.00014; Tensions have also beset Ennahdha, the Muslim democratic party, which finally announced the current interim speaker of parliament, Abdelfattah Mourou, as its first ever presidential candidate.; 0
0542.00015; Ennahdha won Tunisia's first contested elections in 2011 and remained perhaps the most stable political player by creating coalitions across ideologies and harnessing strong local support.; 0
0542.00016; Other contenders include a prominent female candidate, Abir Moussi, who has gradually gained support because of her hardline anti-Islamist rhetoric and appeals to Tunisians nostalgic for the dictatorship of Ben Ali.; 0
0542.00017; On the left-leaning social democratic front are Mohamed Abbou and Moncef Marzouki.; 0
0542.00018; Abbou is the founder of the Attayar Party, which has made gains, especially in the centre and south of the country, among young Tunisians looking for a more radical alternative to the status quo based on political equality and just distribution of resources.; 0
0542.00019; Marzouki, who served as president following the 2011 revolution, is seeking to revive his political fortunes following his defeat to Essebsi in 2014.  The socioeconomic conditions in Tunisia are ripe for the rise of candidates and political entrepreneurs that represent, however distant from lived realities, a shift away from the status quo.; 0
0542.00020; This trend, while not influenced by the rise of the right-wing populism in the West, is certainly taking hold.; 0
0542.00021; This desire for anti-establishment politics is coupled with a heavy reliance on social media for news in Tunisia. By 2012, over 60 percent of Tunisians relied on Facebook rather than the traditional media for their daily news.; 1
0542.00022; Moreover, Essebsi's death has reignited fond remembrances of an earlier political era with Minister of Defence Zbidi riding this growing wave of nostalgia. In effect, the upcoming presidential and legislative campaigns will likely be defined by three political trends: (1) a version of politics-as-is, one shaped by the cross-ideological coalitions that have existed since 2011 as well as a strong showing by Ennahda (2) a reactionary political nostalgia shaped by a desire for competent technocracy, which is represented by the candidacy of the current minister of defence and the rise of younger liberal candidates and (3) the growing support for anti-establishment candidates that seek a real rupture with the modern political history of Tunisia.; 0
0542.00023; The biggest question hanging over these elections, however, is a large swing population composed of those Tunisians who have opted for street politics over electoral politics in recent years, as well as 1.5 million newly registered voters whose allegiances are up for grabs.; 0
0542.00024; In this context, a surprise win by anti-establishment forces would hardly represent coherent and widespread support for an alternative politics.; 0
0542.00025; It would instead represent the general political and economic hopelessness many Tunisians feel.; 0

0544.00001; The year 2016 witnessed the enactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code,  2016 a legislation which was much needed.; 0
0544.00002; The Code was passed mainly with the  view to consolidate and amend the existing legal framework of reorganization and  resolution of insolvent and bankrupt persons.; 0
0544.00003; It made it a point to improve on  the previous legislations dealing with insolvency and bankruptcy by including  characteristics of lesser time comparatively lesser loss during recoveries and  higher levels of financing. The first step in a corporate insolvency resolution process is to make all  possible efforts to revive and restart the corporate person[1].; 0
0544.00004; This is usually  done by preparing and enforcing a 'resolution plan'.; 0
0544.00005; However, if that does not  work out, the process that follows is liquidation .; 0
0544.00006; The Hon ble Supreme Court  in the matter of Swiss Ribbons Pvt.; 0
0544.00007; Ltd. & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors.[2],  observed: What is interesting to note is that the Preamble does not, in any manner, refer  to liquidation, which is only availed of as a last resort if there is either no  resolution plan or the resolution plans submitted are not up to the mark.; 0
0544.00008; Even  in liquidation, the liquidator can sell the business of the corporate debtor as  a going concern . When is an order for Liquidation passed by the Adjudicating Authority?; 0
0544.00009; Following are the situations where an order for liquidation is passed by the  Adjudicating Authority: (a)   When a Resolution plan  which is required under Section 30(6) of  Insolvency Code, 2016 is not received before the expiry of the insolvency  resolution process period or the maximum period permitted for completion of the  corporate insolvency resolution process under section 12 of Insolvency Code,  2016 or the fast track corporate insolvency resolution process under section 56 of  Insolvency Code, 2016, as the case may be (section 33(1)(a) of Insolvency Code,  2016) (b) When the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) rejects the resolution plan submitted  to it under section 31 for the non-compliance of the requirements specified. (c) Where before the approval of a resolution plan, the resolution professional  intimates to the NCLT the decision of Committee of Creditors (CoC) approved by  not less than sixty-six per cent of the voting share to liquidate the corporate  debtor. (d) Where a resolution plan approved by the Adjudicating Authority is  contravened by the corporate debtor, any person other than the corporate debtor,  whose interests are prejudicially affected by such contravention, may make an  application to the Adjudicating Authority for a liquidation order.; 0
0544.00010; If the  adjudicating authority determines that the corporate debtor has indeed  contravened the resolution plan, it shall pass a liquidation order.; 0
0544.00011; In Innoventive Industries v. ICICI Bank Ltd[3], it was held that from the date  of an order for liquidation of corporate debtor under Section 33, the moratorium  shall cease to have effect.; 0
0544.00012; Appointment of A Liquidator After the adjudicating authority passes an order for liquidation under section  33 of Insolvency Code, the resolution professional who was appointed for the  corporate insolvency resolution process shall, subject to submission of a  written consent by the resolution professional to the Adjudicatory Authority in  a specified form, act as the liquidator for the purposes of liquidation, unless  replaced by the Adjudicating Authority under section 34(4) of the Code. Eligibility ·         An Insolvency Professional shall be eligible to be appointed as a  liquidator only if he/she and every partner or director of the insolvency  professional entity of which he/she is a part of, is independent of the  corporate debtor.; 0
0544.00013; ·         In addition to this, he/she should be eligible to be appointed as  independent director of corporate debtor under section 149 of Companies Act,  2013. ·         He/She should not have been an employee or proprietor or partner of  auditors, secretarial auditors or cost auditors of corporate debtor in last  three financial years or legal or consulting firm of corporate debtor  contributing to more than 10% of gross turnover of such firm in last three  financial years.[Regulation 3(1) of IBBI (Liquidation Process) Regulations,  2016] ·         It is important for the person who is supposed to be appointed as a  liquidator to disclose any pecuniary or personal relationship with the corporate  debtor.; 0
0544.00014; It is also pertinent to note that he/she should not represent any other  stakeholder in the same liquidation process. There might be instances where the person acting as the Resolution Professional  is not appointed as the liquidator.; 0
0544.00015; This is usually done where:- ·         the resolution plan submitted by the resolution professional under  section 30 was rejected for failure to meet the requirements mentioned in  section 30(2) of section 30 or ·          the IBBI recommends the replacement of a resolution professional to  the Adjudicating Authority for reasons to be recorded in writing, or · the resolution professional fails to submit written consent under  section 34(1)  -  section 34(4) of Insolvency Code, 2016 In Sahara Fincon v. Tirupati Ceramics[4], it was held that replacement of a  Resolution Professional as a liquidator can be only as per provisions of section  34(4) of the Code[5].; 0
0544.00016; In this case, the Committee of Creditors had resolved to  replace RP even before rejection of resolution plan to be submitted by the RP.; 0
0544.00017; Section 34(2) of the Code states that on the appointment of a liquidator, all  powers of the board of directors, key managerial personnel and the partners of  the corporate debtor, as the case may be, shall cease to have effect and shall  be vested in the liquidator.; 0
0544.00018; Soon after the appointment of a liquidator, there is a public announcement of  the same in the local newspaper, website of the corporate debtor and website of  IBBI.; 0
0544.00019; The public announcement calls upon stakeholders to submit their claims  within 30 days from liquidation commencement date Liquidation commencement  date basically means the date on which the proceedings for liquidation commence  in accordance with section 33 or section 59 of the Code as the case may be.; 0
0544.00020; Duties of A Liquidator Some of the main duties of a liquidator are[6]:- ·         to verify claims of all the creditors ·         to take into his custody or control all the assets, property, effects  and actionable claims of the corporate debtor ·         to evaluate the assets and property of the corporate debtor in the  manner as may be specified by the Board and prepare a report ·         to take such measures to protect and preserve the assets and  properties of the corporate debtor as he considers necessary ·          to carry on the business of the corporate debtor for its beneficial  liquidation as he considers necessary ·         to invite and settle claims of creditors and claimants and distribute  proceeds in accordance with the provisions of this Code ·         to perform such other functions as may be specified by the Board.; 0
0544.00021; For the purposes of liquidation, the liquidator shall form an estate of the  assets which will be called the liquidation estate in relation to the corporate  debtor[7].; 0
0544.00022; The liquidator shall hold the liquidation estate as a fiduciary for  the benefit of all the creditors.; 0
0544.00023; Section 38 of the Code provides that the  liquidator shall receive or collect the claims of creditors within a period of  thirty days from the date of the commencement of the liquidation process and a  creditor may withdraw or vary his claim under this section within fourteen days  of its submission. Thereafter, the liquidator shall verify the claims submitted  within such time period as may be prescribed by the IBBI. Section 40 of the Code  provides that the liquidator may, after verification of claims under Section 39,  either admit or reject the claim, in whole or in part, as the case may be.; 0
0544.00024; It is  further provided that where the liquidator rejects a claim, he shall record in  writing the reasons for such rejection. It is mandatory for the liquidator to  communicate his decision of admission or rejection of claims to the creditor and  corporate debtor within seven days of such admission or rejection of claims.; 0
0544.00025; The Hon ble NCLAT, in the matter of S. C. Sekaran v. Amit Gupta & Ors., directed as  under: We direct the Liquidator to proceed in accordance with law.; 0
0544.00026; He will verify  claims of all the creditors take into custody and control of all the assets,  property, effects and actionable claims of the corporate debtor ,  carry on the business of the  corporate debtor  for its beneficial  liquidation etc. as prescribed under Section 35 of the I&B Code List of Stakeholders The liquidator prepares a list of stakeholders, category-wise, on the basis of  proofs of claims submitted and accepted[8] with- ·         the amounts of claim admitted, if applicable, ·         the extent to which the debts or dues are secured or unsecured, if  applicable, ·         the details of the stakeholders, and ·          the proofs admitted or rejected in part, and the proofs wholly  rejected.; 0
0544.00027; The liquidator then files the list of stakeholders with the Adjudicating  Authority within forty-five days from the last date for receipt of claims.; 0
0544.00028; The  filing of the list shall be announced to the public in the manner specified. The  list of stakeholders, as modified from time to time, shall be- ·         available for inspection by the persons who submitted proofs of claim ·         available for inspection by members, partners, directors and  guarantors of the corporate debtor ·         displayed on the website, if any, of the corporate debtor.; 0
0544.00029; Asset Memorandum Upon forming the liquidation estate under section 36 of the Code, the liquidator  shall prepare an asset memorandum in accordance with the Liquidation Regulations  within seventy-five days from the liquidation commencement date[9].; 0
0544.00030; The asset  memorandum shall provide the following details in respect of the assets which  are intended to be realized by way of sale- ·         value of the asset, valued in accordance with Regulation 35 of  Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (liquidation process) Regulations,  2016. ·         value of the assets or business(s) under clauses (b) to (f) of  regulation 32, valued in accordance with regulation 35, if intended to be sold  under those clauses ·         intended manner of sale in accordance with Regulation 32, and reasons  for the same ·         the intended mode of sale and reasons for the same in accordance with  Regulation 33 ·         expected amount of realization from sale and ·         any other information that may be relevant for the sale of the asset The liquidator shall file the asset memorandum along with the preliminary report  to the Adjudicating Authority. The asset memorandum shall not be accessible to  any person during the course of liquidation, unless permitted by the  Adjudicating Authority. Priority of Distribution Section 53 of the Code has established an ordered of priority among creditors,  which will determine the sequence in which outstanding debts will be repaid.; 0
0544.00031; This is:- 1. IRP and liquidation costs 2. Workmen s dues (for 24 months), and secured dues, if the security has been  relinquished 3. Employees  dues (for 12 months) 4.; 0
0544.00032; Unsecured financial creditors 5. Government dues, and unpaid dues to secured creditor, if the security has been  realized 6.; 0
0544.00033; Remaining debts and dues (which include, unsecured operational debts) 7. Preference shareholders 8.; 0
0544.00034; Equity shareholders. Once the creditors committee chooses to liquidate the company s assets, there  are two paths available to the secured creditor  -  they may choose to opt out of  the resolution process and enforce their security to recover debts owed to them  or they may participate in the resolution process, thereby giving up all rights  over the collateral. The latter option will prioritise the secured creditor  ahead of all except the dues owed to workmen.; 0
0544.00035; Another unique feature of the Code  is the low priority accorded to government dues, unlike the Companies Act, 2013  where they are paid alongside employees and unsecured financial creditors.; 0
0544.00036; Now,  they are paid after secured creditors, unsecured creditors, employees, and  workmen.; 0
0544.00037; This undoubtedly signals the business-first principle that is guiding  the Code, where the government is viewed only as a facilitator and regulator,  and not an active participant in the affairs of commercial entities. This is a  positive step, as government agencies have unrivalled resources at their  disposal to collect their dues, and do not need to burden the insolvency  resolution process, especially in its early stages.; 0
0544.00038; Distribution of Assets Subject to the provisions of section 53, the liquidator shall not commence  distribution before the list of stakeholders and the asset memorandum has been  filed with the Adjudicating Authority. The liquidator shall distribute the  proceeds from realization within ninety days from the receipt of the amount to  the stakeholders. The insolvency resolution process costs, if any, and the  liquidation costs shall be deducted before such distribution is made.; 0
0544.00039; Unclaimed Proceeds of Liquidation Or Undistributed Assets Regulation 46[10] states that before the order of dissolution is passed under  section 54(2), the liquidator shall apply to the Adjudicating Authority for an  order to pay into the Companies Liquidation Account in the Public Account of  India any unclaimed proceeds of liquidation or undistributed assets or any other  balance payable to the stakeholders in his hands on the date of the order of  dissolution.; 0
0544.00040; It is further provided that any liquidator who retains any money  which should have been paid by him into the Companies Liquidation Account under  this Regulation shall pay interest on the amount retained at the rate of twelve  per cent per annum, and also pay such penalty as may be determined by the Board.; 0
0544.00041; A person claiming to be entitled to any money paid into the Companies  Liquidation Account may apply to the Board for an order for payment of the money  claimed which may, if satisfied that such person is entitled to the whole or  any part of the money claimed, make an order for the payment to that person of  the sum due to him, after taking such security from him as it may think fit.; 0
0544.00042; Conclusion The Supreme Court, NCLTs and NCLATS have time and again reiterated that  The  first order objective is resolution .; 0
0544.00043; The second order objective is maximisation of value of assets of the  Corporate Debtor and the third order  objective is  promoting entrepreneurship, availability of credit and balancing  the interests .; 0
0544.00044; This order of objective is sacrosanct. In Swiss Ribbons Case the  Supreme Court observed: What is interesting to note is that the Preamble does not, in any manner, refer  to liquidation, which is only availed of as a last resort if there is either no  resolution plan or the resolution plans submitted are not up to the mark. Even  in liquidation, the liquidator can sell the business of the corporate debtor as  a going concern .; 0
0544.00045; It can thus be seen that the primary focus of the legislation  is to ensure revival and continuation of the corporate debtor by protecting the  corporate debtor from its own management and from a corporate death by  liquidation. Liquidation should be availed only as the last resort and every  effort should be made to revive the corporate entity.; 0

0545.00001; Thomas Cook store shuts even before today's last ditch talks to save travel firm By Mike Laycock Chief reporter  The Thomas Cook store in Nessgate, which has closed down  THOMAS Cook's store in York city centre has closed down - even before last ditch talks were held today to try to avert the collapse of the tour operator.; 0
0545.00002; The branch in Nessgate lies empty and locked today, even though it was not in a list of 21 stores nationwide which the firm announced in the spring were set to close as part of an ongoing programme to drive greater efficiencies. None of the company's three York branches - in Nessgate, Monks Cross and Clifton Moor- were included in the list. It is understood the Nessgate store shut down earlier this month but the Monks Cross and Clifton Moor branches will be opening as normal today.; 0
0545.00003; The tour operator is holding talks with key players this morning in a final bid to piece together a rescue deal.; 0
0545.00004; The move comes as holidaymakers at a hotel in Tunisia report being locked in by security guards as the hotel demands extra money in fear it won't be paid by Thomas Cook. Today's crisis meeting, first reported by Sky News, is understood to be taking place at City law firm Slaughter & May. Among those attending will be the firm's biggest shareholder along with creditors.; 0
0545.00005; The travel company is at risk of falling into administration within days unless it finds £200 million in extra funds.; 0
0545.00006; A collapse would leave up to 150,000 UK holidaymakers stranded and the Government is being urged to step in to help save the business.; 1
0545.00007; Thomas Cook continued to reassure worried customers last night that their flights continue to operate as normal and all their package holidays are ATOL-protected.; 0
0545.00008; However, tourists at the Les Orangers beach resort in the town of Hammamet, near Tunis, say their hotel is refusing to let guests leave while demanding extra money.; 0
0545.00009; Ryan Farmer, from Leicestershire, told BBC Radio Five's Stephen Nolan show the hotel had on Saturday afternoon summoned all guests who were due to leave to go to reception to pay additional fees, obviously because of the situation with Thomas Cook.; 0
0545.00010; With many tourists refusing pay on the grounds they had already paid Thomas Cook, security guards were keeping the hotel's gates shut, refusing to allow guests out, or to let new visitors enter.; 0
0545.00011; We can't leave the hotel.; 0
0545.00012; I'd describe it as exactly the same as being held hostage, Mr Farmer said. The Transport Salaried Staffs Association, which represents workers at the company, said the Government should be ready to assist with real financial support.; 0
0545.00013; General Secretary Manuel Cortes called for an urgent meeting with Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom.; 0
0545.00014; He said in a letter: It is incumbent upon the Government to act if required and save this iconic cornerstone of the British high street and the thousands of jobs that go with it. Thomas Cook can be a highly successful business and must be given every opportunity to flourish. I urge you to stand ready to assist Thomas Cook with real financial support.; 0
0545.00015; The company must be rescued no matter what.; 0
0545.00016; No British government in its right mind would countenance the loss of so many jobs and the prospect of just one major travel operator - TUI - controlling the mass market. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said: This is yet more evidence of this Government's indifference to British jobs and businesses going under. All viable options must be explored by Thomas Cook and the Government must consider stepping in and taking an equity stake to avoid this crisis.; 0
0545.00017; Refusing to do so is ideological shortsightedness: the Government faces a simple choice between a £200 million Government cash injection to save the company now versus a £600 million bill to repatriate UK holidaymakers.; 1
0545.00018; It is understood that Thomas Cook has approached the Government in an attempt to plug a gap in its funding.; 0

0549.00002; The University's appropriation request still requires the approval of the full board during its meeting on Sept. 13. Each year, Penn State's appropriation directly benefits approximately 53,000 Pennsylvania resident students and their families who receive an in-state tuition rate. State support also aids Penn State Agricultural Research and Extension operations that have a profound impact on one of the commonwealth's critical industries, and provides important funding for Pennsylvania College of Technology and Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, in support of Penn State's land-grant mission to benefit the citizens of Pennsylvania.; 0
0549.00003; This year's appropriation request includes $2.35 million for economic development initiatives, which would allow the Invent Penn State initiative to strengthen and grow its network of innovation hubs, or LaunchBoxes, across the commonwealth.; 0
0549.00004; To date, Invent Penn State has created 21 innovation hubs in Commonwealth Campus communities statewide, supporting nearly 2,500 early-stage startup businesses.; 1
0549.00005; If provided, the additional funding would enable Penn State to expand its entrepreneurship programming and pilot four new innovation hubs in underserved areas of the state. These centers offer co-working space, business accelerator programs, legal and intellectual property advice, and rapid prototyping resources  -  all free to the community  -  to drive innovation and economic growth.; 0

0549.00010; Penn State's 2020-21 appropriation request includes:  $256.6 million for the University's general support appropriation, an increase of 6%, or $14.5 million, over 2019-20  -  funding that helps to defray the cost of a Penn State education for Pennsylvania resident students. $58.3 million for Agricultural Research and Extension, an increase of 6%, or $3.3 million.; 0
0549.00011; These programs serve citizens and the agricultural industry in all 67 Pennsylvania counties. Because these activities are not supplemented with tuition, appropriation increases are necessary to keep pace with the rising cost of providing critical research and support for Pennsylvania agriculture. $28.3 million for Pennsylvania College of Technology in Williamsport, an increase of 6%, or $1.6 million.; 0
0549.00012; Penn College is a wholly owned subsidiary of Penn State with a focus on applied technology education in high-demand fields, including nursing and health sciences construction and industrial, computing and engineering technologies.; 0

0554.00001; by Tyler Durden  Sat, 09/14/2019 - 07:35  0  SHARES  A new study published by the International Monetary Fund has found that $15 trillion of the world's foreign direct investments are phantom capital - a term used to describe capital that is designed to minimize tax bills of multinational firms. This total makes up 40% of the world's foreign direct investments, and is the equivalent to the combined GDP of China and Germany, according to Bloomberg. These types of investments have risen about 10% over the past decade despite global efforts to curb tax avoidance, according to the IMF study.; 1
0554.00002; The capital makes its way through corporate shells that generally have no operations or real business activity. The study stated:  FDI (foreign direct investment) is often an important driver for genuine international economic integration, stimulating growth and job creation and boosting productivity. But phantom capital is financial and tax engineering that blurs traditional FDI statistics and makes it difficult to understand genuine economic integration.; 0
0554.00003; It continued:  Luxembourg, a country of 600,000 people, hosts as much FDI as the U.S. and much more than China. Unsurprisingly, an economy's exposure to phantom FDI increases with the corporate tax rate.; 0
0554.00004; About half of the world's phantom capital is hosted by Luxembourg and the Netherlands, with just 10 economies globally holding more than 85% of such investments.; 0
0554.00005; The study concluded that international cooperation was vital to solving the issue: Indeed, this year the IMF put forward various alternatives for a revised international tax architecture, ranging from minimum taxes to allocation of taxing rights to destination economies. No matter which road policymakers choose, one fact remains clear: international cooperation is the key to dealing with taxation in today's globalized economic environment.; 0

0555.00001; Here at Consonance we send ONIX to around thirty recipients, and I think it's fair to say that no two feeds are exactly the same  -  different content goes to each client even for the same product at the same time.; 0
0555.00002; This may be a surprise, since ONIX is a capital-S Standard in the book trade, or, more accurately, it is a set of standards that cover various different functionalities and versions.; 0
0555.00003; However, here we're concerned with one form  -  ONIX for Books  -  for the exchange of product metadata.; 0
0555.00004; But given that ONIX for Books is a Standard, why would a single product not have a single version at any one time, to be sent to all recipients?; 0
0555.00005; Isn't that the point of a Standard?; 0
0555.00006; If only it were so … and for the following reasons, it is not.; 0
0555.00007; What follows is a list of some of the features that ONIX recipients ask us for.; 0
0555.00008; 1. Proprietary Codes, Please Identification is a perpetual bugbear of the publishing industry. The ISBN is thankfully well-established as a product identifier, but as far as the rest goes it's still the Wild West out there.; 0
0555.00009; ISTCs appear to be dead or dying as a work identifier DOI is well-established in the academic market and ISNI has a strong and growing claim as an authoritative identifier of public personae (authors, primarily). Outside of the English-speaking world there are pockets of strongly-established identifiers for publishers (e.g. the Fondscode Boekenbank) and imprints (e.g. Identifiant Marque Electre in France), and the ISNI can be used for such purposes.; 0
0555.00010; But in the global publishing market there are few, maybe no, widely-used organisational identifiers.; 0
0555.00011; And therefore we have ONIX recipients, primarily distributors, who must have their code for an imprint in the ONIX feed, with specific requirements on how it should be included in the feed.; 0
0555.00012; Well, if they're big enough then they can get away with it, but in practice I suspect that they have lumbered themselves with a requirement that is so infrequently fulfilled by ONIX vendors that their ONIX take-up by smaller publishers will be very poor.; 0
0555.00013; I have heard, anecdotally, of a medium-sized publisher being quoted in excess of £10,000 for the establishment of an ONIX feed to a major UK distributor, an offer which the publisher declined in favour of continuing to type metadata into a web form.; 1
0555.00014; It probably goes without saying that if you start sending distributors imprint-specific codes to all of your ONIX recipients, you're soon going to find problems. Thus we have  Rule One:  For some ONIX recipients you must include their particular identification codes, and you'd best not be sending them to anyone else.; 0
0555.00015; We Still Use The Old Way ONIX is a standard, but it is an evolving standard, and particularly in the still-alive-and-kicking ONIX 2.1 there are almost always different ways of representing the same data.; 0
0555.00016; ISBN-13 could be represented in its own element, or as a type 15 Product Identifier, or even as a type 03 (GTIN-13) Product Identifier.; 0
0555.00017; Rule Two:  For every new way of representing a data item in ONIX, there will be one new format of ONIX required by someone.; 0
0555.00018; We're Eight Code Lists Behind Another way in which ONIX evolves is by the addition of new code values, and re-interpretations of old values.; 0
0555.00019; The Price Qualifier 06 used to be Corporate price, described as Price for sale to libraries or other corporate or institutional customers. The use of or is a giveaway, because now, of course, 06 is Corporate / Library / Education price, and there are more specific codes (six of them) to allow differentiation between the subtypes.; 0
0555.00020; None of which will stop some recipients of library prices from requiring that they be coded as 05.; 0
0555.00021; Rule Three:  The same data is sometimes sent under different codes.; 0
0555.00022; We Don't Need That ONIX is a broad format, and it covers many business cases for transferring metadata: publisher to distributor, publisher to sales agent, publisher to retailer, and so on. For some of these you need to include particular data that is not required for others:  Retailers need to know the consumer prices, not the library prices.; 0
0555.00023; They might need only particular currencies, and if they only price in a single currency then telling them which territories that price applies in is unnecessary.; 0
0555.00024; Sales agents already know who the sales agents are (it's them), but might need to know the full range of prices  -  consumer/library, GBP/USD/AUD  -  and in which territories each currency should be used.; 0
0555.00025; Metadata aggregators quite often don't need to know who all your distributors are, but if they're broadcasting metadata round the world then the list of sales agents per territory is going to be useful. It is not necessarily a case that sending the extra data is going to break anything (see Rule Seven for that), but every extra data item you send is another potential data change that you have to check for, which might cause data to be sent too frequently to recipients.; 0
0555.00026; If you change your sales agent for Algeria, do you then want to send a complete refresh for every product with world sales rights to every recipient?; 0
0555.00027; Rule Four:  Not every recipient needs every item of data. Be prepared to trim off the excess. ONIX Doesn't Do What We Need ONIX is also a narrow format.; 0
0555.00028; There is a wide range of metadata that it is not designed to carry, but the standard can be bent slightly to accommodate extra requirements. One example of this is the identification of POD printers to a distributor.; 0
0555.00029; A POD arrangement might be in place with different printers in different territories, or a stock item in some territories and POD in other.; 0
0555.00030; It might be true POD, or could be an automatic stock replenishment program designed to keep a minimum number of units in stock.; 0
0555.00031; This can require logic such as when sending this product to this recipient, against this supplier add one or more codes to represent this set of POD/ASR arrangements. Rule Five:  Sometimes you will need to go beyond the natural capabilities of ONIX.  6.; 0
0555.00032; Not In That Order We can read those codes, but only the first six, so please make sure that they are ordered according to the following arrangement. Typically observed with Related Product composites, and reflecting a weakness in the capabilities of the recipient's system, we sometimes cannot rely on sending all the metadata and letting the recipient pick out the interesting parts.; 0
0555.00033; Rule Six:  It's not just the data, it's the order in which you include it.; 0
0555.00034; That Breaks Our System Just because ONIX is valid doesn't mean it's valid for everyone. Particularly seen in composites that can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, some systems will only accept particular codes for those composites.; 0
0555.00035; Add the wrong one, and that's your data not ingested.; 0
0555.00036; Often expressed as We can only accept one Work Identifier.; 0
0555.00037; Rule Seven:  One person's valid ONIX is another person's we can't read this.; 0
0555.00038; Different Market, Different Data I think it is fair to say that publishers in the UK have a particular perspective on prices.; 0
0555.00039; No tax on print books.; 0
0555.00040; One rate of tax on eBooks.; 0
0555.00041; No need to think about tax for the rest of the world. And the slight variation in there is that academic publishers often want to specify eBook prices exc-tax, and trade publishers want to specify inc-tax.; 0
0555.00042; UK recipients of GBP pricing generally want inc-tax prices, and for the most part this is entirely compatible with the publisher's viewpoint.; 0
0555.00043; In Europe there appears to be a slightly different approach, in that specifying inc-tax prices in their home currency means picking their own VAT rate and applying it to their Euro prices.; 0
0555.00044; When the price is sent to a trade partner in a different country who also uses Euros, there are a few possibilities:  Use the same inc-VAT price, but with local taxes applied instead. Use the same exc-VAT price, converted to new inc-VAT prices at the local tax rates.; 0
0555.00045; Rule Eight:  The same data item can need to be presented in an entirely different way. Send Different Data Consider the Short Description  -  350 characters of finely tuned, carefully crafted marketing wizardry, designed to entice the reader.; 0
0555.00046; Do you want to send the same text to Amazon.com as you do to Waterstones?; 0
0555.00047; Possibly not. Rule Nine:  Not everything can be blamed on ONIX recipients.; 0
0555.00048; Sometimes you just have to do what you have to do. Send Different Products eBook distributors get PDFs, only send Kindle to Amazon, don't send this to them unless it has a USD consumer price, OpenAccess doesn't go there…  You get the picture.; 0
0555.00049; Rule Ten:  You sometimes need to filter out products by varied criteria. There is no such thing as Standard, and sometimes you have to:  Not send some data.; 0
0555.00050; Change the order of the data.; 0
0555.00051; Change the meaning of some data.; 0
0555.00052; Add extra not-strictly-ONIX data. Add particular identifiers unique to a recipient.; 0
0555.00053; Next up, I'll write about how we track changes to product-level ONIX on a per-recipient basis, to guarantee that they only get truly incremental feeds.; 0

0556.00001; What happens to the employees of Thomas Cook?; 0
0556.00002; Chartered Accountant / IT Recruitment Company Director 0 0  0  Thomas Cook is all over the news today, after its collapse into administration this morning (at 2am).; 0
0556.00003; Here's the statement: Thomas Cook UK Plc and associated UK entities have entered Compulsory Liquidation and are now under the control of the Official Receiver. It's important to note that a Compulsory Liquidation means that the situation is terminal, unlike Company Administration, which is intended to give space and time for potential business rescue and recovery so that the company can avoid insolvency. This will be distressing and inconvenient for travellers (600,000 worldwide, of whom 150,000 are British citizens, including at least one close friend of mine) but they'll get home eventually and carry on with their lives as before.; 1
0556.00004; It's worse for the town of Peterborough, and for the many hotels, shops and restaurants abroad that rely on the travel company for their business.; 0
0556.00005; But it's a hammer blow for the employees of Thomas Cook and their families, and I feel very bad for them.; 0
0556.00006; So  -  if you're an employee  -  what happens next? Thomas Cook will make some employees redundant, and will ask others to keep working.; 0
0556.00007; There is still a huge repatriation exercise to complete, and the company will need to be managed through the winding-up procedure. Employees affected by a company entering liquidation can still legally claim for any of the following if they are owed it:  Any wages that have gone unpaid Payment in lieu of any notice period Holiday pay Redundancy pay.; 0
0556.00008; Compensation for the above claims (for residents of England, Scotland and Wales) is handled by the Insolvency Service. It will be the responsibility of the appointed liquidator to inform employees of their rights and send the appropriate forms giving advice on what allowances they can claim. There is a cap on redundancy payments, set at £525 a week for each element of the claim (arrears of pay, holiday pay, redundancy etc).; 1
0556.00009; What happens if you're a contractor? If you're working at Thomas Cook on a temporary basis, you should check your contract as soon as you can. For reference, here's the order in which creditors get paid when a company becomes insolvent:  Liquidator's fees Secured creditors with a fixed charge (e.g. banks with security in the form of a mortgage over premises, land etc, factoring companies).; 0
0556.00010; Preferential creditors - including employees who are owed arrears of wages and holiday pay up to certain limits, and outstanding pension contributions.; 0
0556.00011; Secured floating charge creditors Unsecured creditors  -  i.e. trade suppliers, contractors, HMRC, suppliers, and customers.; 0
0556.00012; Connected unsecured creditors  -  e.g. members of a director's family, or staff members who have loaned money to the company on an unsecured basis.; 0
0556.00013; Finally  -  shareholders. If you're directly employed by an agency (i.e. on a 'contract of service'), the relevant contract is the one between you and them. Same if you're working via an umbrella company.; 0
0556.00014; If you have your own limited company and you're working on a contract via a recruitment business, you should check the terms you've agreed.; 0
0556.00015; Most contracts will terminate immediately because of the insolvency of the end client, and you should get paid for the work you've already done. But in some cases (if you've opted out of the Agency Regulations) you might have a contract clause that allows the agency to withhold payment to you pending payment by the client. In this case they (and you) will be some way down the list, so payment in full is nowhere near guaranteed, and insolvencies can take a long time to complete.; 0
0556.00016; This also applies if you're a direct contractor and not an employee (i.e. a supplier).; 0
0556.00017; The recruitment company itself may also be at risk, if Thomas Cook was a key client of theirs.; 0
0556.00018; Note: we factor our contractor debts, and are covered by insurance in case the end client goes under  -  which has happened once.; 0
0556.00019; Our contractors were paid on time and our fees (minus our excess) were recovered. We don't have a 'pay when paid' clause in any of our contracts.; 0
0556.00020; Next steps  If you're an employee you should hear from the liquidator, if you haven't already. If you're a contractor, check your contract to see where you stand.; 0
0556.00021; If you're being kept on, do the best job you can. Anecdotally, many Thomas Cook employees are continuing to do a very good job in the face of immense pressure and job uncertainty.; 0
0556.00022; Look for alternative work.; 0
0556.00023; Your experience may be in the travel industry, but don't let that restrict you. Focus on your transferable skills, and take advice from a reputable recruitment company if you need to.; 0
0556.00024; Opportunities for work do exist, but it will be very challenging for some.; 0
0556.00025; I see that TUI are holding a recruitment fair at their Luton Office. Finally, good luck.; 0

0557.00001; Published Wed, Sep 18 2019 2:16 PM EDT The Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Wednesday, the second time this year.; 0
0557.00002; But before you rush out to open a CD before rates fall, experts say you may want to consider all your savings options.; 0
0557.00003; The central bank cut its benchmark short-term interest rate by a quarter of a point , from 2% to 1.75%. The Fed said in a statement that it would continue to monitor the economic outlook and act as appropriate to keep the U.S. economy growing.; 0
0557.00004; But just because the Fed cut rates again doesn't mean that using CDs will automatically earn you a higher rate.; 0
0557.00005; In fact, Wealthfront CEO Andy Rachleff sees  serious reasons to take pause before moving your savings into a CD. It might seem like a great idea to put your emergency fund in an account that earns a higher rate, but if that rate comes with the stipulation that the funds are locked up for a set period of time, that money is not of much value if the emergency for which you saved occurs in the interim, Rachleff says. Of course, the Wealthfront executive isn't totally unbiased, since his company does offer a cash account with a high APY.; 0
0557.00006; But it is true: There are other options available that pay roughly the same interest as a CD and don't require you to lock up your money.; 0
0557.00007; You can get the same return in a high-yield savings account or a money market account without having to lock your cash up for a period of time, Eric Roberge , a certified financial planner and founder of Beyond Your Hammock, tells CNBC Make It . Sallie Mae currently offers one of the highest interest rates on a one-year CD available, according to Nerdwallet's review  -  2.45% APY for deposits of at least $2,500.; 0
0557.00008; Don't have that kind of cash lying around? Barclay's currently offers 2.40% APY on 12-month CDs without requiring a minimum deposit.; 0
0557.00009; But top high-yield savings accounts pay well too, and you can access your money right when you need it.; 0
0557.00010; If you prefer a high-yield savings account, Vio Bank has an option that pays 2.52% on all balances , with a minimum of $100 required to open.; 1
0557.00011; Popular Bank's Plus Savings account , meanwhile, pays 2.50% APY on balances over $5,000.; 0
0557.00012; Even digital wealth management companies Betterment and Wealthfront offer cash accounts with very competitive APYs of up to 2.44% and 2.32%, respectively, along with no fees, unlimited transfers, and FDIC insurance covering up to $1 million.; 0
0557.00013; That said, Roberge notes that for many Americans, the hassle of trying to chase the best interest rates may not yield the biggest windfalls.; 0
0557.00014; The good news here is that you are less likely to make a downright poor financial decision in trying to find the absolute highest rate on a savings account, he says. But you will probably create a lot of work for yourself and make yourself crazy by trying to switch savings accounts every time someone comes out with an offer that is 0.01% better than what you currently have, Roberge adds.; 0
0557.00015; Yet it's still important to have high-yield savings, something most people aren't using. Just 14% of Americans have a savings account that pays more than 2% APY, according to a Bankrate survey.; 0
0557.00016; Let's say you have $1,000 in your savings account at a brick-and-mortar bank earning the average interest. After five years, you'd earn about $14.; 1
0557.00017; But if you save your money in an online savings account that earned just 2% APY, you'd have $104 at the end of five years.; 1
0557.00018; And the bigger your balance, the more it adds up.; 0

0558.00007; Others said they were keen to hear more rather than dismissing the deal immediately in favour of the Refinitiv tie-up.; 0
0558.00008; We would expect there to be some synergy (in the HKEX deal) both in terms of corporate overheads and technology, said James Bevan, chief investment officer at CCLA. He added that while he was broadly supportive of the Refinitiv deal, he had some concerns about the data firm's growth strategy.; 0
0558.00009; HKEX has until Oct. 9 to make a firm offer or walk away. HKEX declined to comment on the deal beyond its statement on Friday that it would continue to engage with LSE shareholders and that its offer was in their best interests. LSE did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday.; 0

If a £200m hole in its finances is not plugged, Thomas Cook could collapse as early as this weekend, Sky News reported.; 0

0559.00006; In a stock exchange announcement on Friday, the company said it was in talks with its banks, bondholders and biggest shareholder.; 0
0559.00007; The £200m would be designed to see it through the winter on top of a £900m rescue deal that was close to being finalised. Discussions include a recent request for a seasonal standby facility of £200m, on top of the previously announced £900m injection of new capital, Thomas Cook said.; 0

The company is in talks with China's Fosun International, its biggest shareholder, which had already agreed to supply £450m in return for a majority stake in Thomas Cook's tour-operating business and a stake in its airline.; 0

0564.00001; Do you want your piece of the pie or do you want to grow the pie?; 0
0564.00002; All businesspeople should know themselves well enough to answer this fundamental question about what is more important to them.; 0
0564.00003; Growing the pie is a familiar concept to anyone who has studied economics and capitalism.; 0
0564.00004; Through stakeholder mapping, Conscious Capitalism International and its partners, like the Stagen Leadership Academy , are teaching business owners around the world how to expand the pie - because a larger pie simply feeds more people.; 0
0564.00005; Many experienced CEOs who run huge organizations still don't get the idea.; 0
0564.00006; What is a stakeholder exactly?; 0
0564.00007; Most people are familiar with shareholders, those who own stock in a company.; 0
0564.00008; But stakeholders are a wider array of anyone vested in the long-term success of a business. Growing the pie only happens when businesses value all stakeholders, not just shareholders.; 0
0564.00009; For example, there was a tech CEO going through the Stagen Leadership Academy's module on stakeholder mapping.; 0
0564.00010; His company served the healthcare industry and employed over 10,000 people.; 0
0564.00011; One of the first steps in stakeholder mapping is a leader being able to put themselves in the shoes of all their stakeholders to deeply understand their needs. But what does a leader have to do before putting themselves in someone else's shoes?; 0
0564.00012; They first have to remember to take off their own. As the tech CEO contemplated his client's perspective, he realized he didn't fundamentally understand their core needs he had often been thinking only from his perspective about what he knew he could deliver.; 0
0564.00013; He was so disturbed that he couldn't answer the question from his customer's perspective, he couldn't fill out the map, explains Rand Stagen, founder of the Stagen Leadership Academy.; 0
0564.00014; He was a brilliant, successful leader, but he couldn't answer what his customer's deepest needs were in relation to his offering, and when that realization hit him, he saw an opportunity to learn and close a significant strategic gap. I need to talk to them, he said, the light of stakeholder mapping dawning on him. If I do, we could identify new needs and deliver more value.; 0
0564.00015; The tech CEO knew that to get to the heart of the matter, he would have to engage differently and directly, and that is exactly what he did. I need to talk to them, he said, the light of stakeholder mapping dawning on him.; 0
0564.00016; If I do, we could identify new needs and deliver more value.; 0
0564.00017; Stakeholder orientation is a pillar of the Conscious Capitalism movement, but it is also a growing and evolving concept. The basics are straightforward: a stakeholder is anyone with a long-term interest in the flourishing of a business.; 0
0564.00018; Those within the Conscious Capitalism movement understand that by that rubric, employees, customers, suppliers and vendors, investors and shareholders, the larger community, and governments are stakeholders.; 0
0564.00019; There are even some who recognize the environment as an important stakeholder.; 0
0564.00020; But being able to reel off the general categories is not enough.; 0
0564.00021; Once stakeholders have been identified, companies need to understand the needs of each in relation to the products or services that the company provides.; 0
0564.00022; In the traditional business mindset, relations with stakeholders were informed by a zero-sum, win-lose mindset.; 0
0564.00023; Within that framework, a company's leader will be looking to negotiate the best possible vendor deal for his company, regardless of the long-term impact on the supplier.; 0
0564.00024; Conscious Leaders enter negotiations with a conscious, win-win mindset, understanding that if they have a great supplier who helps meet their needs, they have to negotiate a deal that works for both parties.; 0
0564.00025; And this mentality helps all the businesses make more money in the long term. While this may seem a common-sense shift - because squeezing suppliers can put them out of business, leaving the company expending resources to replace them - the win-win model is a relatively recent phenomenon.; 0
0564.00026; The prevailing stakeholder in the Industrial Age, for example, was the shareholder, often leading to poor working conditions for employees, bad deals for suppliers, and higher costs for customers - not to mention a legacy of environmental degradation. Some who are new to the Conscious Capitalism movement often express confusion as they attempt to create an accurate stakeholder map.; 0
0564.00027; They note, for example, that their internet service provider touches their business in a significant way.; 0
0564.00028; Does that make it a stakeholder?; 0
0564.00029; Most likely not.; 0
0564.00030; The key is to understand whether the provider has a concern for the long-term success of one's organization.; 0
0564.00031; While an internet service provider wants any business it can attract, it isn't likely to have a vested interest in a company's long-term success.; 0
0564.00032; On the flipside, those internet-based companies are certainly stakeholders in the ISP's world.; 0
0564.00033; The heart of understanding a stakeholder relationship is recognizing that you care about a company.; 0
0564.00034; It could be a small, local caterer that has become a community hub in your neighborhood. When you grow to appreciate and care for this business, you enter their stakeholder chain as a customer and community member who invested in their particular success, as someone who doesn't see them as a commodity.; 0
0564.00035; Critics sometimes claim that the Conscious Capitalism win-win model is an exercise in chasing rainbows they express doubt that a business can thrive if it is concerned about anything other than its own bottom line.; 0
0564.00036; Tell me what you care about, and I will tell you how big you are.; 0
0564.00037; This caricature ignores the fact that conscious leaders of conscious businesses earn higher returns in the long run than non-conscious businesses. What conscious leaders are doing is expanding the pie, and that is one of the greatest humanitarian efforts any business leader can do. To expand the pie, you have to understand that while you are the chef, all the stakeholders you touch are the ingredients in what you're cooking.; 0
0564.00038; Squeezing vendors may bolster short-term quarterly earnings but hobble future profits by destabilizing a supply chain. Such relationships still require fierce negotiation. But instead of grappling for the best possible short-term deal, conscious leaders will negotiate from a position of dynamic creative tension instead of destructive tension.; 0
0564.00039; This is the heart of a Conscious Culture.; 0
0564.00040; And everyone is interested in culture, because, as management guru Peter Drucker famously stated, culture eats strategy for breakfast.; 0
0564.00041; Traditionally, when people talk about the culture of a company, they usually mean the company culture towards employees.; 0
0564.00042; But in stakeholder theory, the company culture is the culture of all the stakeholder's experience.; 0
0564.00043; Whether your accounting department pays your bills on time or not, is your culture.; 0
0564.00044; The experience of your vendors is the experience of your customers - and don't fool yourself into thinking otherwise.; 0
0564.00045; Stakeholder theory is about recognizing these fundamental truths, and decompartmentalizing the way business leaders view culture.; 0
0564.00046; Rand Stagen, member of the Conscious Capitalism Inc. board, often tells CEOs: Tell me what you care about, and I will tell you how big you are.; 0
0564.00047; You can learn to be bigger by caring about broader stakeholder needs.; 0
0564.00048; Do you want to build a conscious culture?; 0

0579.00001; Neil Hume in London  Print this page  Sirius Minerals remained under pressure as analysts and investors picked over potential financing solutions for its $5bn potash mine on the North York Moors.; 0
0579.00002; Shares in the UK-listed miner halved during the previous session after the company pulled a $500m bond sale and a funding package unravelled.; 0
0579.00003; They fell a further 12 per cent to 4p on Wednesday as analysts lowered price targets and cut forecasts.; 1
0579.00004; The company now has a market value of £270m, around 20 per cent of the money it has already sunk into developing shafts and tunnels for the mine. Based on comments made in yesterday's release and on the conference call the company appears to now be looking at ways of reallocating risk in the financing structure to appeal more to debt capital providers, said Richard Knights of Liberum Capital, as he set a 9p target price. In a nutshell, this likely means annexing the high risk capital items (ie the shaft) from the bond by bringing on third party or strategic investors to finance it.; 0
0579.00005; This kind of solution could improve credit risk on a couple of fronts by removing creditor exposure to the shaft which is perceived to be the highest risk component of the construction and possibly providing a level of strategic expertise and/or additional balance sheet strength.; 0
0579.00006; Richard Knights  Crudely assuming a $500m share sale at 5p, Mr Knights said a strategic investor would end up with a 50 per cent beneficial stake in the Woodsmith potash mine.; 0

JPMorgan  In spite of the financing setback, Mr Knights of Liberum said the economics of the project remained compelling and Sirius would make an ideal target or strategic investment for a major mining business, agribusiness or sovereign wealth fund.; 0
0579.00009; In an environment void of projects that can move the needle for major companies, Woodsmith ticks most of the key investment criteria, he said. The biggest shareholder in Sirius  -  if convertible bonds are taken into account  -  is the Qatar Investment Authority.; 0

0587.00001; Home / Topics / Risk Management  September 26, 2019  |  By Mark Stone  |  4 min read  iStock  Security awareness training is not a one-size-fits-all solution.; 0
0587.00002; While some organizations tailor their training to different departments or seniority levels, it's not a common practice to adjust based on age group, for example.; 0
0587.00003; Since distinct age groups each learn in their own way, however, perhaps the enterprise should take these demographics into account.; 0
0587.00004; When I used to create and administer security awareness training, there were many employees who needed to be put through classes.; 0
0587.00005; The thought of breaking them up by demographic was unfathomable.; 0
0587.00006; When I think back, however, it probably would have been more effective to optimize the training to different groups.; 0
0587.00007; Is training based on age group the answer? Or are other demographics or characteristics more relevant?; 0
0587.00008; I spoke with Dr. Jessica Barker, co-founder of Cygenta and a recognized leader in the human nature of cybersecurity, to offer unique insight into this complex problem. In speaking with many security leaders, I've found it rare for companies to tailor awareness programs to meet the learning requirements of disparate demographics.; 0
0587.00009; This is no different for Barker, who finds that it is only the more mature companies (in security terms) that tailor their awareness programs at all.; 0
0587.00010; Many companies follow a one-size-fits-all approach, which is not going to be particularly effective, she said.; 0
0587.00011; We all respond to different hooks when it comes to awareness-raising. Particularly when we are communicating about threats, it is essential to communicate why the threat is relevant to the people we are addressing.; 0
0587.00012; A great deal of psychological research shows that if we don't do that, we lose people. But let's face it: Separating training groups by age demographic is probably not feasible for every enterprise. Perhaps we're asking the wrong question here, and it's got less to do with one's age than one's personality.; 0
0587.00013; According to Barker, the more relevant you can make awareness-raising to your audience, the more likely you are to have higher engagement rates.; 0
0587.00014; Personality may just be the missing piece of security awareness training. When I do tailor awareness-raising with clients, most will split the organization by roles, so there will be different sessions for the executives, personal assistants, HR, finance, technical teams and others, Barker said. This is a sensible approach, because people in different job roles are often targeted with different types of attacks online.; 0
0587.00015; For instance, employees in finance are more likely to be targeted with CEO fraud, whereas HR professionals might be victims of a spear phishing email with a malicious attachment masquerading as a job application.; 0
0587.00016; Cybersecurity training content suitable for executives should be different from that which will most engage developers.; 0
0587.00017; By customizing training this way, organizations can better address the varying levels of technical knowledge and experience of their employees.; 0
0587.00018; Training that is relevant to the participants, which takes into account their level of understanding and experience, is far more likely to have a positive impact, Barker added. We Are the (Security) Champions What piqued my interest most from my conversation with Barker is the concept of champions programs, which offer a disruptive, yet forward-thinking approach to awareness training.; 0
0587.00019; She explained that a champions program works in the same way as health and safety programs, in which people who do not work in health and safety  -  or, in our case, security  -  for their day job volunteer to be representatives for their department. These volunteers essentially become the friendly face of security in their department and support the security team in spreading security messages more widely. [The champions] also provide the first port of call for anyone in that team who has a security issue or question, Barker said.; 0
0587.00020; They aren't expected to have all of the answers, but can help facilitate a two-way conversation between the business and security, as they are more likely to know what messages will have the biggest impact with their team members and how to more effectively engage everyone. For example, a champion might get a few moments in the spotlight during team meetings to discuss security issues, using the time to target messaging to the interests of people on their team.; 0
0587.00021; Because they know the personalities of their department, they'd know that some may be avid gamers, for instance. In this case, they could include a news story about recent security issues with online games.; 0
0587.00022; If there are a few parents of young children on the team, they could include some tips and resources on how to discuss online safety with younger children. Focus on Empowering, Action-Oriented Security Training Whether or not you believe champions can work for your organization, or even that you could find a way to train for different groups, I'm a firm believer that cybersecurity training should be adjusted to match learning styles.; 0
0587.00023; And there are many distinct learning styles, Barker explained. Some learn best by listening and talking, others by observing, and still others by getting hands-on with a problem.; 0
0587.00024; Taking into account all of these different learning styles, and incorporating a mixture of them in your program, will be most effective.; 0
0587.00025; Use all of the channels at your disposal. This will make your awareness-raising more effective and engaging.; 0
0587.00026; In spite of that, many security awareness strategies work well regardless of demographics.; 0
0587.00027; The most important element, in my experience, is to focus on being empowering, said Barker.; 0
0587.00028; It's easy to talk about the threats, but if we really want to change behaviors, then we must be action-orientated. We can't simply scare people into being more secure we have to show them how to be more secure, as well as why.; 0
0587.00029; If employees aren't feeling empowered, they simply won't be invested. Barker is right about scaring people it may work for some employees, but believe me, I've tried it, and it yielded minimal success.; 0
0587.00030; One last thing: Any of these strategies will need buy-in from the top. While scare tactics may not work on employees, it might just pay dividends for the C-suite when you demonstrate and quantify the risks of not having a robust security awareness training program.; 0
0587.00031; Now that's a scary notion that can't be swept under the carpet.; 0

0588.00001; The illusions of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child extend to its weekly box office reports.; 0
0588.00002; Although the financial statements of the Broadway show indicate that it is still earning the maximum amount of money that it could make from selling every ticket at full price, its producers have been discreetly slashing ticket prices over the past year in an effort to fill the 1,622-seat Lyric Theatre. Whereas the potential revenue of the play during the week that ended on September 16, 2018, was $1,988,464, for example, its potential revenue during the week that ended on September 15, 2019, was only $1,083,869.; 0
0588.00003; In other words, if the same prices from last September were still in effect, then the $1,095,481 that the play made during the recent week would be about 55 percent of its potential revenue, and not the reported 101 percent of its potential revenue.; 1
0588.00004; What the Harry Potter folks appear to be doing is finding the level at which they can maintain 100% capacity, observed Broadway ticketing analyst Mike Rafael, who has helped develop ticket pricing strategies for over 25 Broadway shows.; 0
0588.00005; Selling out is important to maintaining the perception that the show is successful, and, as the demand for tickets at high prices has declined, the producers have reduced the prices to the point at which enough people are willing to purchase them. When supply is fixed (as in this case), a decrease in demand requires a decrease in price to clear the market, stated University of Wisconsin-Madison professor Alan Sorensen.; 0
0588.00006; In 'Economics 101'-speak, changing the price does not increase demand in the sense of shifting the demand curve, he said, explaining that [i]t just moves you to a different point on the same demand curve  -  a point at which more people are willing to buy. Suppose they're currently selling 100 tickets at $100, and, if the demand falls, then maybe they can only sell 80 tickets at $100, described UCLA professor Simon Board in an example.; 0
0588.00007; The producers can lower the price to $80 to raise demand back to 100 tickets, he explained. As a result of the reductions, the average price of a ticket to each part of the two-part play, which was about $154.44 last year, now is only about $78.45.; 1
0588.00008; Since 95% of [the] audiences do see both parts in the same week, the producers insist that our average ticket price for the show is well above the norm.; 0
0588.00009; [W]e believe that the reported gross should reflect that there are four shows a week, and not eight separate performances, they continued, suggesting that that average ticket price reported each week should be doubled to combine both parts of the play.; 0
0588.00010; While it might seem disingenuous to reduce the potential revenue of the show at the box office and then report that it is generating all of its potential revenue, there is nothing unlawful or unusual about the practice. The producers of the $35.5 million play are not inflating its financial figures, and several long-running musicals like The Book of Mormon use a similar pricing strategy.; 0
0588.00011; However, the timing and the magnitude of the reduction are abnormal.; 0
0588.00012; Whereas one industry insider predicted that Harry Potter and the Cursed Child could run 30 years, maybe forever, the play appears to be losing steam less than two years after it opened on Broadway.; 0
0588.00013; The average ticket price on TickPick, an online exchange for reselling tickets, plunged 50 percent from $341.19 in 2018 to $170.60 in 2019. With multiple theme park attractions, a film studio tour, and a new exhibit opening in Manhattan, there are other ways for fans of the franchise to consume its content.; 1
0588.00014; Needing to book a flight to New York, reserve a hotel room, and then set aside a whole day or two nights to watch two parts of a play might be unappealing to some tourists.; 0
0588.00015; Also, after a new mobile game based on the fantasy series failed to match the popularity of Pokémon Go, some people have started to question whether or not the wizard has lost his magic touch.; 0
0588.00016; All of the recent spin-off films and books might have diluted the power of the Harry Potter brand.; 0
0588.00017; In addition, the reduction of about $900,000 in potential revenue is larger than the decrease of other shows that have adopted a similar pricing strategy. For example, The Book of Mormon lowered its potential revenue from about $1,390,976 in 2014 to its current level of $1,190,502.; 0
0588.00018; Generally speaking, navigating the decline in a shows grosses as it ages is the most difficult thing to do on a hit show, Rafael admitted. How you handle the inevitable dip after the first blush, and at what point your grosses 'level off' to a sustainable weekly figure is critical to longevity, he continued.; 0
0588.00019; Since opening, the production gross has leveled to a comfortable place where sales will operate on an ongoing basis, stated the producers of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. As is traditional with most long-running Broadway shows, we're dealing with seasonal fluctuations that will always be reflected in the sales, they continued. While the present potential revenue level is above the break-even point for the play, and the producers are close to recouping their initial investment, Rafael stated that [t]he challenge they have is that there isn't a lot of precedent for plays performing like musicals.; 0
0588.00020; Almost all of the plays that made about the same amount of money as musicals on Broadway were limited engagements featuring popular performers. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a two-part play with an open-ended run now in its second year on Broadway  -  this is completely unprecedented for the New York stage, where no two-part play has ever run more than a season, commented the producers. In addition, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is the highest-grossing play in the history of Broadway, making over $146.5 million since it opened.; 0
0588.00021; Rafael also recognized that an obstacle for the Tony Award-winning play is that it is presented in a large musical house, which means a lot more inventory to move.; 0
0588.00022; Reducing the capacity of the Lyric [during the $33 million renovations before the show opened] was really smart, he commented, although the theater is still more than double the size of some other Broadway playhouses.; 0
0588.00023; Finally, Rafael commented, the fact is that Broadway overall is facing a market correction (a decline of 10 percent from the market peak), and many or all of the long-runners are seeing declines in their grosses year-to-year. It is fascinating to watch as different shows struggle with and adjust to this new reality, he said.; 0

But following an accidental brush fire, public safety notices warning of possible explosions, and a push to have the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approve orbital-class launches with larger rockets, SpaceX is trying to buy out Boca Chica entirely.; 0

When SpaceX first identified Cameron County as a potential spaceport location, we did not anticipate that local residents would experience significant disruption from our presence, the letter states.

0589.00016; The letter added that SpaceX is committed to a fair and equitable process for acquiring this real estate and, to that end, the company hired an independent firm to appraise each property.

0589.00018; The note is dated September 12, indicating the cutoff date for the offer is September 26  -  just two days before Musk is due to deliver a presentation on the Starship development program near the hamlet. The amount of this offer is not negotiable, the letter continues. SpaceX believes that it is very important to offer the same deal to all residents using a consistent approach for determining the amount offered for each property.; 0
0589.00019; This is the fairest approach. For those who commit to a sale, SpaceX said it will cover closing and other real estate costs.; 0
